A novel concrete formulation developed through collaboration between the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester, Cemex UK, Galliford Try, Sika and Northumbrian Water has been successfully laid on site, delivering a major milestone in efforts to decarbonise construction materials.The project culminated in the successful pour of 15m³ of graphene and micronised lime-enhanced concrete at a Northumbrian Water wastewater treatment facility.
This mix achieved up to 49% reduction in CO₂ emissions per cubic metre compared to traditional CEM I concrete, while maintaining comparable compressive strength performance.
From lab to site: delivering the CoMLaG system The lower-carbon concrete, known as CoMLaG (Combining Micronised Limestone and Graphene), was developed and trialled at the GEIC and Cemex’s National Technical Centre.
The mix uses a ternary cement blend, replacing a portion of the high-carbon clinker with GGBS and micronised limestone.
To counter the strength losses typically associated with clinker reduction, a graphene-based addition formulated at GEIC was introduced to enhance strength development.Following extensive lab trials, the project team scaled production through a batch plant in the North East of England using site-available aggregates and raw materials.
The successful site application demonstrated the real-world viability of the mix and laid the foundation for future optimisation and deployment.
Monitoring strength in real time The April 2025 slab pour was monitored using Cemex’s i-Con maturity monitoring system.
The system provided real-time data on curing conditions and strength gain, helping validate the concrete’s performance under actual site conditions.Slump and compressive strength tests showed results consistent with lab data.
As shown in the graph below, the cement blend with graphene achieved a 28-day compressive strength of 78.3 N/mm², closely matching the 82.6 N/mm² of the CEM I control.
While early-age strength values were lower due to reduced clinker content, the inclusion of graphene helped narrow the gap, demonstrating comparable performance to industry standards despite a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions.
Collaborative pathway to lower carbon concrete This collaborative effort demonstrates the potential of advanced material science to support the construction sector’s net zero ambitions.
The GEIC’s work to formulate and stabilise the graphene additive was central to ensuring performance at very low dosing levels (“This project is a fantastic example of industry-led project with significant contributions from University of Manchester research facilities to reduce carbon emissions in construction,” said Lisa Scullion, Application Manager at the GEIC.
“Graphene-enhanced systems like CoMLaG open the door to concrete that performs well while significantly cutting its environmental impact.”“At Cemex, we are committed to pioneering sustainable construction solutions, and this project exemplifies that mission,” said Mike Higgins, Director of Quality and Product Technology at Cemex.
“The successful deployment of the CoMLaG project on a live site demonstrates how the use of advanced materials can help us reduce carbon emissions whilst remaining focussed on performance.
Collaborating with partners like the GEIC, Galliford Try, and Northumbrian Water has been instrumental in accelerating the transition from lab innovation to real-world application.”The next phase of work will focus on optimising the mix, improving admixture compatibility, and validating performance across a wider range of aggregates to support commercial rollout.This successful collaboration between the GEIC, Cemex, Galliford Try, Sika and Northumbrian Water demonstrates how research and industry partnerships can drive meaningful progress in sustainable construction.
Together, the partners are paving the way for lower-carbon concrete solutions that balance performance with environmental responsibility.

The project, led by the University of Kent, and including The University of Manchester, and University College London (UCL), will address the development gap in the diagnostics innovation ecosystem.Accelerating Innovation in DiagnosticsDiagnostics play a vital role in healthcare, informing approximately 70% of clinical decisions.
From detecting diseases to enabling precision medicine, diagnostics have the potential to save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve global health outcomes.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of rapid diagnostic innovation, showcasing how timely diagnostics can mitigate public health crises and support economic resilience.However, over 80% of UK companies developing diagnostics are small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which often face significant barriers in accessing the technical expertise, resources, and infrastructure needed to bring new products to market.
CADDA seeks to address these challenges by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment that bridges academia, industry, the NHS, and regulatory bodies.A National Effort with Global ImpactThe CADDA initiative will harness the strengths of leading institutions in the North and South of England to ensure benefits are distributed across the UK.
By providing SMEs with access to essential knowledge, infrastructure, and resources, CADDA will help overcome the fragmentation in the diagnostics sector that often delays innovation and increases costs.Key stakeholders, including national and local NHS trusts, will be integrated into every aspect of the project to ensure that new diagnostic tools are clinically relevant, ethically sound, and compliant with regulatory standards.
This coordinated approach will deliver diagnostics that meet the highest quality standards while addressing urgent healthcare needs.Broader Benefits for Society and the EconomyIn addition to advancing healthcare, CADDA will enhance animal health, strengthen biosecurity, and drive economic benefits for the UK.
By enabling SMEs to overcome barriers to innovation, CADDA will support regional growth and position the UK as a global leader in diagnostic development.Professor Mark Smales, from the University of Kent and co-Director of CADDA, highlighted the initiative’s transformative potential: “Through coalescing and harnessing the breadth of world class expertise in the UK across universities and research institutes, industry, SMEs, clinicians/end users, regulators and investors, we will be able to bring high quality innovative diagnostics faster to market; our medical community will be able to diagnose medical issues and save lives; and animal health and security will be enhanced.
This will collectively provide wider societal and economic benefits to the UK.”Professor Kathy Kotiadis, also from the University of Kent and co-Director of CADDA, added: “We are excited to support the business development needs of the diagnostics sector.
SMEs often face significant barriers to expansion due to limited access to expertise and information, hindering their ability to introduce new diagnostics to the market, a gap CADDA will fill.”
Published today (15 January 2025) in Nature, this breakthrough centres on a process called nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr), a class of transformation that is widely used across the chemical industries including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.
This enzymatic process offers a greener, more efficient alternative to traditional chemical synthesis.Catalysing chemistrySNAr reactions are crucial in manufacturing many valuable products such as medicines and agrochemicals.
However, conventional methods for carrying out these reactions come with major challenges.
They often require harsh conditions like high temperatures and environmentally harmful solvents.
Established methods of performing SNAr chemistry often produce compounds as isomeric – two or more compounds that have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of the atoms – mixtures, necessitating the use of expensive and time-consuming purification steps.
To overcome these hurdles, a team of researchers, led by Professor Anthony Green and Professor Igor Larrosa, have used directed evolution to develop a new enzyme capable of catalysing SNAr processes.
This new enzyme, named SNAr1.3, performs a range of SNAr reactions with high efficiency and selectivity under mild reaction conditions.
Unlike traditional chemical methods, this enzyme operates in water-based solutions at moderate temperatures, reducing the environmental impact and energy required.How It WorksAs there is no known natural enzyme that could catalyse SNAr reactions, the team initially discovered that an enzyme previously developed in their laboratory for a different chemical transformation could also perform SNAr chemistry, albeit with modest efficiency and selectivity.
By using automated directed evolution, the researchers were able to further engineer this enzyme to have the desired characteristics.
The team evaluated over 4,000 clones before identifying an enzyme SNAr1.3 that contains six mutations and is 160-fold more active than the parent enzyme.
This enzyme efficiently promotes a wide variety of SNAr processes and can generate target products in a single mirror-image form, which is crucial for applications in the pharmaceutical sector.The Benefits of SNAr1.3SNAr1.3 has a number of features that make it an attractive option for chemical production: Efficiency: the enzyme can perform over 4,000 reaction cycles without losing effectiveness, making it highly productive.
Precision: it creates molecules in a single mirror-image form, which is critical for the safety and effectiveness of medicines.
Versatility: SNAr1.3 works with a wide range of chemical building blocks, enabling the creation of complex structures like quaternary carbon centres—a common feature in advanced drugs.
Sustainability: operating under mild, water-based conditions, the enzyme reduces the need for harmful chemicals and energy-intensive processes, making it an environmentally friendly alternative.The team’s work also sheds light on the enzyme’s inner workings.
Using advanced analytic techniques, they uncovered how SNAr1.3’s unique structure allows it to bind and position chemicals precisely, enabling its exceptional performance.
These insights provide a blueprint for designing even more powerful enzymes in the future.A Greener Future for IndustryThe development of SNAr1.3 highlights the potential of biocatalysis and provides a template for future development.
As the world moves towards net zero, and industry is looking for ways to improve efficiency and reduce their environmental impact, biotechnology could be the answer to these pressing challenges.“This is a landmark achievement in biocatalysis,” said Igor Larrosa, Professor and Chair in Organic Chemistry at The University of Manchester.
“It demonstrates how we can harness and even improve on nature’s tools to address some of the toughest challenges in modern chemistry.”What’s Next?While SNAr1.3 is already showing immense promise, the researchers believe this is just the beginning.
With further refinement, the enzyme could be adapted for even more complex reactions, making it a valuable tool in drug development, agricultural chemicals, and materials science.“The possibilities are just starting to emerge,” said Anthony.
“By combining modern protein design with high-throughput testing, we’re optimistic about creating a new generation of enzymes that can revolutionise SNAr chemistry.”This groundbreaking research offers a glimpse into a future where manufacturing essential products is cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient.
For industries looking to reduce their environmental impact while maintaining high standards of quality, SNAr1.3 represents a promising solution.
Their work, published in Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts, could accelerate the development of sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel-derived products like plastics, helping pave the way for a carbon-neutral circular bioeconomy.The research, led by Dr Matthew Faulkner, working alongside Dr Fraser Andrews, and Professor Nigel Scrutton, focused on improving the production of citramalate, a compound that serves as a precursor for renewable plastics such as Perspex or Plexiglas.
Using an innovative approach called “design of experiment,” the team achieved a remarkable 23-fold increase in citramalate production by optimising key process parameters.Why Cyanobacteria?Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms capable of photosynthesis, converting sunlight and CO2 into organic compounds.
They are a promising candidate for industrial applications because they can transform CO2—a major greenhouse gas—into valuable products without relying on traditional agricultural resources like sugar or corn.
However, until now, the slow growth and limited efficiency of these organisms have posed challenges for large-scale industrial use.“Our research addresses one of the key bottlenecks in using cyanobacteria for sustainable manufacturing,” explains Matthew.
“By optimising how these organisms convert carbon into useful products, we’ve taken an important step toward making this technology commercially viable.”The Science Behind the BreakthroughThe team’s research centred on Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803, a well-studied strain of cyanobacteria.
Citramalate, the focus of their study, is produced in a single enzymatic step using two key metabolites: pyruvate and acetyl-CoA.
By fine-tuning process parameters such as light intensity, CO2 concentration, and nutrient availability, the researchers were able to significantly boost citramalate production.Initial experiments yielded only small amounts of citramalate, but the design of experiment approach allowed the team to systematically explore the interplay between multiple factors.
As a result, they increased citramalate production to 6.35 grams per litre (g/L) in 2-litre photobioreactors, with a productivity rate of 1.59 g/L/day.While productivity slightly decreased when scaling up to 5-litre reactors due to light delivery challenges, the study demonstrates that such adjustments are manageable in biotechnology scale-up processes.A Circular Bioeconomy VisionThe implications of this research extend beyond plastics.
Pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, the key metabolites involved in citramalate production, are also precursors to many other biotechnologically significant compounds.
The optimisation techniques demonstrated in this study could therefore be applied to produce a variety of materials, from biofuels to pharmaceuticals.By enhancing the efficiency of carbon capture and utilisation, the research contributes to global efforts to mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources.“This work underscores the importance of a circular bioeconomy,” adds Matthew.
“By turning CO2 into something valuable, we’re not just reducing emissions—we’re creating a sustainable cycle where carbon becomes the building block for the products we use every day.”What’s Next?The team plans to further refine their methods and explore ways to scale up production while maintaining efficiency.
They are also investigating how their approach can be adapted to optimise other metabolic pathways in cyanobacteria, with the aim of expanding the range of bio-based products that can be sustainably manufactured.This research is the latest development from the Future Biomanufacturing Research Hub (FBRH) and was completed in collaboration with the FlexBio scale-up facility at Heriot-Watt University.

The University of Manchester celebrated the graduation of thousands of humanities students from 11 to 18 July 2025.
As they crossed the stage to receive their degrees, many did so not only in recognition of academic achievement but as a step forward in their journey as advocates for a more just, inclusive, and sustainable world.The ceremonies highlighted how many graduates see their studies as a foundation for action.
This year’s cohort, particularly from disciplines such as politics, sociology, philosophy, history, and development studies, echoed the mission of the university’s global inequalities research beacon, a major initiative working to tackle injustices locally and globally.Graduates expressed their aspirations through messages inspired by the beacon’s Wishing Tree activity, which invited participants to write down one action that could help build a fairer society.
Wishes included calls to stop racism and islamophobia, equality for all people, and making sure that all children have access to free school meals and proper academic support.
One standout idea called for dedicated library sessions to support adult literacy, highlighting education as a tool for empowerment.
Across the graduates’ messages, education emerged as a dominant theme, closely followed by concerns around humanitarian issues and the future of democracy.
The global inequalities research beacon, one of the university’s five flagship research areas, plays a vital role in addressing some of the world’s most pressing issues, from poverty and housing injustice to climate resilience and workplace equality.
Its researchers work with communities, policymakers, and international partners to advance the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 10: Reduced inequalities.At the heart of the beacon’s work is collaboration, not only with experts, but also with the very people affected by inequality.
This approach aligns closely with the values expressed by this year’s humanities graduates, many of whom have been directly involved in research projects, public engagement initiatives, or community-based placements.These ideas will continue to inform the beacon’s future research priorities.
As part of its mission, the global inequalities team is committed to amplifying young people’s voices in shaping the policies and wellbeing systems that define the future.
At the Universally Manchester Festival, people from all walks of life came together to prove that even the smallest action can spark change.
From ambitious ideas to everyday kindness, the Wishing Tree stood as a testament to Greater Manchester’s commitment to a fairer future.
The ‘Getting Serious About Sustainability: Research, Education and Advocacy’ symposium, held from 22–23 May 2025, was the first major event organised by the new working group Sustainability@SEED , led by Heather Alberro, Lecturer in Sustainability at the School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED).Over two engrossing and thought-provoking days, dozens of staff and students from across The University of Manchester community, alongside practitioners, artists, and activists from across the UK, came together for transdisciplinary discussions on the fundamental transformations needed to challenge systemic drivers of unsustainability and chart more liveable pathways forward.A key aim was to foreground perspectives and disciplines not typically centred in STEM-dominated sustainability discourses, namely the humanities, social sciences, and activist voices .
Key themes and topics included: the transformative role of hope and imaginaries; cultivating our ecological selves; working with and through climate anxiety; the relationship between war and ecological breakdown; collectively crafting new stories; generating value shifts and cultivating relations of ‘integrity over transaction’; opting for slow research and travel; how mosses might help us rethink the more-than-human ethical dimensions of sustainability; how to disrupt universities’ complicity in climate breakdown; and the need for a distributed ethics that cherishes individuals through collectives.As speaker Susan Brown (MIE) asked, “What if education were to beat not to the neoliberal economic clock, but to the earth’s clock?” How can we develop an intersectional, ecological approach to sustainability, that recognises extreme inequality, political polarisation, misogyny, systemic racism, transphobia, pollution, and biodiversity collapse as deeply entangled and indivisible crises?
And how might we better engage actors beyond our immediate circles, ensuring we don’t merely preach to the converted?In service of keeping hope alive, these crucial conversations will continue in future events over the coming academic year.

New sentences found on https://manchester.ac.uk/about/our-story:
Our story begins at the height of the Industrial Revolution.
The city we call our home was at the epicentre of change as the modern world began to emerge and a new idea of education arose for the first time in history.
Founded in 1824, the Manchester Mechanics’ Institution was formed as part of a national movement for the education of working men.
The pressure for technical education increased in the later decades of the century and in 1883 John Henry Reynolds converted the Institute into the Manchester Technical School – successfully creating a programme of classes that served the industrial needs of the Manchester region.
The School went through several name changes in the decades that followed before an agreement was reached in 1905 with the newly independent Victoria University of Manchester for the professors at the now College of Technology to constitute the University’s Faculty of Technology.
After World War Two the College was renamed the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).
As the Institute grew, so did the Victoria University.
The University started its life as Owens College following a legacy left by industrialist John Owens in 1846.
By the 1860’s the College had transformed its vision and focused not only on the transmission of knowledge but also its creation.
The John Owens building, designed by Alfred Waterhouse, was completed in 1873 before the College became the first constituent part of the Victoria University – England’s first civic university – in 1880.
Both pre- and post-World Wars the University went on to expand significantly.
These two institutions worked closely together throughout the 20th century, representing research and teaching across science and the humanities, before coming together in 2004 to form the largest single-site university in the UK – The University of Manchester.

New sentences found on https://manchester.ac.uk/about/vision:
This new vision and strategic plan for The University of Manchester will take us into our third century.
It builds on a rich heritage of discovery, social change and pioneering spirit that is at the heart of our University and our city region.
"As a proud Manchester institution with a growing international reach, we have created this plan based on our fundamental belief that the purpose of our University is to deliver benefit to society and the environment, and to protect our unique status as an open place of enquiry and challenge."
The foundation of this vision and strategic plan remains our three core goals of research and discovery, teaching and learning, and social responsibility, which are encapsulated in our motto: knowledge, wisdom and humanity.
It builds on our strengths while taking the University in new directions.
It points to a future where we will expand our world-leading research to address the most challenging global questions and exploit our capability for interdisciplinary research; transform the way our students learn to make them the most employable graduates and truly global citizens; and ensure that all our activities make a positive difference to society.
The strategic plan reinforces what already makes The University of Manchester distinctive: our excellence, openness and inclusivity, our longstanding commitment to social responsibility, our scale and breadth, our tradition of innovation, and our very close bonds with, and location at the heart of, Manchester.
We have built our vision and strategic plan on extensive consultation with colleagues, students, alumni, and regional and national stakeholders.
This approach has ensured a shared creation of ideas and allowed us to test the resilience of the priorities that we have identified.
It has also enabled us to explore and refine how to deliver them.
This is a vision and strategic plan of substance, supported by detailed delivery plans.
Our success will be evidenced through independent measures of our core activities.
Universities such as ours are ideally positioned to help address many of the worldâs major challenges, finding new means to deliver environmental sustainability, close the gap of societal inequalities, improve health, inform and empower citizens, and create the leaders of the future.
While the plan is broad in its scope, with stretching ambitions in many places, it contains clear priorities set within each theme and measurable outcomes.
We will, of course, be agile and adaptable to external change, but we will hold onto the ambitions set out here to ensure that we are well placed for the future.

We offer life-changing experiences to encourage lifelong learning.
Delivering research-driven and personalised teaching, we work in partnership with students to build unique experiences in a framework of excellence, inclusivity, and social responsibility – promoting a true sense of belonging.
Our outcomes-based curricula are increasingly informed by business, industry and research reflecting the student voice, and our digital and blended experiences will allow flexible learning both on and off campus.
Working in partnership with our students, we co-create tailored Student Experience Action Plans, enlivened by research and guided by critical review.
We ensure our students have a voice and, together, we find solutions to improve provision.
Initiatives include:

At Manchester, our NSS scores for learning resources, learning community, and learning opportunities continue to climb.
Through our emerging Student Survey Strategy we will streamline and maximise our methods for gathering and listening to the student voice, providing insight at every stage of the student journey – including the piloting of live, real-time student feedback.
Unit surveys are an important part of our commitment to listen to students, and to deliver improvements in student satisfaction.
We invite students to have their say – about how and what they are being taught.
We enable progression to a highly skilled future.
Our students develop the skills, confidence and awareness to thrive in a challenging world and uncertain future, becoming the leaders of tomorrow and driving the change we want to see – both globally and locally.
We are discovering how learning analytics will enable our students of the future to visualise and track their progress, set goals, and evaluate their academic development – as well as manage their own motivation for learning.
We're removing hurdles to learning, improving access to the University and ensuring student success and progression, regardless of background or identity.
Challenging targets have been set in our Access and Participation Plan, and our Student Success Strategy is designed to enable all students to reach their full potential.
We will tackle awarding gaps and continue to encourage progression to employment and further study for all.

The University of Manchester has strengthened its position among the world’s best universities, rising to 46th globally in the 2025 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).
The prestigious annual list, compiled by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy, assesses more than 2500 institutions worldwide and publishes the top 1000.
Manchester’s strong performance also saw it improve to 13 th place in Europe while maintaining its place as the 6th best university in the UK, underlining its reputation for research excellence, global impact and academic achievement.
Since 2003, the ARWU has been recognised as one of the most influential global university rankings.
It measures academic and research performance using a set of objective indicators including the number of highly cited researchers, publications in Nature and Science and articles indexed in major citation databases.
It also includes Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals – alumnus Professor Simon Johnson became the 26th Nobel laureate associated with The University of Manchester last October, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his groundbreaking research into understanding wealth disparities between different nations.
Rankings like ARWU never capture the full story of what we value as a university - our culture, our community, and our commitment to impact - however, they are a reminder of our position as one of Europe’s leading universities and of the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.
“For an institution of our scale and ambition, continued progress on the global stage is both a challenge and an opportunity," Duncan added.
The 2025 ARWU result follows a strong year for Manchester in other leading global rankings - in June, it was named the 35th best university in the world in the QS World University Rankings .
The power of the University’s social and environmental impact has also been recognised on a global scale, being the only university in the top ten in both the QS World University Sustainability Rankings and Times Higher Education Impact Rankings, in recognition of its contribution towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The University’s research strength is further evidenced by the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), in which 93% of research activity was rated either ‘world-leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*).
“Manchester has always been a place where world-class research meets real-world impact,” said Vice-President for Research Professor Colette Fagan.
“We are proud of our achievements, but even more excited about what lies ahead.” The full 2025 ARWU list and methodology can be explored at ShanghaiRanking’s website .

He will be remembered not only for his extraordinary philanthropy, but for his entrepreneurial spirit – one that continues to inspire and shape the ethos of Alliance Manchester Business School.
Professor Duncan Ivison, President and Vice-Chancellor of The University of Manchester also commented: “Lord Alliance was a close friend to the University and a remarkable figure whose contributions extended far beyond it.
His belief in the transformative power of education created opportunities for generations of students, while his leadership and philanthropy shaped the Alliance Manchester Business School and the wider Manchester region.
His story will remain a source of inspiration for years to come, and his legacy will endure in the lives he touched and the institutions he helped to build.”

● £4.8m funding awarded from Research England to supercharge the next stage of pioneering city-to-city partnership
● Led by The University of Cambridge and The University of Manchester, and supported by the two Mayoral Combined Authorities, City Councils, alongside businesses and investors
A groundbreaking partnership between The University of Manchester and The University of Cambridge has been awarded £4.8 million by Research England to accelerate inclusive growth and innovation collaboration.
As the UK’s first cross-UK innovation partnership, it will pioneer a new model of place-to-place collaboration and help drive economic growth for the UK- setting an example for other cities to follow.
With further investment from the two universities, the total funding for the partnership will be £6m.
The partnership will be led by Unit M and Innovate Cambridge - the universities’ respective innovation capabilities - with support from the two Mayoral Combined Authorities, City Councils, businesses and investors.
It is a prime example of how a university-led, cross-UK innovation collaboration can enhance the UK's global competitiveness and foster innovation-driven growth.
"Our partnership with Cambridge marks a new model of collaboration between UK universities.
It brings together the distinctive strengths of each of our universities and cities, connecting two of the great innovation ecosystems to scale up what we can achieve.
This new approach to innovation accelerates the time between discovery and impact, getting ideas into the real economy and our communities even more quickly to drive inclusive growth.”
This initiative responds directly to the UK government’s imperative for universities to support the delivery of the national Industrial Strategy and make a stronger contribution to economic growth.
Professor Duncan Ivison, President and Vice Chancellor of The University of Manchester, commented : "Our partnership with Cambridge marks a new model of collaboration between UK universities.
Professor Lou Cordwell, Chief Executive of Unit M, said: “Universities are increasingly taking a lead in convening and catalysing their innovation ecosystems.
By bringing together investors, businesses, entrepreneurs, academics, and public sector agencies, this partnership will create new opportunities and stimulate investment into the innovation economy.
We are proud at Unit M to be part of such a pioneering partnership, and look forward to continuing to work with Cambridge.” Professor Deborah Prentice, University of Cambridge Vice-Chancellor, commented: “This pioneering initiative brings together the combined strengths of Cambridge and Manchester to create something that is truly ground-breaking.
By connecting our cities, we’re helping to build a more collaborative and dynamic environment in which innovative research can connect with industry, venture capital and entrepreneurs to drive economic growth and deliver real benefits for people and places across the UK .” Science Minister and Oxford-Cambridge Growth Champion, Lord Vallance, said: “This pioneering partnership is proof that our ambitions for the Oxford-Cambridge Corridor can and will fire up economic growth across the length and breadth of the UK, which is critical to our Plan for Change.
“Cambridgeshire and Greater Manchester are forging a path I hope others will follow.
Science is always stronger when we work together, and stronger research ties between the UK’s great regions will only lead to more investment, more opportunities, and more breakthroughs, from health to clean energy and beyond.”
Jessica Corner, Executive Chair of Research England , commented: “This investment underscores our commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration across England.
By connecting the vibrant ecosystems of Cambridge and Manchester, we aim to drive significant economic growth and create a model for place-based innovation that can be replicated nationwide." At the core of the partnership is the exchange of complementary innovation assets to ensure real-world impact.
Both cities already have strong R&D capabilities and strengths in leading-edge sectors such as AI, life sciences, and advanced materials.
Cambridge has deep investor networks but experiences growth constraints due to its small scale, higher costs, and lack of development land.
Manchester provides that scale, affordability for start-ups and scale-ups, and a large talent pool - but has a less mature support ecosystem.
The Research England funding will be used in three key areas: ecosystem activation and integration; growing investment; and testing and learning.
● Ecosystem activation and integration: It will strengthen relations within and between the innovation ecosystems of the two cities, to create a vibrant and ambitious cross-city innovation network.
This aims to create progressive new approach inclusive growth.
● Growing investment: It will harness the combined strengths of both universities and partner cities to support start-ups and scale-ups to secure funding and grow, attract innovation-intensive FDI to the UK, and stimulate investment into R&D.
● Testing and learning: It will pilot new approaches and share best practice for delivering ecosystem collaboration and inclusive growth.
This will allow other cities, the wider higher education sector community, and local and national governments in the UK and internationally to learn from the partnership.

Taking place across four days from the 16 th to 19 th June, the festival will bring together industry leaders, policymakers and academic experts to discuss the role businesses have to play in helping society respond to the pressing challenges and opportunities of our time.

Alongside this, other events will be running throughout the festival focussing on themes including professional development, the future of the Third Sector and empowering entrepreneurs.
The Festival of Business comes as AMBS celebrates six decades of empowering leaders, thinkers and visionaries across the globe to deliver transformative and innovative change.
Ken McPhail, Head of Alliance Manchester Business School, said: "We are currently living through a critical period as we face challenges including economic growth and regional disparities, global geopolitical upheaval and climate change.
Rising to these challenges won’t be possible without business playing key leadership role in finding solutions and capitalising on opportunities."

At AMBS, we want to make sure that we’re continuing to carry this spirit forward as we navigate the coming decades collectively.
We’re looking forward to welcoming our exciting line-up of business leaders, policymakers and forward thinkers to continue this legacy and discuss new ways to create more opportunity and prosperity for all.

For most courses, this will be shortly after you have received an offer, but in some circumstances, we may need additional information later in the admissions process.
We’ll contact you if this is the case.
Eligibility criteria for Home status for tuition fee purposes can be found on the â¯ UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website .
Please note we're unable to act on proposed changes to eligibility rules for home fees status until they are passed and incorporated into UK law and the guidance on 'Home' status eligibility by the UKCISA.
Please note that your fee assessment cannot be carried out before your study application is received.
It is your responsibility to clarify or query your tuition fee status during the admissions process if you believe you have been misclassified.

If your tuition fee status is not clear from the information provided in your application, then your status may be classed as ‘Under Review’ and you will be required to submit a Tuition Fee Assessment form and provide copies of supporting documentation.
Your tuition fee status is determined by a specialist Tuition Fee Assessment team which is independent of your School/Department admissions team who make academic decisions on your course application.

If you apply to any of these, you may be contacted shortly after your application is received to complete a fee assessment.

When assessing your fee status for a new course, we will not take into consideration any decision which may have been made by another institution or organisation.

If you do not submit the required Tuition Fee Assessment form or requested additional information by the deadline provided to you, your tuition fee status will be automatically set to Overseas.
You will have the opportunity to complete the tuition fee assessment process before registration if you contact the Tuition Fee Assessment team, but your tuition fee status will remain as Overseas until the process is fully completed.
If you believe that you have been incorrectly classified as a Home or Overseas student for the purpose of tuition fees you should familiarise yourself with the Fee Assessment Appeal Procedure for Applicants which is available on our Student terms and conditions, policies and procedures page.
There are limited circumstances in which your fee status can change part-way through your course.
If you have been classified as an Overseas student for the purposes of tuition fees, your status can only change at the next point tuition fees are due (next registration) and only under specific circumstances in accordance with UKCISA regulations .
If you feel you have grounds under the specific circumstances set out in the UKCISA regulations, please contact the Tuition Fee Assessment team with detailed information about your change in circumstances.
It is never advisable to begin a course unless you have a guaranteed way of paying both your tuition fees and living costs for its entire duration.

Understand your offer and the next steps to becoming a student at Manchester.
We’ve put together some advice on what happens after you've received your offer from us.
If you have any further questions about your offer, please contact the relevant admissions team.
Congratulations!â¯â¯â¯ â¯â¯
Information about your offer and any conditions will be sent to you via UCAS.â¯â¯We can only confirm your place once you receive your exam results.
If you've already met the entry requirements for your course, we may have made you an unconditional offer.
â¯â¯â¯
Mostâ¯exam results areâ¯receivedâ¯automatically.â¯ However,â¯there are some examinations that you'll need to tell us about.
Read the ’ Your results ’â¯section below for more information.â¯â¯
Once you’ve accepted your offer, there are a few important steps you'll need to complete before registration:
These steps are essential – you'll need to complete them once your place is confirmed in order to register.
You may need to wait until you receive your exam results before we can confirm your place.â¯
Results that we receive automatically
If you’re studying for any of the following qualifications, we’ll receive an electronic copy of your results from UCAS:
Results you’ll need to send us
If UCAS doesn't provide us with your results, you’ll need to email high-quality scanned colour copies or colour photographs of the official exam results transcripts to your School/Department admissions team by 31 August.
Some Schools/Departments may set an earlier deadline – if so, this will be highlighted in your offer on UCAS.
You'll need to send official copies as soon as you receive them.
If you expect your results to arrive later than the deadline, please contact your admissions team as soon as possible.
We’ll verify all qualifications not provided via UCAS.
This usually happens during the application process, and you may not be able to register until your results are confirmed as genuine.
In rare cases, we may ask to see your original documents at registration or during your studies.
We recommend bringing your original qualification certificates with you to Manchester.
If any of your certificates or transcripts have been issued in a language other than English, you'll need to include official, authenticated English translations – a requirement of the UK government’s visa regulations .
The translation should be on official letter-headed paper, clearly stated that it is an accurate translation of the original, and include all the following pieces all of the following:â¯
The translation needs to be completed by an official translator/translation service.
We can't accept translations by agents unless the agency offers a recognised translation service and the translator can demonstrate appropriate credentials (for example NAATI, CATTI or NAETI).
English language modules studied as part of the agent's degree course, for example TEM-4 or TEM-8, are not considered appropriate credentials.â¯
We’ll review your results as soon as we receive them.â¯
If you meet the conditions of your offer
If you meet all the conditions, UCAS will notify you and our admissions team will confirm your place.
You can check the status of your application viaâ¯ UCAS .â¯
If your grades are lower than expected
If you narrowly miss the academic conditions of our offer, we may still be able to confirm your place.
This will depend on course availability and whether we believe you're prepared for the course.
In some cases, we may offer you a place on a different course.â¯
However, as many of our courses are highly competitive, we're usually not able to consider lower grades.
Ifâ¯UCAS shows that you've been unsuccessful, unfortunately, we cannot offer you a place at Manchester.â¯
We recommend checking theâ¯UCAS website for course vacancies at other universities and asking for advice from your school or college on next steps.â¯â¯
Congratulations, you're coming to Manchester!â¯
Discover more about becoming a student at Manchester on ourâ¯ Welcome website .â¯
If you'd like to request a deferral, please email your admissions team and include:â¯
If UCAS shows a change of course offer, this means we're unable to confirm your place on your chosen course but would like to offer you a place on a different course.
You can accept or decline this via UCAS.â¯
If you'd like to speak to someone about your unconditional change of course offer, contact the Admissions Team in your School or Department.
If UCAS shows that you've been unsuccessful, unfortunately, we cannot offer you a place on your chosen course at Manchester.â¯
We recommend that you check theâ¯UCAS websiteâ¯to see what vacancies are available at other universities, and you should ask for advice from your school or college on next steps.â¯â¯
If your application is still showing as a 'Conditional Firm (CF)' on UCAS,â¯ contact the Admissions Team in your School or Department.
Your decision could be outstanding for a number of reasons, so get in touch, and we can help advise on next steps.â¯
You can self-release your place via the UCAS Hub.
Releasing yourself into clearing means you'll be giving up your spot at Manchester, so it's important to take some time to consider whether this is the right decision for you before you decline your place.â¯

An online pre-university scheme to help develop study skills and prepare for undergraduate courses.
Applications for the 2025 Scheme are now open.
The Manchester Distance Access Scheme (MDAS) is an online access programme designed for students who hold an offer from The University of Manchester for courses starting in September 2025 or deferred entry in 2026.
If you're here because it was mentioned in your UCAS offer, then you're in the right place.
You'll receive an offer of one A-level grade below the standard offer for your course at the University (for example, if your offer is AAA, it would become AAB).*
66% of students who completed the Manchester Distance Access Scheme in 2024 progressed onto an undergraduate course at The University of Manchester.
* Offers are decided by the academic School and some courses may still need specific grades in certain subjects.
If you're studying for a different qualification (such as a BTEC Extended Diploma), email your academic School to see if you can take part.
The scheme comprises two elements.
Firstly, you’ll complete an Academic Skills Module consisting of five tasks, each with a different focus:
Secondly, you’ll complete an academic piece of work on the subject you’ll be studying at degree level.
This could be a written assignment, online assessed unit or problem-solving quiz.
These are subject to change and depend on A-level exams.
If there are any major changes to the timeline below, we'll contact you as soon as possible.
The Academic Skills Module should take five hours to complete and will sharpen your skills for university-level studies.
The Module consists of five tasks that enhance your existing skills like essay writing to suit a university setting.
It also introduces you to less familiar topics (such as plagiarism) to boost your confidence in handling first-year assessments.
You can easily fit this Module around your Level 3 qualifications, and enrolment occurs on a rolling basis once you’ve received a study offer.
The Mini Degree Module is your preparation for university assessments.
Whether it’s short-answer questions or online quizzes, this Module eases your transition from sixth form or college to university.
87% of those who completed MDAS 2023 said that the programme made them feel more confident in starting their university studies, and 98% said that the scheme made them feel more prepared to start their first year.
Once you’ve completed the Scheme, you’ll receive confirmation before  A-level results day and enjoy a one-grade differential offer during results confirmation and clearing.
Only a selection of foundation courses are eligible for MDAS, these are listed below.
The academic Schools and courses involved in the Manchester Distance Access Scheme for 2025 are:
Arts, Humanities and Languages
Science, Materials and Engineering
Health and Medicine
If you don't see the course you’re interested in listed here, then it might not be available for MDAS 2025 entry at the moment but you can check back throughout the year to see if it becomes available.
The School of Social Sciences also run their own access scheme.
To be part of the Scheme, you'll need to have an offer from The University of Manchester and if you choose Manchester as your ‘Firm’ choice, you'll be able to join the Mini Degree Module and complete the scheme.
You'll also need to meet certain background criteria, including:
Visit our eligibility page and enter your home postcode to find out if you live in one of our postcode target areas.
If your ‘Home postcode flag’ is marked as ‘Yes’ this means you could be eligible to join MDAS in 2025.
If you're a UK applicant under 21, we'll consider your background and achievements (called contextual data) along with your undergraduate application, to make sure we find and accept talented individuals no matter your background.
If you live in an area with lower progression to higher education and your school or sixth form has performed below the national average, or you’re care-experienced, you may be eligible for a contextual offer.
This means you could get an offer one grade lower than the standard entry requirements without having to apply separately.
Any MDAS offer will be made in addition to the contextual offer.
If you meet the WP Plus criteria, choose Manchester as your 'Firm' choice and successfully complete MDAS, you could receive an offer with even lower entry requirements (for example, if the standard offer is AAA, your offer would be ABB).
For more details on contextual data and the meaning of WP/WP Plus, visit our contextual data pages.
Applications for the 2025 scheme are now open.
To apply, please fill out this survey .

Good degree results from recognised institutions are a big factor in assessing postgraduate taught applications, as well as:
We receive lots of excellent applications each year and some of our courses receive more applications than available places so unfortunately, we can’t offer places to all applicants who achieve the minimum entry qualifications.
Where places are limited, we offer them to applicants who best meet our selection criteria and who, we believe, are most likely to benefit from their chosen course and contribute to their academic School and the wider University.
For more information, download our Student Recruitment, Selection and Admissions Policy (PDF document, 326 KB).

We advise that all new students bring their original qualification documents with them when they come to Manchester.
For many applicants, we automatically confirm the authenticity of their qualifications when we receive their results.
