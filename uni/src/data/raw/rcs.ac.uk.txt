You are asked to attend a performance of a production of your choice and be able to discuss your observations of this production with the panel.
Ideally this should be a live production but, if this is not possible, a recorded or streamed stage production can be used.
This should be a recent professional production if possible but must not be one you have worked on.
This may be an opportunity to challenge yourself by choosing a type of performance or venue that you have not experienced before.
Remember we want to hear you talk about this so feel free to use notes to help you but do not write an essay to read out.
You should endeavour to give a clear account to the interview panel of the production elements such as the overall set & costume design, staging, costume, props, lighting, sound, and stage technology.
Whilst an overview of the directing or performances is sometimes useful, this is not what we want you to focus on.
Remember that as a member of the audience your opinion is valid and should be used to comment on the overall effect of the production and whether there was any specific element that you personally liked or disliked.
You may also be asked to comment on how you would have approached certain elements differently, given the chance.
It is often helpful to provide supplementary evidence of your visit such as publicity material or personal notes and sketches to illustrate a point.
Choose one of the following plays:
Source a copy of the script and study it with a view to communicating how you would address the production elements of this play relevant to your chosen major study subject (you do not necessarily need to cover the whole play).
Assessment of this project is based on your ability to apply yourself to a given task and your ability to discuss and demonstrate practical and creative solutions to the production challenges.
What you need to do:
You should consider this task in relation to your identified major study subject and the design and/or practical staging challenges raised by the script for that area.
Applicants who apply on time are invited to an interview by email, approximately three weeks before.
Interviews will take place in person, however online interviews are available for those who are unable to travel to RCS.

This is the UK’s only Bachelor of Music curriculum dedicated to traditional and folk music, and to the music of the Scottish Highland Bagpipe.
Aspiring performers on this course explore Scotland’s unique and dynamic musical traditions as a conceptual, critical and creative framework within which to achieve a historically informed yet distinctively personal voice as a piper and artist.
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and The National Piping Centre offer a specialist degree that allows pipers to study piping within the context of Scottish traditional music to the highest level.
This unique course offers the chance for students to concentrate on the total study of piping in all forms, whilst also developing their performance skills under some of the best players in the world.
Students receive instruction individually and in small groups and workshop settings.
The degree includes substantial study of the history, repertoire, traditions, performance practice and organology of the bagpipes, producing expert performers with a deep understanding of their own, and other, traditions.
The nature of the Highland bagpipe and its repertoire, defined by highly individual and highly complex parameters of performance and musical structure, demands a teaching approach which integrates the instrument with the rest of Scottish traditional music while simultaneously respecting its uniqueness.
The piping degree is therefore carefully structured to give the most thorough grounding possible in vital specialisms such as solo piping, piobaireachd, light music, and piping in a folk ensemble context, whilst sharing the same structure and range of contextual curriculum as in the main Traditional Music department.
The two programmes share an immense amount of common ground and the institutional emphasis is always on co-operation.

It is a doctoral programme comparable in scope, level and ambition to the PhD, but squarely focused on making a significant and original contribution to the artistic field within which the work resides.
You can choose to study this course full-time (three years) or part-time (six years).
The vision of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is to be Scotland’s globally-recognised and inspirational leader in learning for the performing arts, attracting and nurturing the next Scottish and international creative talent.
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland offers opportunities for suitably qualified students to work towards the achievement of a Doctor of Performing Arts in appropriate areas of enquiry.
Applications will only be successful if it is clear that the proposed work can best be undertaken within a conservatoire context, in which performance and/or creation is held central, and that the Conservatoire has the appropriate artistic expertise to offer appropriate artistic mentorship and guidance.
Programme Code: 470F (Full-time) or 470P (Part-time)
Doctor of Performing Arts students will pursue a special programme of artistic practice and supplementary study.
This will comprise:
A) A series of Professional Projects (360 credits, level 12)
B) Individually tailored Supplementary Studies (120 credits, level 7 and above)
C) A Written Component (60 credits, level 12)
All elements must be passed for the successful award of the degree.
These are the core of the programme of study.
Within the broad outline of approximately 3600 hours of work, the student, in consultation with the supervisor, will propose any appropriate set of projects for the approval of the Research Degrees Committee.
In practice, this component of the portfolio will normally include 3-4 Artistic Projects and one Development Project.
Recognising the core aim of developing advanced artistic practice, the Professional Projects may be assessed ‘live’ (for example, through a performance) or through appropriate media (such as video or audio recording).
Artistic Projects
The artistic projects will form a coherent artistic whole.
In some programmes of study, this coherence may be self-evident (a focus on particular techniques, a body of repertoire, or a well-defined professional context), but in others it will require more careful articulation.
In all cases, however, the artistic projects will clearly establish a well-integrated body of artistic work: they must be focused enough to permit the candidate to make a significant and original contribution to her or his professional field.
Supervisors will be able to offer guidance on the level of work required in each project: all projects will demonstrate some work at a professional, post-Masters level in the chosen artistic field.
Development Project
The purpose of the Development Project is to broaden the professional development of the candidate by facilitating significant work beyond the framework of the core Artistic Projects.
The Development Project is therefore designed to challenge the candidate to apply their artistic insights in new and unfamiliar contexts, expand their professional skills, and provide opportunities to maximise the impact of their artistic work.
The scale of the Development Project will normally be similar to one of the Artistic Projects: the Development Project therefore represents a substantial and extended piece of work.
The nature of the Development Project will depend significantly on the proposed Artistic Projects: where these are located primarily within formal contexts such as the studio, concert hall or performance space, candidates will be encouraged to expand their professional versatility by pursuing the Development Project in a community or business setting.
The detailed proposal for a candidate’s programme of study will explain how his or her Development Project complements the proposed Artistic Projects.
Together, the Professional Projects are the heart of the programme of study.
Supplementary Studies are taught courses, to a total of 120 credits, the purpose of which is to broaden and deepen the candidate’s artistic practice.
In the detailed proposal for the programme of study, the candidate will propose a programme of taught study that will support the development of her or his artistic practice.
These taught courses may be drawn from the Conservatoire or the University course catalogues (dependent on availability and pre-requisites), and may also be pursued at other higher education institutions, such as the Open University.
Procedures for credit transfer will be used to ensure the widest possible flexibility, and the specification for doctorates provided within the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework allows that these courses be at any level between SCQF 7 and 12 (that is, any level from first year undergraduate, to doctoral level).
These taught courses may be theoretical, practical or research-related, and may be ‘close’ to the candidate’s proposed artistic field or, where a clear case can be made, more ‘distant’ from that field.
For example, a student pursuing a project focussed on 19th Century German Lieder might propose Supplementary Studies relating to German language and poetry, but could also propose a programme of work focussed on related philosophical currents, or social history, where a case can be made that these will directly enrich his or her artistic practice.
Likewise, a contemporary performance maker might propose a programme of supplementary study that centres on cultural theory, but could equally pursue studies in economics or natural history, where a case can be made that these studies will meaningfully inform his or her artistic practice.
The aim of the written component is to provide a reflective synthesis of the Professional Projects and Supplementary Studies, drawing them together into a coherent whole and contextualising the contribution made by the candidate to their chosen artistic field.
In particular, the written component should set out the artistic and intellectual context for the Professional Projects, reflect self-critically on the process of professional artistic development (including the role of the Supplementary Studies undertaken), and articulate the artistic insights achieved through the programme of study.
The written component will be 12,500 — 15,000 words (excluding bibliography and appendices), unless the Research Degree Committee has specifically granted permission for the word limit to be increased.
The central theme of my DPerf is to distill my musical essence down to its core ideals and apply these to both jazz and classical music.
I am looking to take the most interesting characteristics that each style has to offer and look for ways to combine them along with my own musical personality in order to find new possibilities.
There are many differences between jazz and classical music, but there is also so much common ground, and it is here through expanding this common ground that I am looking to find new possibilities of process and consequently sound.
I also have several projects which look to directly combine jazz and classical music.

GTCS registered teachers who have a remit for an arts subject within their school teaching context can use this programme to build evidence of their commitment to their professional learning as an arts educator.
We include the following within our definition of an arts ‘subject’: music, dance, drama and art and design.
For all participants , the programme can be used to develop knowledge and skills as an arts educator and to build an evidence-base to demonstrate commitment their professional learning in designing and delivering learning activities.
For lecturers/tutors working in a further or higher education context with learners at SCQF Level 7 or above (or equivalent), this programme leads to Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy.
The programme is delivered over a two year period, through a combination of online workshops, distance and independent learning, weekend seminars and work-based learning.
At its core, the programme is primarily concerned with helping arts education professionals engage in a process of active enquiry into their teaching practice.
The aim of the programme is to encourage you to investigate your teaching practice and develop the skills of critical reflection, academic writing, scholarship and practice-based research whilst engaged in a sustained process of development with the aim of enhancing your teaching practice.
In year one, the focus will be on developing the knowledge and skills required to evidence the quality of your teaching practice.
Over this year you will develop a working knowledge of the definitions, conventions and priorities expressed within arts education, helping you engage with policies, philosophies and practices that are most relevant to your specific context.
The submissions will encourage you to use research and critical reflection to ensure that your teaching practices are underpinned by robust evidence both in relation to your subject area, and to credible learning theories.
This is a 30-credit module designed to help you to build an evidence-base to support a critical evaluation of your teaching practices.
Having articulated the philosophies, principles and values that underpin your current teaching practice, you will design, deliver and evaluate learning activities, demonstrating how your teaching is underpinned by appropriate and current policies and learning theories, and use feedback from peers and your learners to inform your ongoing development priorities.
In year two, the focus shifts to the ways in which you can engage in a meaningful exploration of your teaching practice in order to challenge preconceptions and to take advantage of innovations in education.
Over this year you will focus on proposing and testing hypotheses designed to advance your practice as an arts educator.
In this 30-credit module for all students, you will focus on the development of a practice-based research project that will help you explore new and innovating ways in which you might meet the identified needs of your learners.
In this module you will explore the impact of your new innovative practices through the ethical use of research data and objective critical analysis, informing your ongoing development as an arts educator.
The programme is delivered through a mix of scheduled sessions and one-to-one support.
In each year of study, students will be required to attend 6 days of intensive study, either face-to-face at RCS or through accessing online (for distance learners).
In academic year 25/26, the weekend sessions will be delivered on the following dates:
Online sessions run approximately every second Thursday throughout term time.
These are delivered in the morning between 10am and 12pm, and are repeated between 6.30 and 8.30pm in the evening.
All other tutorial support can be negotiated with personal supervisors, mentors and peers on the programme.
International students can attend weekend sessions remotely for the duration of their studies.
You will need the following codes to apply:
There will be a 30-minute discussion about your application with the Head of Programme and a member of the delivery team.
This will be normally be communicated to within two to three weeks of your interview.
Applicants for the programme normally have a good degree, or international equivalent in a subject area relevant to the demands of the programme.
In some cases, applicants to the programme may already have achieved academic credit on another programme/module of study and are seeking to reduce the number of modules they will need to study on the Programme.
Applications for APL will normally be decided prior to the applicant’s admission to the Conservatoire.
The staff team will use the applicant’s previous transcript and module information to attempt to match the existing credit against modules in the programme.
Staff must identify a match between the level, the learning outcomes and volume of credit associated with the unit/module passed by the applicant and the corresponding Conservatoire module.
APL will not normally be awarded for students who are seeking HEA Fellowship status, however, module credit from another AdvanceHE accredited programme may be considered if the content is deemed a suitable match.
Per 30 credits:
This course can be studied fully online if you live further afield and don’t wish to relocate .
For any students who would like to move to Glasgow to pursue hybrid learning on the programme, it is estimated that you will need between £11,200 and £15,300 per year to live here, though much will depend on your lifestyle.

Yes, you can.
When you reach the payment part of your booking form there are different payment options.
We do request that all course fees are paid in full before the end date of your course.
Full – paying the course in full at the time of booking.
By Term – paying the course in three instalments, one for each term (only available for full year courses)
Monthly – this will split the course cost over the remaining months until your course completion date.
Please note these options will depend on how much time there is between the booking date and end of the course.

Please note the options are from the 1st to the- 28th of each month and if you change it to a date beyond the course end date your payments might increase.
This is because payment for courses must be complete by the last class.
e.g.
– your course finished on the 18th April.
You currently pay your fees on the 10th of each month, so you are due to complete your payment for the course on the 10th April.
You change it until the 28th of each month.
Your instalments will increase to ensure you have paid for the course by 28th March, as the course will already be complete by the 28th April.

Our online courses are delivered through Microsoft Teams and Zoom .
You can read about each of these platforms on their webpages.
We advised that all bookers download the desktop versions of the applications for easy access.
Microsoft Teams is a virtual classroom.
Your Team is your RCS course and will be comprised of the other students on the course, your tutor, and Short Courses staff.
We use Microsoft Teams in two different ways:
Online Classes
Online classes all have a Microsoft Teams page for the class and tutor to share materials.
Students are required to have access to this page and cannot do the course without it.
The Teams page will be updated with the Zoom codes prior to each session, and course materials will be posted throughout classes.
In-Person Classes
We ask all our in-person classes for an email address to add to Teams in case the course tutor should wish to set up a Teams page to share information and materials.
Not all in-person courses have a Teams page, but we keep the information in case it should be required.
During your application you will be asked to select an email address to use when/if we add you to the course Teams group.
Microsoft Teams gets upset by switching emails on a device – so if you already have an account registered for Teams, you should enter that email to avoid confusion.
If you are booking the course for someone else, you should ask them what email they use to access Teams, as only the participant will have access to the Team.
Teams is used by many schools across the UK – so if your child has been accessing Teams for school work, they should use the email already associated with that account – usually their school email address.
Some schools or workplaces do not allow accounts to be used for outside activities, please check, and email us if you wish to change the email address for Teams.
Our online class are delivered through Teams and Zoom, and we require bookers to have access to both these platforms to participate.
On Teams you will be able to view materials the tutor has posted, ask questions, upload any tasks the tutor has set, and access the Zoom codes for each class.
Your Teams account is linked to the email address you supplied in that section of the booking form.
To read more about setting up your Teams, please see below.
Before the course, you will be sent an invite to your Team to the email address you supplied in your booking form.
If you have never used Teams before:
If you have already downloaded the app, a pop up will appear on the screen and you can click Open Microsoft Teams .
Short Courses and Credit-Rated Short Courses students do not have an RCS email account.
If you are asked to select the type of Teams you will be using, please click Personal.
You will find the codes in the Zoom Codes channel of Teams.
You will see it on the left-hand side of your screen, and by clicking on that Channel you’ll see where the Tutor has posted the Zoom code and password for the session.
Please note that the Zoom codes are different for each week.
In order to keep all our customers safe online, we require bookers to log into Teams to access the codes.
This limits the amount of people who will see the codes and stops them getting forwarded via email.
For this reason, we cannot send you the Zoom codes via email.
Once you have been sent the Welcome Information, you will be added to the Teams group.
You will receive an automated message from Microsoft Teams notifying you of this.
We will aim to send this information out 1 to 2 weeks ahead of the course start date.
If you have received your Welcome Information, you should have received your Teams invite.
Please check your Junk Mail before emailing us.
Remember that the Teams invite will go to the email address you entered for Teams – this may be different to the email address you have listed for communication from us.
If you have not received an email, it may be due to an error in the email provided to us.
Sometimes Microsoft Teams can get confused.
Please sign out and sign back in by clicking your initials at the top right-hand corner.
Try clicking the Open Microsoft Teams in the invitation email again.
Try logging in via the Microsoft Teams website.
If you are unsuccessful, please email shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk with screenshots and we will endeavour to help you
You will have access to the Team for up to a week after the course ends.
On the day of the final class, we ask that you download any materials and save any links you wish to keep from the Team.
One week after the course, we will remove all members from the Team and delete it.
You can either upload a file by posting a message in the General Channel, or you can upload it to the Files section, by clicking the Files button at the top.
You need to wait until the full file is uploaded.
For video files this can take a number of minutes.
You need to keep the Teams page up while your file uploads.
You will see a green line crossing the bottom of the File – only once that has completed is the file fully uploaded – and then you are ready to hit post.
Remember to check your file works once it has been uploaded.
Please note that anything you upload to Teams can be seen by your classmates – this is great as it offers the opportunity for peer review as you would in a usual classroom setting.
If you would rather send something directly to the tutor, you can email it to shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk and we will pass it along.
Your RCS Course Team is an invite-only group.
The only people who have access to the Team are the participants, the tutors, and the Short Courses staff.
Please be aware that anything you put on Teams – much like the rest of the internet – can be accessed by other members of the Team.
If you are uploading a video for feedback from the group, this can be downloaded by other members.
We kindly ask students to only download RCS materials and not those uploaded by classmates.
Your classmates will only see your username on Teams.
Many of our classes choose to set up Whatsapp groups or share emails to stay connected outside class times – however this is up to the booker if they choose to share that information.
If you are copy and pasting the password, please remember not to include spaces either side.
It is best to type the password in manually if you are in doubt.
Remember to check that you are entering the password for the correct date.
Each week there is a new Zoom code and password.
If you are using the Zoom link the URL should be hyperlinked.
This means that the Zoom link will be underlined and in a different colour.
For example: https://zoom.us/ .
If it is in the same colour as the general text, and isn’t underlined – https://zoom.us/ – it has not been hyperlinked.
You need to copy and paste it into your internet browser.
To do this highlight the text – and right click, click copy.
Open your browser, go to the search bar, right click, hit paste.
This helps ensure the privacy of the code and makes the link more secure.
Please check that you have the most up to date code.
If you are struggling, please ask for help by posting a message on your Teams page or emailing shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk.
We have found that our online courses work best when you have a screen big enough to see the whole class at once, and the ability to see any shared screens clearly.
This generally means that a phone is too small, some tablets might be suitable, but for best participant experience you should use a laptop or desktop computer.
Please ask your tutor before you download any materials.
Any materials downloaded should not be shared without the permission of the tutor.
We kindly ask that you do not download the work of other students without their permission.
No – as part of our Online Teaching Policy which you agreed to in your booking form, we specify that all performances are for the eyes of the class and their families/friends only.
Much like a live ticketed, performance – only those on the day are able to see the work.
This is to respect participants who do not want their image, work, and name shared without their permission.
All our classes are live, and you must participate in real time.
We do not record classes, and although there may be tasks to complete off screen/between classes – all our teaching is live.
Yes, although all our classes are live and in the GMT zone.
Please check when the course takes place in your time zone before completing your booking.
No.
Due to GDPR we do not record our classes.
If you are going to miss a class, you can ask classmates to recap the class on the Teams page for you.
You should also read through the Teams page to see any tasks that have been set, and/or materials from that lesson.
If you are attending a Drama course, you will need enough space to lie flat on the floor uninterrupted.
This space allows for any breathing exercises or movement work you might participate in.
Dance courses will require more space.
Film and Production courses are generally desk based.
Music courses will require a suitable space for playing your instrument/singing.
We ask students to be aware of their surroundings – make sure there are no trip hazards, and that you are able to take part in any physical activity safely.
Additionally, be aware that your background can be seen by the rest of the class – so be sure to hide any personal items you don’t want other to see.
This depends on your course.
As our classes are live, you are encouraged to participate in conversations much like in person classes.
This shouldn’t be louder than an everyday phone conversation.
If your course involves any acting, singing or playing musical instruments, then you will be making more noise.
Generally, no.
All our classes require you to have a device with a working webcam and microphone, and with internet speeds high enough that you can participate in class.
You should also download the Zoom and Microsoft Teams applications where possible.
Beyond that, you should have a device capable of recording videos (with audio) and taking pictures.
A smart phone is usually sufficient for these tasks.
Please check the Course Preparation tab of your course webpage.
If there is no course preparation tab, then there is generally nothing to prepare.
We will also include any course preparation in our Welcome Information email – so make sure to read it thoroughly.
If you go to your course web page you will see the course name states ‘online’ or ‘in-person’.
Additionally, if your course is in-person it will have the Renfrew Street address listed as the venue.
We currently only have accommodation options for Summer Schools students.
We are pleased to welcome students from across the world to our Summer Schools.
Our course fees do not include accommodation or food, and these should be organised by the student.
Our campus is located in Glasgow city centre, and you can find the addresses below.
We recommend Base Glasgow, as purpose-built accommodation for Conservatoire students, with Rehearsal Rooms, Practice spaces and Dance Studios.
Base Glasgow is perfectly suited for our summer school students; both safe and secure, with 24/7 staff presence and only 3 mins walk from our main Renfrew Street building, keeping travel costs to a minimum.
Classic En-Suite rooms come with a 3/4 bed, en-suite bathroom, ample storage, mirror, study desk and chair.
The shared area includes a spacious lounge and kitchen area.
Please note that Short Courses staff are not affiliated with BASE or on site outwith the summer school teaching hours, and therefore cannot take responsibility for students outside of these hours.
For more information about booking accommodation at BASE Glasgow you can contact them directly via website BASE – Student Accommodation in Glasgow or email baseglasgow@herestudents.com .
Alternatively, there are plenty of hotels, hostels, and b’n’b options available.
We are located close to transport links should you wish to stay outside the city centre.
If you are travelling to Glasgow for a course, we strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance that covers course fees, travel, accommodation, and cancellations due to COVID-19 – as RCS will not refund in this circumstance.
You can view the Cancellations and Refund policy for full information.
For students under 18 years old, we strongly advise travelling with a responsible adult should any emergency situations arise during class.
Students are only monitored by staff during class times.
Renfrew Street Campus: 100 Renfrew Street, Glasgow, G2 3DB Wallace Studios Campus: 210 Garscube Road, Glasgow, G4 9RR
At the beginning of each class, staff and tutors gather all primary age students and escort them to their room through the secure KABA doors, as well as bringing them back to the collection point at the end of each class to ensure they are safely collected by a parent or guardian.
Staff will provide secondary and adult students with access through the secure doors prior to the class start time, and they are not required to be collected by an adult at the end of the class.
You will be provided with details about where and when to gather in your Welcome Information.
The building has a café/bar located on the first floor, which is open to all visitors.
Our Renfrew Street campus is ideally located in the city centre, which provide easy access to other amenities while you wait.
The Renfrew Street Campus is a public building, however only those with allocated access are permitted to enter certain areas of the building.
This includes going beyond our secure KABA doors which lead to studios and classrooms.
This is for the safety of everyone in the building, and we ask that parents and guardians do not attempt to enter these areas.
We always have Short Courses staff on hand to allow for young people to gain access to their classroom during class times.
If you are an adult or secondary school student, please report to the Short Courses office (to the right of the Client Services desk at the ground floor entrance) to be in contact with a member of staff before going to class.
We ask that all absences or latecomers send an email to shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk ahead of time to allow for our team to absence monitor accordingly.
As part of our Child Protection Policy, we operate an absence monitoring system, which means that if we have not had contact to authorise an absence for a young person under the age of 18, a text message will be sent to the contact number provided to confirm their absence.
Although there are no restrictions surrounding COVID-19 guidelines now, we do ask that if you test positive that you do not attend class and try to stay at home as a way to prevent the virus spreading to others.
We care for our students and want to make sure we have all the information needed to assist you should you require medical attention in class.
Once you list your medical information in the booking form, a member of our team will be in contact to check if we can put any additional support in place for you during class.
Please email shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk to notify us of an absence.
You should do this as early as possible so we can assure our administrative staff have updated the registers and made the tutor aware so they can adjust their lesson plans, as necessary.
Please do not private message your tutor or other Short Courses staff on Teams (or email) to notify them of the absence.
Most of our staff work varying hours and we cannot guarantee that the person you are messaging will be available to pick up the message in time.
Emailing shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk assures that your message will be picked up by staff who are working.
We want our classes to run as smoothly as possible.
By telling our staff if you are going to be absent or late, you are ensuring the class can start promptly.
If you are regularly late or have multiple absences, it interferes with the work that your tutor and class are working towards and knowing ahead of time, means that the tutor can plan accordingly.
Being aware of absences also stops tutors wondering if you are late, or not coming, and means that Short Courses staff won’t send an unnecessary absence text or tag you on Teams or email you.
Our online classes are designed to be participated in live.
It is important that our students are able to engage with each other and the tutor.
We completely understand that online learning is difficult for some students.
If you suffer from mental health conditions, or a medical condition that causes anxiety, you should mention this in your Medical Information, and can privately message the tutor on Zoom to let them know that you will be sitting with your camera off.
If you need to step away from your screen, or suddenly leave the Zoom – please email shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk so, we know that you will no longer be attending that session.
If you miss a class, you can ask for a recap from your classmates.
If your class has a Teams page, you should read through it when you are able to as you will be able to see any tasks or materials that were posted during the last session.
Due to our online teaching policy, we are unable to record our sessions.
If it is an in-person course which does not have a Teams page, you can contact us on shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk and we will ask the tutor for some feedback.
Tutors may provide resources which the Short Courses team with share via email.
However, our tutors work part-time and may not be able to provide information before the next class.
Classes that are missed by students are not eligible for a refund.
If you have been asked to appear on screen at the start of each class, it is because your child is aged 13 or under.
Our Online Teaching Policy – which you agree to in our booking form – specifies that in order to safeguard young people learning online, our tutors must see a parent for a quick wave at the start of class – don’t worry, you won’t be asked to participate, and it only takes a second!
Parents/Carers of children in our Drama (ages 3-4) class are required to wait outside the room during class time to assist with any toileting or behavioural issues.
Parents/Carers of children in our Primary 1-7 classes are not required to wait in the building throughout, however we do ask that you are contactable in case we need to get in touch.
Additionally, you are required to drop off and pick up your child at the start and end of class times in the designated area.
Parents/Carers of young people in our Secondary 1-6 classes are not required to attend pick up or drop off after the first week, as students are able to leave the building at break times and at end of class.
We take the safety or all our students very seriously, and as part of our commitment to our child protection policy, we ask that there is a responsible adult at the drop off/collection point to collect any young person taking part in a primary age class (under the age of 12).
As we are located in the busy city centre of Glasgow, we want to ensure that every young person arrives and leaves us safely.
All tutors and workshop assistants work for us on a part-time capacity and have full schedules with us throughout the day.
We ask that parents and guardians do not approach tutors directly, but please speak to a member of the Short Courses team either by contacting shortcourses@rcs.ac.uk or asking for the Duty Manager at the sign in desk.
We aim to treat all queries with confidentiality and will only discuss matters with staff on a need to know basis and at the discretion of the parent/guardian and young person.

BSL Translation of this page
Short Courses Bursaries and Scholarships offer partial financial support, covering a percentage of course fees rather than the full amount.
This assistance is available for one course per student in each academic year*.
If you require financial support for more than one course in an academic year, we encourage students to reapply for additional course support which will be reviewed by the panel, however, we cannot guarantee that support will be granted for multiple courses.
Students should sign up for their chosen course before completing a financial support application, as we cannot guarantee that a space will be available on the course.
Students are encouraged to apply early, as funding is limited and awarded based on specific eligibility criteria.
Please find an overview of the financial support options available below.
You can find out more about each scholarship/bursary, including eligibility criteria and how to apply, on each of the dropdowns later on this page.
*Academic year refers to short courses running between September and August each year (e.g.
September 2025 – August 2026 is the 2025/2026 academic year)
Agnes Allan was a teacher who was passionate about social inclusion and the bursary scheme exists to offer support to our students to participate in Short Courses weekly classes, short study weekends, credit-rated short courses and summer schools.
Any student who can demonstrate the need for financial support within our criteria which will allow them to enrol in a Short Course is entitled to apply.

Our Access Courses are a great way to help you take the next step towards undergraduate study.
At RCS we have many students who have had interesting journeys to their final course of study.
Read more about them here:
BA Acting
Israela auditioned for RCS straight from school but found she needed more experience first.
She took a bold, brave and proactive decision to study NC and HNC Acting and Performance at Glasgow Clyde College.
College provided Israela with an excellent bridge into RCS, enabling her to build confidence, flourish and fly.
She says: ‘ If you feel different, use it to your advantage.
I was born and raised in Scotland but I’m also Congolese, so I went to my RCS audition thinking ‘they need a Scongolese actress… ’ and it turned out they did.
BA Production Arts & Design, Scenic Construction
David had no clear pathway.
After university he worked in catering, retail, taught English as a Foreign Language, learnt carpentry and fitted up his kitchen before discovering BA Production.
He says, ‘ This industry really values and rewards people skills.
You’ve ticked so many personal development boxes just by having that life experience .’ For his second degree, David paid his course fees by working a part time job and says whilst it’s challenging, ‘It’s gonna change your life.
I’ve never doubted I’m in the right place .’
BA Production Technology & Management, Stage Management
Connor was supported to develop confidence and practical experience via our RCS Fair Access and Junior Conservatoire programmes.
He tells us: ‘ Fair Access brought me into a place where I felt comfortable in my own craft and could move forward ’.
At the same time, he studied HNC Technical Theatre at West College Scotland.
This gave him the chance he’d been looking for to help him explore, develop and build a range of specialist skills through practical study before getting a place at RCS.
BA Musical Theatre
For Cerys, further education opened a door.
She says: ‘ Having a disability such as Tourette’s and managing other medical conditions, I didn’t think it was a possibility for me to do musical theatre or to progress as a career .’ But HNC Musical Theatre at Fife College together with RCS Fair Access gave Cerys the steppingstone she needed.
Now in her second year at RCS, a support plan and accommodations have helped Cerys navigate her training and feel confident to take on the industry.
BA Production Technology and Management
Sean started in musical theatre but now studies sound engineering.
He got into stage management, explored lighting and sound, did HNC Technical Theatre at West College Scotland and became Technical Tutor at his theatre school.
Set on his path, Sean also found work with theatres, festivals and hire companies from Aberdeen to London.
He says: ‘ Having an acting background, being multi-disciplinary within the performing arts, working in freelance theatre and teaching gave me a broad spectrum of different experiences.
And I talked about it ALL at my RCS interview.
’
BMus Composition
Charlotte is a BMus Composition student.
Being a drummer meant that Charlotte took a less conventional route into studying composition.
This allowed her to thrive in what some might consider the more traditional and classical art of composition.
Drumming has enabled Charlotte to champion her unique identity within her work.
She says: ‘ Drumming has given me a very unique identity within this space, and I’ve never grown away from that.
Instead, I’ve completely immersed myself in a classical culture, but I’ve never let it take me, I’ve always been inspired by it ’
Emily was a dedicated player from an early age.
Supported by Fair Access, Emily studied classical and jazz trumpet.
But after receiving Distinction for Grade eight, Emily lost the desire to play.
Rekindling their creative zest (and later, their love for the trumpet) Emily found their niche in BMus Composition.
Passionate about taking opportunities, Emily says:
‘ It’s important to explore other pathways in case something’s waiting for you, because it’s probably on a cherry tree to your right, you just need to turn around and look…there’s not just one cherry tree it’s a garden, with an apple tree and an orange tree .’
BEd (Music)
Ellie is BEd Music student.
She has a background in being a drummer and this has fueled her approach to her teaching career.
Ellie’s experience of being a female drummer, in what is often seen as a male dominated artform, has driven her determination to diversify the music world.
It has also informed her chosen pathway to support young musicians in studying whatever instrument they develop a passion for.
She says: ‘ Everyone talks about diversifying the music world, and that’s not gonna happen unless we start in the schools and trickle it down ’

New sentences found on https://rcs.ac.uk/courses/traditional-music-graded-exams:
Are you a music teacher with students interested in Scottish music?
Are you a student looking to take an exam conducted by an experienced performer in your discipline?
Our Traditional Music Graded Exams promote traditional Scottish performance skills and the best of traditional and contemporary repertoire by the establishment of a specialist, performance-based series of assessments true to the artistic integrity of Scotland’s musical heritage.
Working in consultation with the Conservatoire’s Scottish Music staff and specialists from across Scotland, the programme acknowledges the value of Scotland’s traditional music to its contemporary culture and identity and seeks further to strengthen traditional music’s ties to education and lifelong learning.
Unlike other music exam programmes, the Scottish Traditional Music Graded Exams are specialist-based – meaning a fiddle candidate is assessed by a fiddle examiner, an accordion candidate by an accordion examiner, and so on.
As is often the case with traditional music students and players, improvisation and ‘having a good ear’ are often more present than an ability to read classical notation.
As such, candidates do not have to read music to take the exams: our syllabuses offer the choice between reading music for assessment or playing back by ear.
As a tool for tutors and learners of all ages and abilities comparable in its grading to classical music exams, the programme provides:
However, the exams and assessments can also be fun:
“There was a really relaxed atmosphere in the waiting room while the accordion exams were taking place.
Everyone, both candidates and parents, were very supportive of each other, applauding once candidates had finished practising.
A few of the candidates even had a wee jamming session between practising!
It was an enjoyable day for all involved.” — Steward, Aberdeen centre
Deadline for booking June exams: 2 June 2025
Exam fees: see Booking Information
Current repertoire valid until: December 2025
Working together with a range of Scotland’s foremost traditional musicians and tutors, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is pleased to announce our syllabuses for fiddle, harp and accordions are available direct from our website in the dropdown below .
These include new selections of tunes in addition to timeless favourites – a wider range of practice specimens for Quick Studies and PAM tests.
The repertoire for each syllabus is now valid until December 2025.
You can purchase Scottish Music Graded Exam books from our Shop
Graded exams up to Grade 5 feature the performance of a wide diversity of traditional and modern tunes, brief technical work, a ‘quick study’ and a series of practical and aural musicianship (PAM) tests designed specifically with the Scottish traditional musician in mind.
There are no theory tests.
In ungraded performance assessments, there are no marks and no pass or fail: just expert independent feedback on your playing, written by the examiner on the certificate that the candidate receives at the end of each assessment.
It is suitable for adult learners, teachers and candidates of any age with specific needs.
It’s also perfect for young learners who’d simply like a relaxed and supportive introduction to the exam experience.
Two exam sessions take place annually on Royal Conservatoire premises: a Spring/Summer session and an Autumn/Winter session.
The Spring/Summer session usually takes place in March; the session in Autumn/Winter usually in November.
Once the deadline for entries to a session has passed, our Graded Exams Administrator collates the entries and notifies each applicant of their candidates’ appointment with the examiner for the upcoming session.
If, however, you are not within easy travelling distance of Glasgow or have a group of candidates ready for exams at other times of the year, you can request a special visit by an examiner near you.
Certain conditions apply, but we are always happy to discuss your needs and accommodate them whenever possible.
The examiner is a specialist in the candidate’s instrument and is eager to make the exam a welcoming and enjoyable experience.
The exam takes 15- 20 minutes, depending on the grade; and in line with other examination boards, the applicant will receive a detailed mark sheet, an official certificate to pass on to the candidate(s), and our sincere thanks for your participation within 4-6 weeks of the exam session taking place.
We are planning to run exams in June and November 2025.
You can book the next round of exams by following the links below:
Accordion: 25 June 2025 – Online Only – Booking now closed.

Schools and private tutors not within easy travelling distance of Glasgow can book special visits by an examiner for at least a day’s worth of candidates (i.e.
12 or more).
How to book a Special Visit
The administrator will send an exam timetable to the person requesting the exam and the examiner.
Please note: we prefer to liaise with only one applicant per Special Visit, so that person must take responsibility for distributing timetable information amongst other tutors/parents.
If any candidate’s fee has not been received as of one week prior to the Special Visit, that candidate will be removed from the timetable, and this may endanger the viability of the entire visit.
Like exams delivered by the Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music, the Conservatoire’s Scottish Traditional Music Graded Exams are divided into four sections and last 15-20 minutes depending on the grade.
Total possible marks in each Scottish Traditional Music Graded Exam are 150.
100 marks are required to reach a Pass; 120 marks to pass with Merit; and 130 marks to pass with Distinction.
The four sections of the exam are:
Performance (90 marks)
The performance part of the exam has 3 pieces: 1) Airs, 2) Dance Tunes and 3) Recently-composed Tunes.
Each piece is marked out of 30.
Please see specific instrument guidelines below.
Technical Work (18 marks)
Technical work for Scottish Traditional Music Graded Exams will include a limited number of scales, arpeggios and technical exercises, depending on the syllabus.
Quick Study (21 marks)
This section, in which you are to play back a short piece of music, can be done by ear or by sight the choice is yours.
See Quick Study Guidelines for further details.
Practical and Aural Musicianship (21 marks)
Practical and Aural Musicianship (PAM) comprises a short series of tests designed to encourage your understanding of traditional rhythms and tune idioms, and challenge your ability to echo and improvise responses to musical prompts.
Please see PAM Guidelines for more details.
Remember the exam is meant to be an enjoyable and rewarding experience, and the examiner will do his or her best to put you at ease.
Good luck!
The current repertoire for Traditional Music Graded Exams is valid until December 2025.

Question?
If you have any questions about the Junior Conservatoire or the application process, please don’t hesitate to contact us at juniorsstageandscreen@rcs.ac.uk
At the audition, we are looking to identify pathways for you towards your aspirations to develop your abilities in Acting.
This may be through Junior Conservatoire, or through Short Courses at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
Dates: Acting auditions will be held w/c 30th March 2026
We aim for all our auditions to be in person at one of the campuses of The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
The auditions consist of two parts: a group workshop, a solo audition where you perform your prepared speech and have an interview with the panel.
Group Workshop:
Participants will participate in a 1 hour workshop.
This consists of a range of games and creative tasks that use your skills in improvisation, collaboration, and connecting the activities to learning points in the artform.
In this part of the audition, we are looking at your ability to work creatively and generously with others, share and listen to ideas, and articulate how what we are doing together links to Acting.
Solo Audition:
Your Monologue:
A few weeks before your audition date, we will send you a selection of about 20 speeches to choose from.
Full instructions will be provided with the workbook.
Please select one of the speeches we send you and prepare it for performance in the audition when you meet with us.
We want you to perform this without the script, and present it as if you were performing it for an audience.
We will also ask you why you selected the speech.
As you perform your monologue, we will be looking to see how you use your voice and body as the character to get what they want from the people they are talking to.
We will be able to see the choices you’ve made and it will give us an insight into your current skillset and where we can support you further.
Your Redirection:
We will ask to see the speech in a completely different way.
This is because we want to see how you work quickly, creatively, and boldly.
Sometimes this redirection will make things trickier for you as it might feel a bit unnatural, or sometimes it will help make things easier for you as an actor.
We will want to hear your reflection on how the redirection changed things for you.
Your Interview:
This is an opportunity for you to discuss what you love about acting, your ambitions, and what you think you need to become a better actor.
We are just as passionate about performance as you, so feel free to ask us questions too.
Throughout the interview we will be getting a sense of what we think you need to develop, what you already do, how committed to drama you are, and whether you have the stamina, drive, and passion yet to train intensely at Junior Conservatoire each week.
Hear from some of our Student Ambassadors about what studying Acting is like here at the Junior Conservatoire!
Acting 4
Grace is 18 and from Glasgow.
Why did you decide to audition for Juniors?
I really enjoyed learning at RCS through doing short courses when I was younger and wanted to progress to the next level.
My audition was via self tape and then an online redirect and interview.
The panel were very welcoming and made my audition feel informal and relaxed.
I felt so excited to find out that I had been offered a place.
Starting Juniors gave me something big to look forward to at the end of every week.
What do you look forward to most on a Sunday?
I look forward to seeing my friends who travel from all over the UK to go to Juniors.
I look forward to discovering new things about acting and just being in such a creative space with such welcoming people.
The atmosphere at Juniors is amazing.
I have never walked past someone in the corridor without them smiling back.
Everyone at Juniors is so passionate about what they do and that lights up the space.
Why should young people apply for Juniors?
We are so lucky as young people to have an opportunity like Juniors.
You should apply if you are a young person who is passionate about perusing a career in the industry.
Juniors helps young people with all levels of experience to discover who they are as people and performers.
Juniors will help you to connect with people who share your passion.
It will also encourage you to work with people who study other art forms at Bridge Week or during collaboration modules.
Juniors has helped me to believe in myself and gain confidence when in auditions, when working on external projects and even outside of acting.
Acting 3
Solomon is 16 and from Glasgow.
I was looking for something more professional, and for something to challenge me.
Auditioning was a great experience; I felt supported and loved how the panel made me feel relaxed and calm.
I was so happy when I received my offer.
When I first started I was super nervous and didn’t really know what to expect but after the first week I couldn’t wait for the next one.
Seeing all the friends I’ve made.
Juniors has an environment like no other.
The level of teaching is of a very high standard and quality compared to other theatre schools.
Everyone is like-minded and I think that we all motivate each other in a sense where we learn from not only the lecturer but from our peers too.
Being able to learn in the actual university buildings makes it so much better as it brings such a good work ethic.
My self-confidence has extremely improved, I used to doubt myself a lot and now I don’t.
I also watch so much more plays and films now as teachers and peers will give recommendations.
Amy is 18 and is from Linlithgow.
I wanted to take Acting more seriously and develop the passion I had found for it, as my only experience prior to Juniors was Musical Theatre based.
The training at Juniors gave me a chance to explore opportunities unlike any I had before, whilst giving me a chance to learn in an incredibly collaborative, supportive and professional environment.
It gives you a chance to learn hands-on with other like-minded, creative students and tutors.
I took part in a short group workshop with other applicants and the panel, allowing us to warm-up and just enjoy the day.
I then presented a monologue of my choice to the panel, which was made relaxing and supportive as I was able to choose from a short booklet sent to me.
The panel were incredibly kind and welcoming, and redirected the monologue with me.
It felt amazing to receive an offer, I couldn’t believe it and was so excited!
Everyone made me feel so welcomed on my first day as I was a wee bit nervous about going into a class that had already done Level 1 together.
But it felt as if I had found all of these people just like me and we all shared the same passion.
The people!
Everyone is so nice and easy to work with.
The tutors are amazing, giving you a chance to really learn loads.
The atmosphere at Juniors is just buzzing!
Everyone is so excited to be here from all the disciplines and there is just so much joy throughout the building.
Because you will learn so much about yourself and make so many amazing memories.
I feel much more confident as a person and feel I know much more about myself.
I feel more open to trying new things and meeting new people.
Jude is 17 and is from Irvine.
I decided to audition for Juniors as I knew of RCS as a drama school and how amazing it was, so the fact they had a Juniors programme I could be a part of really excited me.
My audition experience for Juniors was nerve-wracking but also amazing.
I found that you could really tell that all the panel wanted you to do well, which was very inspiring as I felt believed in as soon as I walked in the room to audition.
I felt super excited to be offered a place as I knew I was going to progress so much as an actor in Juniors.
I look forward to learning new skills and things that I can apply to myself as an actor.
I am also always excited to see all my friends at Juniors.
The atmosphere is so chill and relaxing on a Sunday, but there is also a surge of energy and creativity.
You should apply to Juniors because you will learn so much, meet some friends for life and have an amazing time doing so.
My confidence in myself and my ability as an actor have sky rocketed since I joined Juniors.
Harley is 17 and is from Saltcoats.
One of the lecturers, Lydia, came along to my school for a chat and workshop regarding Juniors, as soon as I knew what it was about I was hooked!
I wanted to be somewhere I grow and expand my skills with ease.
At the audition, at first I was nervous, but as soon as I met the other people and we all realised everyone else felt the same, it became a lot more chilled out as we felt comfort in each other.
I made sure to tell my mum that if she got an email regarding my place I had to read it first, and I am so glad I did because I smiled from ear to ear when I got in.
At first, when I started I was bricking it, it was scary, but then someone from my audition also got in so I recognised someone, after that it felt much easier to connect with others!
It’s the perfect way to end a week, you get to learn really intriguing and interesting stuff, all while hanging out with your mates!
The atmosphere is joyous, everyone wants to be there.
Also it’s trusting; we all share a connection that we built trust from, so there’s no nerves at all.
You will not regret it, at Juniors you can be free to take risks, face new challenges and explore many areas of the creative industry, all under one roof and in a trusting and safe environment.
Being able to take risks while performing was such a no go zone for me, but then when I could do that in the right space, it became second nature elsewhere.
I also learned that to make a connection you don’t need to speak to someone, it could just be a few seconds glance on the train or a whole staring contest for a few minutes, out of this comes a connection!
Isabella is 16 and is from Glasgow.
As someone who was really interested in filmmaking I wanted to learn more about acting so I could understand the process more.
As a kid, I always liked acting but never did it for long periods of time so I wanted to see what I was capable of.
The audition process was all very welcoming.
It started with a group round which I loved because I got to meet everyone and work with them which is one of my favourite parts of acting.
Then we went into solo auditions which is where we had to perform our monologues.
I liked the auditions because it was fun yet really professional.
It made me feel like I was auditioning for something really high profile.
I felt like I had actually achieved something when I got in.
When we first started we were in movement which completely challenged me as it was something I had never done before.
I found it really fascinating and learned so much and loved the fact I was in a completely new environment.
I look forward to doing something new every week.
Each week at Juniors teaches you something new and I look forward to discovering a new aspect of the process.
It’s a really happy atmosphere because we all love each other and love what we do.
If you have any interest in the creative industry, acting is a brilliant way to understand people more.
You can escape through characters and have a brilliant rush of adrenaline every week.
The community of people that forms is so special and will stay with you for the rest of time.
Apply to Juniors if you like people and connection!
Caoimhe is 15 and is from Bo’ness.
I was lucky to get professional acting opportunities at a young age and some of the actors from the projects I worked on were RCS alumni.
This inspired me to find out more about RCS and I discovered their Juniors Drama courses.
It felt like the perfect place for me to get the best training to build on my experience and develop my performance skills.
In 2021, Juniors reduced the entrance age from 14 to 12 so I was excited to be able to audition sooner than I had thought.
It was during Covid so I had to perform and be interviewed via Zoom which felt harder than face-to-face.
It wasn’t as nerve-wracking as I thought it was going to be as the audition panel were very friendly and encouraging which made me feel at ease.
I was excited to receive 2 offers: one for Acting and one for Musical Theatre, but had a difficult choice to make.
The panel took the time to give me additional support and feedback to help me with my decision.
When I started, it was quite strange as my first few weeks were via Zoom due to Covid.
It felt harder not being face-to-face but I still really enjoyed the classes and loved meeting everyone even if it wasn’t in-person to start with.
On Sundays I look forward most to seeing everyone in my class.
We all learn so much together and from each other.
The atmosphere on a Sunday is really supportive and the great thing is that because all of us share a love for performing we are all having as much fun as each other.
There is no better place than RCS Juniors to nurture and develop your skills, confidence and passion in your chosen discipline.
You will experience amazing performance opportunities and make memories with the best people that will last a lifetime.
It really is like nowhere else.
I have grown so much as a person in my time at Juniors.
I will graduate this year with more confidence, self belief and a deeper understanding of myself!
Alannah is 17 and is from Johnstone.
I feel the tuition here is second to none, and getting advice and guidance from industry professionals who have experienced the challenges we are yet to face is so, so important and rare to come by!
The audition process was super chill, totally low pressure.
We did a few group exercises to break the ice and get everybody talking, familiarising ourselves with the audition space and bringing everyone together.
It was really fun!
I was delighted to be offered a place.
I was quite nervous on my first day as I had joined later and was scared that everyone would already have established their own friend groups, however all my classmates were so welcoming and open.
It’s such a great environment to work in.
I look forward to getting into really in-depth discussions about texts we are analysing.
Looking at the motivations and behaviours of the characters is so interesting, it’s like getting a look at the world from their point of view, no matter who they are or what time period it is set in.
It truly makes some three dimensional work come through.
The tuition is honestly brilliant, and the people here are so kind and well.
You’ll feel straight at home.
It’s pushed me to try new things, to give stuff a go and apply for as many roles as I can.
Experience is imperative!
Hannah is 19 and from Kirkcaldy.
I decided to audition for Juniors as I wanted to continue my training somewhere that offers the highest level of teaching.
I wanted the opportunity to not only grow as a performer but also meet like-minded young people who share the same passion for acting.
My audition was really laid back and welcoming.
I realised quickly that the panel wanted the auditionees to have a fun time rather than it being a daunting experience.
I felt so at ease during the group workshop that by the time it was my own individual audition I felt excited to show the panel what I had been working on.
When I received the email saying I had been offered a place I was really excited.
I couldn’t wait for the term to start and to meet everyone in my course.
The atmosphere of my first day was just as welcoming as my audition.
Despite being one of the few new starts in my level, I felt encouraged to share my ideas and fully immerse myself into the module.
Each Sunday, I look forward to the teaching and participating in each class.
I know every Sunday I am going to learn something new and the teaching is always really fun and exciting.
I also always look forward to seeing everyone in my class, I know I’m going to have a good time.
The atmosphere at Juniors every Sunday is really lively.
The moment you walk through the door you can feel a buzz throughout the building of students going to classes.
You make connections with students across all levels and art forms which means you always have someone to talk to wherever you are which makes the atmosphere so much better.
You should apply for Juniors as you’ll receive such a high level of training you won’t receive anywhere else.
You’ll also make connections and friends that’ll last a lifetime.
The skills I have learnt at Juniors not only benefit me as a performer but it also pays off in my day to day life.
I feel so much more grounded in myself and whenever I’m feeling stressed or uneasy, I can refer back to ways I have learnt at Juniors to check in on myself.

In singing, the number of sessions of Acting Through Song are increased to support students in delivering powerful solo performances.

To gain the knowledge and experience in musical theatre and enhance the skills I already had.
I enjoyed the audition experience – I auditioned online and sent videos of me dancing and singing, then I had a Zoom call with the audition panel where I recited a monologue and then mixed it up a bit and delivered it a different way.
The panel interviewed me then I heard back quite quickly that I had gained a place.

The atmosphere is really easy-going and I don’t feel pressured.

When I got offered a place, I cried!
I was so ecstatic and felt so proud of myself!
It felt like a huge accomplishment; on my first day, I was buzzing and was smiling and giggling the whole day.

We have been teaching the performing arts in Glasgow since 1847.
Building on our roots as a national academy of music, we have grown over the past 175 years to be one of the most interdisciplinary and collaborative institutions in the world and are consistently ranked within the world’s top 10 performing arts institutions ( QS World Rankings ).
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland started life as the Glasgow Athenaeum in 1847, which aimed to “provide a source of mental cultivation, moral improvement and delightful recreation to all classes.” The Athenaeum was formally opened by the author Charles Dickens, who delivered the inaugural address at the first ‘soiree’.
For the first 39 years, the Athenaeum only offered music classes, and, in 1886, drama was introduced to the curriculum.
It was from the Athenaeum’s School of Music that the Scottish National Academy of Music was formed in 1929.
This grew in prestige and, by 1944, its international standing was recognised by King George VI, who approved that the prefix ‘Royal’ be added to the Academy’s title, making it the Royal Scottish Academy of Music .
At that time, the then Queen Elizabeth graciously assumed the role of Patron, a role in which she continued as Queen Mother until her death in 2002.
These exciting developments were not confined to music.
In 1950, the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art was created with the aim of training actors and directors for the professional theatre.
Soon after, the college’s curriculum expanded to include technical courses and, in collaboration with the University of Glasgow, diploma courses with a strong academic element.
In 1962, the college opened the first television studio to be located within a UK drama school evidence of the pioneering spirit still apparent in our institution today.
The title of Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama was approved in 1968, which reflected the happy union of music and drama in a single Academy, dedicated to excellence across the spectrum of the performing arts.
Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, the Academy continued to develop its programme provision and enhance its international reputation.
The first degree courses were introduced, validated by the University of Glasgow.
Then in 1993/94 the Academy became the only UK conservatoire to be awarded its own degree-awarding powers by the Privy Council.
New undergraduate and postgraduate programmes were also added, meeting new and future needs.
We recruited our first research students in 2000/01: another key milestone, particularly because of our radical practice-based approach to research.
In 2011, the institution became the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland — a name change which signified our national status and our growing curriculum, with degrees now offered across the whole performing arts.
This established the Royal Conservatoire’s place as a world-leading conservatoire, with a new collaborative curriculum across music, drama, dance, production and film.
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) is bold, ambitious and optimistic about our future as a twenty-first century conservatoire.
Our goal now, through our students, staff and graduates, is to raise the transformative power and reach of the performing arts in Scotland and beyond.
In 2021, we published ‘Performing Through A Pandemic’, a document that summarises the way in which we responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.
We worked hard to deliver the highest-quality learning and teaching experience possible through a blend of in-person and online activity, as well as working safely and carefully within all health and safety guidelines to offer on-campus ensemble opportunities, rehearsals and performances.

Research activity at RCS is artistically orientated and often practice-based, falling under seven research clusters.
These are:
The largest research cluster at RCS, artistic research explores questions that arise from practice, uses artistic practice as a method, and frequently (though not always) produces results in the form of artistic works.
Within this cluster is a rich programme of New Work and Improvisation in music, dance and theatre-making; artistic research approaches also inform our work in Creative Health, Art-making in the Anthropocene, and much of our Musicology.
RCS researchers helped to draft the Vienna Declaration on Artistic Research.
In this cluster researchers address key questions about humankind’s relationship to the more-than-human world, exploring the role and potential of art-making to open up new understandings of the existential challenges of climate crisis.
Some recent work includes Hopfinger’s performance research exploring the relationships between chronic pain in the body and the ‘trouble’ of ecological pain and Doolittle’s investigations into the relationship between animal songs and human music.
Our researchers explore the impacts of creative approaches and cultural activities on health and wellbeing, innovating and collaborating to orchestrate advances in national and international health and social care systems.
Ongoing work in this cluster includes Whiteside’s work on the impact of participatory dance on neurological conditions, Drury’s work on song-writing in therapeutic settings, and Robertson-Kirkland’s leadership of Scotland’s Singing for Health Network
The study of music takes many forms and RCS academics are highly active within this field, often drawing insights from artistic research approaches.
Researchers in this cluster work on historical musicology – such as Fabrice Fitch’s work on plainsong and medieval polyphony; McAulay and Dickson use historical, ethnomusicological and artistic research approaches to explore the rich and diverse traditions and practices of Scottish music, while other RCS researchers work on 18th, 19th and 20th century European music.
This significant cluster includes artistic research across music, dance and drama, generating artistic outcomes that arise from research questions.
Musical composition is an important aspect of this cluster, with recent work including major music theatre pieces performed across Europe, such as MacRae’s Anthropocene and Fennessy’s Conquest of the Useless ; improvisation, whether acoustic, with live electronics, or livecoded is another key aspect; in the sphere of theatre, new work includes both live performance and digital or mixed media work.
The focus of this research cluster is to apply a wide range of methods to understand and improve education, with work on pedagogy and policy.
Projects include Drury’s work on innovative practices around the rights of children and Moscardini’s work in inclusive education; use of videoconferencing and low-latency technologies for instrumental music teaching; and work on the policy context for performing arts education in Scotland, the wider UK and internationally.
SHARE is an initiative to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between academics at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the University of St Andrews and beyond.

Shared Migrants is a participatory research project exploring the migrant experiences of the ‘Irish border’.
The research is conducted in the context of increased interest in the ‘Irish border’, especially in relation to Brexit, and heightened consideration of migrants in this context – on the island of Ireland, as well as in Scotland.
The border is redefined through the framework of performance studies, from an open, post-conflict ‘Irish border’ to a hard, tightly controlled ‘migrant border’.
The output, in collaboration with Nessa Finnegan, a visual artist and facilitator, will be an innovative physical archive of migrant border performances as a mobile, physical object, contrasting to current digital contributions.
The MacLean-Clephane Manuscripts; Research, Recording and Publication is a project designed to offer novel insights into the enthralling and unpublished Maclean-Clephane manuscripts (1808-1825), which contain a wide selection of Gaelic music and provide examples of genuine early Gaelic harp repertory.
By employing a practice-based approach to explore (re)presentations, musical understandings, interpretations and performative practices of the material, artistic and intellectual research will be united.
New understanding of historically-informed and contemporary performance for harp will be delivered – culminating in audio recordings and written notation of arrangements of 18 pieces from the manuscripts, released as a CD and tune book.
Importantly, the project also illuminates the rare role of women in early collections of traditional music and delves into the living Gaelic culture that surrounded the authors.
Playing music to animals: an interdisciplinary approach to improving our understanding of animals’ responses to music is a collaborative project (with Glasgow University, KU Leuven, and Hochschule für Musik Nürnberg) to research and review existing practises of playing music to animals in farming, research, and domestic contexts, making recommendations for improving both experimental design and ethics.
The work has reach across biology, ethics, music and ecology.
It has huge potential to improve animal welfare, with relevance to workers in the dairy and egg industry, veterinarians, zookeepers, and pet owners, in addition to academic researchers.
Dr Jill Morgan , Co-programme lead MA Psychology in the Arts (Music) , has conducted impactful research into the potential barriers faced by emerging composers in Scotland when seeking to establish and maintain a career in the field of composition.
The research was funded by New Music Scotland and Red Note – both organisations share a commitment to support the development of composers, performers and new music in Scotland and internationally.
Qualitative data was gathered and analysed from early career composers and established professionals, with the aim of providing novel insights and constructive recommendations for future consideration.
The findings illuminate key challenges which include financial instability, gender bias, age and disability discrimination.
Importantly, it identified the need for optimised educational mentoring and greater funding opportunities to underpin the success, sustainability and diversity of professional composers.
The research has been published in the prestigious British Journal of Music Education.

RCS is proud to announce that Dr Fabrice Fitch , Senior Research Fellow and Tutor in Composition, specialising in Renaissance polyphony and its performance, has successfully completed the reconstruction of Jacob Obrecht’s fragmentary Missa Scaramella .
This is a cantus firmus mass cycle based on the famous Italian melody familiar to Renaissance music enthusiasts.
The Mass survives in a set of manuscript partbooks copied a dozen years or so after the composer’s death in 1505, of which only two of the original four have come down to us.
It was first published in its fragmentary state as part of the KVNM’s New Obrecht Edition.
In Dr Fitch’s new edition, the two missing voices have been entirely reconstructed, drawing on elements of musical style, mensural notation, and Obrecht’s extensive output as a composer of Masses.
The result offers a recognisable glimpse of a work that might have been reckoned among Obrecht’s finest, had it survived intact — full of the wit and whimsy, formal mastery, and melodic invention of the composer at the height of his creative powers.
The reconstruction has received considerable critical acclaim, having been featured both in Gramophone and on BBC Radio 3’s Early Music Show .
Reviewing the Binchois Consort’s recording of the work for Hyperion, Gramophone ’s reviewer noted that the reconstruction itself is “built on a close understanding of how Obrecht functioned, and the results, full of the most surprising insights, are thoroughly convincing”, and the performers “at the top of their form”.
The influential critic Alex Ross chose the recording among the fifteen top recordings for 2024.
Following its professional premiere by the Binchois Consort at the Regensburg Early Music Days (May 2024) and Antwerp Laus Polyphoniae Festival (August 2024), there will be further performances in Brussels (2025) and Birmingham (2026).

The Conservatoire’s Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, originating before World War II, was greatly enhanced by the acquisition of the collection of John Webb in 2012 and continues to attract important additions.
Of a total collection of some 500 historic musical instruments, the 420 instruments in the John Webb Collection include 290 brasswinds which constitute a world-renowned collection.
The instruments date almost entirely from the long 19th century, a period of great change in wind instrument design, and thus the collection includes a large proportion of the historically important models of woodwind and especially brasswind.
The combined collection includes a good representation of the instruments used in orchestras, bands, and domestic music-making in this period.
The Collection is particularly strong in British instruments but with significant French, German and Italian examples.
The collection of keyed brass is particularly fine, with many examples of keyed bugles and ophicleides.
The Collection includes many items important in the history of brass instruments, notably including the silver slide trumpet belonging to Thomas Harper Jnr., the Besson valve trumpet of Sir Malcolm Arnold, and several instruments from John Wallace.

In 2011,  RCS repurposed four film and television editing suites at the Renfrew Street campus into archives to house our collections.
We got to work building the collections by first establishing what we still had secreted in forgotten cupboards, down the back of filing cabinets, in the houses of retired staff and deposited in other archives and facilities throughout the city.
Since opening our doors, the service and the collections outgrew their original home in Renfrew Street.
We found new accommodation at Whisky Bond at Speirs Wharf, just up the hill from Wallace Studios.
After packing 960 boxes and wrapping items in more than 2 kilometres of bubble wrap, we moved our archive to its new home.
From the Britannia Panopticon Music Hall Archive to the early film career of Jazz singer Annie Ross, from the original manuscript music composed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and King George VI to an early nineteenth-century glass harmonica made up of tuned musical glasses, our Archives & Collections have something to interest everybody.
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland was founded in 1847 as the Glasgow Athenaeum, and one of the earliest items we have in our collections is the very first visitors’ book dating to October of the opening year.
It would originally have been covered in plush velvet, but the years haven’t been kind to its binding and much of it has now rotted away.
The Book of Strangers, as it was known, is a fascinating record of who visited the institution in its early days.
One of the first signatures that pops out is Charles Dickens, 28 December 1847.
The Glasgow Athenaeum’s Opening Soirée (that’s really what they called it) took place in the City Hall, with the famous author himself chairing events.
His signature has its own page from that day, beautifully preserved in Indian ink.
Other signatures include American renaissance man Ralph Waldo Emerson, who gave two lectures in February 1848, and Glasgow’s famous polymath mathematician, engineer and scientist Lord Kelvin – who was actually born in Belfast.
Anyone visiting the Glasgow Athenaeum who wasn’t either a member or a citizen of Glasgow had to sign the Book of Strangers, and we find names from as far afield as Greenland, New York, Berlin and Paisley.
Emma Ritter-Bondy was a pianist of international renown.
A graduate of the Vienna Conservatory, Emma was born Emma Maria Bondy in Graz in 1838.
After completing her studies in the 1850s under Josef Fischhof, Emma began a successful touring concert career, eventually meeting and marrying the artist Franz Ritter in 1862.
In the late 1860s, the couple moved to Koblenz, where Emma took a teaching post at Königlichen Gymnasium zu Coblenz, today’s Görres-Gymnasium.
Their two children, Ida (born in 1874) and Camillo (born in 1875) both trained as musicians, following in their mother’s footsteps.
In 1891, having lost her husband some years earlier, Emma was appointed Professor of Piano at the fledgling Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, founded one year earlier under the direction of the Greenock-born and Leipzig Conservatorium-educated Allan Macbeth.
It was to be a momentous appointment.
The first woman to be appointed a professor in the UK was previously thought to be Edith Morley, appointed Professor of the English Language at Reading University in 1908.
It was also previously thought that Scotland did not appoint a woman to a professor’s chair until Margaret Fairlie was made Chair of Gynaecology at the University College Dundee (now Queen’s College, Dundee) in 1940.
Although Emma was appointed Professor of Piano in 1891 and appears in the Prospectus as such in that year, our archives have no evidence of her teaching until the following year.
Emma’s diary is an intimate record of an immigrant single mother, simultaneously bringing up a young family and holding down an eminent teaching job in an era when married women were expected to stay at home and no state provision was available to support widows.
Her diary, much of which is written in a now-broken code, was donated to the Archives & Collections by Emma’s great-grandson in 2019.
At the same time that Allan Macbeth was appointing Emma Ritter-Bondy as Professor of Piano, he was also casting his net wide to capture the emerging talent coming out of the most prestigious European schools.
Henri Verbrugghen was a recent graduate of the Brussels Conservatorium, where he studied under famed violin teachers Jenö Hubay and Eugène-Auguste Ysaÿe.
A more or less stellar career immediately followed his graduation, including leading the Scottish Orchestra (forerunner of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra) and giving the UK première of Sibelius’ Violin Concerto in D-Minor.
In 1904 Verbrugghen was invited to join the professors at the Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, becoming the de facto head of strings.
It was to be the springboard that launched his teaching career, as in 1915 he was invited to become the founding principal of the Sydney Conservatorium – an invitation which he accepted.
While there he almost accidentally founded the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and his contribution to Australian musical life is well commemorated.
There is a Verbrugghen Street in Canberra, Australia’s capital, and the main concert hall of the Sydney Conservatorium is called the Verbrugghen Hall.
In addition to his legendary whiskers, Verbrugghen appears to have been a performer with ants in his pants.
By 1922 he found himself the resident conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and in 1933 he was appointed chair of the Department of Music at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota.
It all began for him in Glasgow, where his reputation not only as a virtuoso violinist but an educator and leader of considerable skill was established.
There is no Verbrugghen Street in Glasgow.
Sir Malcolm Arnold (1921 – 2006) was a British composer, many of whose works have become immediately recognisable in the popular classical canon.
He wrote extensively for stage and screen, including five scores for ballets commissioned by the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, and film scores for over 100 films.
Perhaps the most famous of these was his theme and incidental music for Bridge Over the River Kwai in 1957, which was to win him an Oscar the following year.
The British Film Institute voted it the eleventh-best British film of all time.
Despite his fame as a composer, Arnold’s career began on the other side of the music – as a performer.
At the Royal College of Music, he studied composition under Gordon Jacob and trumpet under Ernest Hall (whose original, handwritten and unpublished trumpet method manuscript is also held by our archives), and it was as a trumpeter that his music career was to begin.
In 1941 he joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra as second trumpet, being promoted to principal two years later.
Later he would also become principal trumpet at the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
A slew of awards and accolades would follow, including the Ivor Novello Award in 1959 and 1986, a Fellowship of the Royal College of Music in 1983 and a knighthood in 1993.
In April 2017 an auction of some of Sir Malcolm Arnold’s personal effects took place at Keys Fine Art Auctioneers in Norfolk, and with financial support from the Research and Knowledge Exchange department of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland this 1930s Besson 7 Co Class A Protrano LP Prototype Trumpet (No.
128627) was purchased for the collections.
This is the first time it has been played publicly since Sir Malcolm Arnold used it decades ago.
Sir Alexander Gibson was a pivotal figure in the history of music performance in Scotland.
A graduate of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (as the Scottish National Academy of Music and Royal Scottish Academy of Music), Gibson became an internationally famed conductor.
Not long after graduation, Gibson was appointed Assistant Conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, an impressive appointment for a musician still in his twenties.
One of the orchestra at the time fondly remembered ‘he was the only conductor I knew who conducted from the ear.’
Despite a stint as musical director at Saddler’s Wells and principal conductor at the Scottish National Orchestra (later the Royal Scottish National Orchestra or RSNO), it was opera that was Sir Alec’s (as he was known) real passion, and in 1962 he launched the flagship national opera company: Scottish Opera.
He remained its musical director until 1986.
The Alexander Gibson Opera School, part of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, was completed in 1998, a few years after the maestro’s death.
It was the first and only purpose-built opera school in the UK at the time and continued Gibson’s legacy in promoting the art form.
This bronze bust of Gibson was donated to the Archives & Collections by his widow, Lady Veronica Gibson, in the 1990s.
It is one of a pair sculpted by noted Scottish artist and Glasgow School of Art graduate Archie Forrest.
The other is now housed in Glasgow’s Theatre Royal, home of Gibson’s creation, Scottish Opera.
Our sixth object of ten takes us into the world of drama, initially taught informally at the Glasgow Athenaeum in 1886, and formally added to the syllabus as a diploma and later a degree in 1950.
This is a pantomime dame dress worn by infamous Scottish variety entertainer Jimmy Logan OBE in his guise as Pantomime Dame Lizzie Trotter.
An oil of him wearing the same dress, painted by another Glasgow School of Art graduate (June Crisfield Chapman) also forms part of Jimmy Logan’s extensive archive, donated to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland by his widow, Angela, in 2005.
It remains the largest archive, and one of the most popular, in all the collections.
Jimmy Logan was born Jack Short in Dennistoun, Glasgow, in 1928.
Coming from a theatrical family (his aunt Ella Logan, from whom Jimmy was to adopt his stage name, was already a famous Broadway star in New York, and his parents were the popular Glasgow variety duo Short & Dalziel), Jimmy started his performance career at a young age.
His early pantomime performances brought him to the attention of BBC Scotland, where he was soon to become a household name as a comedian, actor, musician – an all-round performer.
Jimmy’s first big screen acting role came in 1949 in the film Floodtide, a grim romantic drama set in Clydeside directed by Frederick Wilson.
It would be the beginning of a very successful career in the industry, including a couple of now legendary Carry-On films alongside co-star Barbara Windsor.
In 1964 Jimmy bought Glasgow’s Empress Theatre, refurbishing it and re-opening it as the New Metropole Theatre where he was to continue his career as a producer and theatrical impresario.
One of Logan’s best-remembered performance series was his recreations of Sir Harry Lauder’s music hall revues, and although much of his Lauder memorabilia now rests at the University of Glasgow Library’s Special Collections Department and Low Parks Museum in South Lanarkshire, Logan’s original scripts for his Lauder performances form part of his archive at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
They were used to form a re-creation of the re-creation, this time with Jamie MacDougall in the titular role.

In 2012 the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland was bequeathed a collection of national significance relating to the world of opera in the form of the research archive of John Steane.
Opera critic, writer, historian and researcher, Steane was a world authority on opera in the twentieth century and wrote and published extensively on the subject.
Thanks to the generosity of a financial sponsor, the entire contents of Steane’s library were able to be professionally boxed up and shipped to Glasgow for sorting and arranging into their archival and library collections.
Chief among Steane’s interests were the opera stars of the twentieth century, from the earliest part of the century to his contemporaries.
His three-volume work Singers of the Century gave the definitive biographical and performance histories of the divas and divos of the age, many of whom have become household names.
In 2015 the Archives & Collections mounted an exhibition based on materials from the Steane Archive, including twenty archivally framed, hand-signed photographs of opera stars whom Steane admired.
Here we have just one of them; the American-born Greek soprano Maria Callas (1923-1977).
In this image Callas is performing the role of Cio-Cio San, the title role in Puccini’s opera Madama Butterfly.
The photograph is undated but is thought to be from her 1955 performance in Chicago’s Civic Opera House.
A studio recording of Callas as Cio-Cio san was released by EMI earlier that same year, conducted by Herbert von Karajan.
Erik Chisholm’s was a precocious talent.
Graduating top of his class at the Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, one of the youngest in his year, he continued his studies on the East Coast, completing a PhD under musicologist Sir Donald Francis Tovey at Edinburgh University.
Chisholm was a keen proponent of traditional Scottish music in the wider performing arts; he co-founded the Celtic Ballet with Margaret Morris (wife of the Scottish Colourist J.
D.
Fergusson) and was the first composer to incorporate the Scottish idiom, particularly the tropes and motifs found in traditional Gaelic folk tunes, into classical music.
His first piano concerto, an orchestral work in four movements (completed while he was still a student), incorporates many of the evolutions and figures associated with highland bagpipe music (ceòl mòr), which led to it becoming known as the Piobaireachd Concerto.
Early in his career, alongside friends and fellow composers Francis George Scott and Pat Shannon, Chisholm founded the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music.
Despite its vaguely botanical sounding name, the Active Society brought internationally renowned composers such as Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Bax, William Walton and Kaikhosru Sorabji to Glasgow to conduct and perform their own works, including many UK and some world premières.
An archive of Chisholm-related ephemera was donated to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland’s Archives & Collections by his oldest daughter, Morag Chisholm, in 2016.
It included an extensive run of correspondence between Chisholm and the avant-garde pianist/composer Sorabji, beginning around the same time as the formation of the Active Society, and continuing until Chisholm died in 1965.
After formal enough correspondence on musical matters, the letters grow ever more personal, and reading them makes clear that over the years Sorabji grew to fall in love with Chisholm.
It’s important to remember that in the 1930s homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom, and at the time these letters were being exchanged their contents could have been actionable.
Sorabji’s love was unrequited; Chisholm was straight but held no objection to Sorabji’s protestations of his feelings.
The correspondence includes two love poems dedicated to Chisholm, several highly personal exchanges, and a lock of Sorabji’s hair.
It speaks to Chisholm’s open mind (he was a vegetarian, anti-apartheid campaigner and pacifist) that their friendship meant a lot to him, and the record of it all survives in beautiful – if somewhat tragic – detail in our archives.

T he Royal Conservatoire of Scotland became Royal in 1944, thanks to the work of the Principal Sir Ernest Bullock.
Bullock had been organist and choirmaster at Westminster Abbey before being appointed our principal, and it was under those auspices that his connections with the royal family were established.
In 1937 he was charged with writing the fanfares and arranging the National Anthem for the coronation of King George VI, a role which he was later asked to reprise in 1953 with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
The original manuscript compositions for both coronations are now held in our archives.
The first royal patron of the institution was Queen Elizabeth the Queen Consort, later Queen Mother.
She visited the institution on several occasions, touring the facilities and opening the new building on Renfrew Street in March 1988.
This photograph was taken during a visit to the then Academy in 1964; it’s known affectionately in the archives as ‘The Queen Mother as Banksy.’  It is a rarity in itself, as an enquirer once pointed out it was unusual to see Her Majesty at a function with her gloves off.
From the very genuine smile on her face it seems clear that she enjoyed her visit to the stage and set design studios.
In 1993, when Royal Conservatoire of Scotland became the first conservatoire in the UK to gain its own degree awarding powers, the late Queen Mother as patron became the first recipient.
The degree was conferred on her honoris causa in Clarence House.
Upon the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, at the age of 101, the royal patronage of the Conservatoire was transferred to her grandson, His Royal Highness the Duke of Rothesay.
One of the most recent additions to the Archives and Collections is an Early and Important Music archive.
This project is actively collecting original music manuscripts and early (pre-1800) print music.
One of the earliest groupings in this Collection, and certainly one of the rarest, is a late eighteenth-century manuscript set of scores for Mozart’s Le Nozze di Figaro (‘The Marriage of Figaro’).
As was the convention at the time there is no date given, however, preliminary research on the paper and ink suggests that these volumes were transcribed in the late 1700s, making them almost certainly produced in Mozart’s lifetime.
Figaro, an opera in four acts, was composed in 1786 (five years before the composer’s untimely death at the age of 33) to a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte.
Voted by Classical Music magazine as one of the twenty greatest operas ever written, the story is thought to be largely based on Pierre Beaumarchais’s stage comedy La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro (‘The Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro’), produced two years earlier.
It follows the travails of the title character Figaro in his attempts to marry Susanna while foiling the attempts of their employer Count Almaviva to steal her away from him.
Figaro remains one of Mozart’s most popular and enduring operas and is regularly still performed.
A catalogue of the Early and Important Music Collection can be found on our Archives Hub .

Engagement is how we share our specialist knowledge and expertise with audiences, learners, businesses and communities beyond the Conservatoire, for wider social, cultural and economic benefit.
We support and celebrate all the big, small, formal and informal ways our engaged practitioners contribute to the development of our sector and communities.
Leading engagement development activity across the Conservatoire, the Engagement Team offers strategic direction and support to RCS staff, students and graduates through focused initiatives and programmes.
We empower our community of artists and makers to pursue, develop and scale impactful projects through targeted funding, awards, mentorship, and training.
We support company start-up and commercialisation, inspire new collaborations and innovative thinking, and work closely with colleagues from all areas of the institution to drive public engagement initiatives.
Setting up new pathways for success and impact, our engagement work focuses on three main areas of delivery: Creative Enterprise, Innovation, and Public Engagement, each underpinned by targeted funding and support.
Our Creative Enterprise strand is a catalyst for new artistic ventures and business models, helping the RCS community realise their entrepreneurial ambitions.
Through the Creative Enterprise Development Office (CEDO), we provide tailored business support, facilitate introductions to strategic partners, and connect individuals with different funding opportunities.
We are deeply committed to driving innovation within the creative sector.
Building on the success of our two-year pilot project, we are now focused on growing and embedding Innovation Studio as our flagship programme for supporting creative experimentation, collaboration, and interdisciplinary work.
Public Engagement is at the heart of our work at RCS.
As one of Scotland’s busiest arts venues, the Conservatoire welcomes thousands of audience members every year.
In addition, the Engagement team helps develop new initiatives that share expertise and bring meaningful benefits to communities and the wider public.
A wide range of funding and support opportunities are available to RCS students, staff and alumni.
We support work at all stages of development, and the Engagement Team can help determine which offer will best meet the needs of your individual project.
To further strengthen the Conservatoire’s economic and social impact, we recognise the importance of building a strong engagement culture and infrastructure that bridges disciplines, practices and expertise to create positive change for our art forms and across society.
Beyond the Conservatoire, our connections and relationships with the world are rooted locally and extend internationally, with artists and arts organisations, creative companies, local and national government, national and international agencies, businesses, institutions and networks.
We are curious and love to explore new ways of working from one-off micro-projects with individuals to large-scale multi-partner initiatives across a number of years.

This project converges Singing for Health practitioners, researchers, and health professionals from across Scotland to form a network which supports practitioners and facilitates collaboration and knowledge exchange to boost public health and wellbeing.
Singing for Health groups aid the management of a range of conditions such as respiratory conditions, dementia, Parkinson’s, and mental health concerns.
It is the first Scotland-wide network to unite practitioners, researchers and health professionals working in these health-related fields.
Led by Dr Brianna Robertson-Kirkland at RCS and Dr Sophie Boyd the initiative, supported by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the RCS Innovation Studio and The Founders Fund for Creatives, provides a space for a diverse community of singing practitioners and researchers working on singing and health, to come together to share knowledge, ideas and practice and to open-up avenues for communication between individuals and organisations.
The initiative so far has produced: a digital map showing the locations of Singing for Health groups in Scotland; created three podcast series ’ that highlight different approaches and issues related to Singing for Health; and provided links to research evidencing the potential impacts singing can have on individuals, patients, service users, and singers.
SSfHN has also worked with the Musicians’ Union to offer guidance on rates of pay for Singing for Health Practitioners, developed a CPD short course for current and future practitioners to develop their skills in understanding Singing for Health research and maximising their chances of obtaining funding, and are currently working with universities throughout Scotland to embed Singing for Health in medical school curricular.
The network hosts a range of workshops to support Singing for Health groups allowing them to showcase their work as well as providing a space to consider larger issues including how to engage and work alongside health professionals.
Following the workshop that took on 7 March 2023, SSfHN have produced a report identifying key challenges in delivering Singing Health services in Scotland, and what Scotland’s Singing for Health Network are doing to address these challenges.

Ultimately focused on highlighting themes of biodiversity and ecological restoration, the project also integrates with the Green Wall Initiative, which is led by Ulysse Tonnelé-Verjus, current SU President and is supported by Glasgow City Council’s Youth Climate Action Fund.
An educational and artistic mural will be created inside the RCS building, focusing on Scottish ecosystems, the climate crisis, and how communities can engage in ecological restoration.
By fostering cross-sector collaboration and encouraging community ownership of public spaces, the project is set to achieve lasting impact.

As such, we always invite our Corporate Partners — especially those who organise events or showcases themselves — to book our student performers and create bespoke events as part of a broader partnership package with RCS.

Make a lasting impact on the future work of RCS and our students.
Download or Request an RCS Legacy Guide
Legacy giving is one of the most impactful ways to support RCS.
While tuition fees and government grants cover a significant portion of the Conservatoire’s income, they alone are not enough to sustain the full breadth of the student experience.
Charitable donations, including legacies, help bridge the gap and support the next generation of artists and creative producers to learn and to thrive.
These gifts fund scholarships, support student projects, and enable RCS to maintain and upgrade its facilities.
Additionally, they provide vital flexibility, allowing the Conservatoire to respond to emerging needs and opportunities.
In recent years, legacy gifts have helped RCS students access the best training, facilities, and opportunities, helping them to excel in their artistic careers.
RCS is unique in its dual role as both an educational institution and an arts charity.
This means it must balance the financial demands of providing top-tier education with its mission to enrich Scotland’s cultural landscape through public performances and events.
The largest source of income for RCS comes from government grants (50%), followed by tuition fees (32%).
Charitable donations, including legacies, account for around 7% of our income, making them a critical component of the Conservatoire’s financial health.
Like many arts institutions, RCS faces financial challenges, including rising operational costs and reduced public funding.
However, with careful management and the generosity of donors, RCS continues to deliver world-class education and performance.
Approximately one third of RCS students receive financial aid through scholarships and bursaries funded by donations.
Legacy gifts play a key role in sustaining and expanding these essential support programmes , without which education would have been financially inaccessible to many of our students.
“Our long experience of working with RCS, and the enjoyment it has brought us, have given us huge confidence in gifting our legacy to the Conservatoire.
For all the reasons for having supported RCS over a number of years, it makes absolute sense to continue to support it after we are no longer here.
Being aware of the importance of bequests in enabling the RCS to continue as a global leader in performing arts education, we have had no hesitation in continuing our support through our final legacies.” — Caroline and John Sibbald
“There are young people who dream of a future in the Performing Arts.
They, and we, are lucky to have the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which is one of the foremost institutions of its type in the world.
They, because RCS offers them access to all that they require to develop their talents in order to realise their ambitions and we, as they make that journey, are able to enjoy performances by them.
All of this comes at a cost which money from Government and fees cannot meet, and so I am happy to contribute to RCS through their Friends and Patrons Scheme, and also by leaving a legacy to them, which comes at no cost to me.
This in a small way helps to ensure the continuation of excellence in the Performing Arts, which I so much enjoy, into the future.” — Legacy Pledger and long-time visitor of the Conservatoire
We are proud to recognise the invaluable generosity of those who choose to leave a legacy for the RCS in their will.
This special group consists of people who share a deep appreciation of the performing arts and play a vital role in the continued success of the Conservatoire.

Pam Dow was a much loved and highly respected member of the Junior Conservatoire Staff (1978-2020).
As well as her remarkable career as a performer (Principal Percussionist with the RSNO, 1967-1999), she was also an outstanding educator whose skills as a teacher and mentor impacted the lives of countless young musicians, ranging in age from primary school children to postgraduate students.
Pam’s passion for enabling and developing young talent was unique.
We are delighted that this new scholarship will enable us to continue and honour her legacy and help students access world-class education at the Junior Conservatoire of Music.
This new scholarship, which will be awarded annually as part of the Junior Conservatoire bursary process, has been enabled by the generosity of the trustees of Pam’s estate.
We are delighted that this scholarship will enable us to continue and honour her legacy.
In these current times of severe economic hardship, the scholarship will support the recipient(s) to further their musical development by accessing the specialist teaching, training and performance opportunities that are afforded by a place at the Junior Conservatoire (Music).
“Pamella Dow was an inspiration to all – her commitment and zeal for her students remains uniquely legendary.
Hundreds of young musicians benefited from her energetic devotion and this scholarship will celebrate that passion.
“Thanks to her generosity, we can now further Pam’s legacy and continue to feel such enormous gratitude for her huge contribution to music education.”
“Pam would always go that extra mile to help her pupils, often lending them material, sticks and even instruments.
“She was a force to be reckoned with, driven by her passion to help others achieve their goals, taking great pleasure seeing her pupils achieve success.
Pam was also humorous and a great problem solver for many a student.
Over the years she became a ‘Musical Mother’ to many, many of which are now working professionally still remembering and using the ‘tricks of the trade’ taught to the them by Pam.”
Our students can access specialist training across the performing and production arts, from world-class teachers and visiting artists who are leaders in their particular field.

New sentences found on https://rcs.ac.uk/support-us/ways-to-support/scholarship-funds/pauline-knowles:
An alumna of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Pauline Knowles established herself as one of the pre-eminent Scottish stage actors of her generation in a dazzling career which spanned thirty years.
Hugely respected by other actors for her integrity, graft and craft, she specialised in thrilling vocal performances and characterisations of ambiguity and inscrutability, with a dazzling range from tragic majesty as Clytemnestra in Oresteia: This Restless House by Zinnie Harris (Citizens’, Glasgow), to comic genius in the opera Pass the Spoon by David Shrigley (Magnetic North).
Pauline had an unerring dramaturgical eye and specialised in the development of new plays.
Her work on variety of roles was shown in her appearance on every Scottish theatre’s stage.
In a tribute to the late Pauline Knowles, who famously created the lead role of the Young Woman in the original production of Knives in Hens , and who died at the age of 50 in October 2018, the performed reading of the play at the Lyceum Theatre on 11 June 2019 reunited many of the original team from 1995.
All proceeds from this special performance of Knives in Hens went to support the Pauline Knowles Scholarship Fund at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which has been set up by RCS, Pearlfisher and David Harrower and will support Scottish BA Acting students.
We spoke to some of our students and alumni about Pauline’s legacy and the importance of scholarships for the performing arts.
With the initial fundraising effort from Knives in Hens , the Pauline Knowles Scholarship will be endowed, which allows it to help Conservatoire drama students indefinitely.
You can donate now to help us continue the scholarship.
The aim of the scholarship is to support a Scottish or Scotland-based BA Acting student throughout their training and help relieve the burden of the expenses of a Higher Education degree.

War in Ukraine is having a devastating impact with far-reaching consequences.
Lives are being lost, homes and futures destroyed, families displaced and fearful of what the future holds for their children and communities.
From September 2022, a number of young artists from Ukraine will be starting or resuming their studies at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
Due to their status as refugees from Ukraine, their fees will be covered by the Scottish Government as Home students.
However many will need considerable support to cover the costs incurred by arriving in Scotland from a war-torn country, including help with instruments, equipment and living costs.
That’s why RCS has established the Ukrainian Students Bursary Fund to help these young people pursue their creative ambitions in Scotland.

#RCSAlumni
BA Acting, 2017
“What I loved about training at the RCS was how much emphasis was placed on personal and artistic exploration, making your own work, interdisciplinary creation and drawing upon an international network.”
MA CCT Acting, 2014
Alumna Isobel McArthur is an actor, playwright and theatre-maker who graduated from the MACCT Acting in 2014.
Isobel wrote and directed Pride and Prejudice * (sort of) which was awarded an Olivier in 2022 for Best Entertainment or Comedy Play.
Tori Burgess (MACCT Acting, 2015), Christina Gordon (BA Musical Theatre, 2015) and Meghan Tyler (BA Acting, 2014) are also in the cast.
BA Music Performance, 1990
“Without a doubt, the RCS prepares young players for life in the profession.
On the Music Performance course there we so many repertoire classes, orchestras, and masterclasses apart from individual tutoring.
There were numerous opportunities to learn orchestral works inside out, not just standard repertoire, and contemporary pieces, but music by Scottish composers and student composers too.
There was always a group to play in or an orchestra to perform with daily which allowed us to learn the art of performing.”
Master of Drama (Acting), 2003
“My course covered a lot of bases including theatre, television, film, and radio.
We were also given the opportunity to devise a new play with Vanishing Point, which we took to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival – it also became our London showcase at the end of the year.
[…] RCS provided a safe environment in which to experiment and to make and learn from mistakes.”
Diploma of Speech and Drama, 1977
“Aside from the practical and historical study of drama, I think the greatest gift from that period was developing the ability to think creatively and constructively.
My first teaching appointment was in Glasgow, following placements in the east end and a List D school for girls.
Unfortunately, at that time there was no syllabus for drama in schools.
I had a timetable of predominantly challenging classes which was, at once, exhausting, enlightening and enjoyable.
After working in Glasgow for several years, I moved to Shetland.
At that time, Shetland Islands Council did not employ drama teachers.
I became a member of the Shetland Folk Festival Committee, played with local traditional musicians and taught in Additional Support Needs and project-related drama productions.”
Diploma of Dramatic Arts, 1967
“The rigorous training served me well.
When I returned home years later in 1971, I was immediately put in charge of music and drama for the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, a department that had almost been non-existent before I arrived.
I was also made a Senior Producer with responsibility for seven programmes a week.
I developed what I called Development Oriented Drama, to open the eyes of the Government and community to what could make for the betterment of Sierra Leone.”
BA Modern Ballet, 2015
“I came to be the youngest Greek judge in the history of Dancing with the Stars on TV and the first Greek person on the cover of the UK’s best-selling LGBTQI+ magazine, Attitude, in 2019.
Whilst my TedX speech, I am not just a dancer has reached over 100k views.
I feel incredibly grateful.
[…]
It was so educative to be able to explore the different types of people, cultures, backgrounds and talents, especially through studying in RCS.
I had my bad moments as I was living far from home at 18 but Glasgow and its people were so welcoming and warm.”
Diploma of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music, 1956
“Never stop learning.
Keep your mind and ears open.
Always perform to the very best of your ability and don’t let personal likes and dislikes interfere.
Keep them to yourself, it is your ability your employer pays you for and remember that getting your diploma or degree is not the end it’s only the beginning.”
BMus Composition, 1995
“After studying at RCS, I started writing TV themes and music for theatre from a room at CaVa Studios in Glasgow.
I would then get phone calls from the bands recording at CaVa asking me to do string arrangements for their songs.
The music scene was thriving, and I got to work with bands like Simple Minds, Texas, Mogwai, Isobel Campbell, Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol.
The film guys loved the fact that I worked with bands, so I started getting asked to compose for film scores.
I got a BAFTA for my first film score, which helped me get on the composing scene for TV, doing programmes like Silent Witness and Spooks.”
BA Technical and Production Arts, 2003
“When I got into the RSAMD, I really enjoyed being part of the buzz, but the backstage side of it.
The excitement and enjoyment were the same, but there was a shift in perspective.
I enjoy being one of those little ninjas in the background that nobody really sees but makes the magic happen.”
MMus Clarinet, 2007
“There weren’t lots of kids playing instruments at my school, so I had to go elsewhere to join ensembles, I started in the Aberdeen City Youth Wind Band first and then joined the Aberdeen City Youth Symphony Orchestra.
I absolutely loved both and it was then I decided this is what I wanted to pursue.
I moved to Glasgow in September 2000 to study at RSAMD, and 23 years later, I’m still here!
[…] I also love working in the Artistic Planning Team.
I think we’re a hardworking and passionate team that will go out of our way to help anyone who asks for it.
The team are also the funniest bunch of people you’ll ever meet and working with them all every day is a total joy.
That’s what makes me love my job.”
BEd Music, 1994
“I studied in the BEd (Music) programme at RSAMD from 1990-1994.
I loved the intensity and breadth of study – one day learning about music history and harmony, the next child development and educational psychology, and then putting everything together in the music classroom.
Highlights of the course were our 3 rd year recording project (I arranged ‘Smoke gets in your eyes’), our 3 rd year external concert, and my Honours piano recital (Poulenc’s Les soirées de Nazelles ).”
BA Music Performance, 1987
“I was very active performing worldwide and was delighted to be asked to come in and teach students.
I was 23 years old, so not that much older than the cohort, and we had a lot of things in common – principally the love of playing guitar.
There have been many [memorable moments], to be honest; performing at Tartan Week in Grand Central Station, NYC was pretty cool, being escorted to the stage in Venezuela with an armed guard (didn’t think I was that bad!?), playing to Hans Werner Henze in El Cimarron at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.
Maybe playing the Aranjuez Concerto with the RSNO at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is up there as well.”
MMus Piano, 2009
“ I’ve worked on movies including Boss Baby , Dunkirk , Pirates of the Caribbean , and Kung Fu Panda 3 .
I also orchestrated BBC’s Blue Planet II , Big Cat , and National Geographic’s Princess Diana documentary, Diana: in Her Own Words .
“RCS gave me confidence so that I could recognise myself as a musician.
I found an incredibly supportive and positive environment there.
[…] I liked that there was a drama department, with so many plays performed by student actors.
I believe that the different artistic disciplines should inspire each other.
[…] We can’t isolate music, bury our heads in the sand and ignore the environment.
Music is part of human culture and is therefore intrinsically linked to everything else in life.”
Diploma of Stage Management Studies, 1995
“All my spare time was spent in youth theatres, in particular Scottish Youth Theatre, and when a couple of my friends got into other drama schools, I decided to put in a speculative application to the RSAMD and they called my bluff!”
“I’ve always tried to keep my hand in the arts, working on short films, theatre, and radio.
I was the producer of the feature film, Fast Romance , which I made with three friends.
Fast Romance made it onto the big screen, and we won a BAFTA.
It was a major achievement, everyone working on the film worked full-time, making the film on evenings and weekends.”
MA Musical Theatre, 2009
“Having never been to Glasgow before enrolling, I didn’t know what to expect.
Luckily, I absolutely LOVED living and studying in Glasgow.
It’s a vibrant city with amazing people.
My first impression of the building on Renfrew Street was that of a bustling hub of creativity.
On any given day, I would walk down the corridor as I made my way to class and hear a xylophonist practising, an actor reciting Shakespeare, or opera singers perfecting a Mozart love duet.
The atmosphere alone stimulated an amazing amount of development in my year group, both personal and artistic, and though we’re now all spread around the world, it’s always inspiring to see their diverse achievements and the varied work they’re all doing in their respective countries, cities and communities.”
MMus Performance, 2011
“We’ve been in the current lineup for the past ten years, which has been a wonderful adventure.
We tour around the world and have visited some very beautiful and interesting places along the way.”
“Whilst I was a student at RCS there were lots of performance opportunities which I think helped me gain experience and feel comfortable being in front of an audience.
Having a weekly lesson from both of my wonderful teachers was also hugely helpful and inspiring.
I was given the chance to perform in several masterclasses with world-class musicians.” (George)
“I’d felt a bit lost when I first moved to RCS, but the close-knit nature of the student community, as well as the breadth of courses and teaching, offered me a space that felt at once like ‘home’, but also allowed me the chance to realise that there were more options open to me as a cellist than I had previously considered.” (Duncan)
BA Scottish Music, 2013
“My time at RCS was invaluable in preparing me for the professional music world.
The rigorous training and exposure to a wide range of musical styles and techniques helped me develop a versatile skill set.
Numerous performance opportunities and collaborations with talented musicians built my confidence and experience.”
BA Technical and Production Arts, 2011
“By the very nature of RCS being a conservatoire, it meant I experienced live performance in many forms.
By the time I graduated, I’d designed multiple types of theatre including, opera, dance, musical theatre and contemporary performance.
Not only was there diversity in the types of work but also the venues, equipment, and people.
The whole experience taught me that the more you put into something, the more you get out.”
BA Modern Ballet, 2019
“I remember my time at RCS was full of hard work, because let’s be real: ballet is really hard.
I have many wonderful memories shared with some very talented artists from all departments across RCS.
I can assure you that every person you meet on this course will inspire you to do more.
The years at RCS completely flew by, always being a treasured chapter of my life to look back on.”
MA CCT (Acting), 2009
“I was part of the inaugural class of the Classical and Contemporary Text program.
When you’re the first, you’re the experiment, in many ways, so, my classmates and I used this as an opportunity to advocate what we needed, as students.
This advocation has served me well post-graduation when I entered professional environments, in the UK and back home, and applied that advocacy for myself and others.”
MMus Performance Voice, 2013
“I think it’s important to know who you are as a person, where your interests lie and remember that not everyone has the same path.
Whilst it can be tough swimming against the tide, now more than ever, I have found it important to have a portfolio career that lets me explore, travel, create and grow as a performer.”
BA Dramatic Studies, 1995
“It was quite intense!
It was my second degree; having become clear that I wanted to be a director and the BA in Dramatic Studies was the best route for this.
It was a very rounded course, covering all sorts of disciplines within theatre.”
“I would say that the range of skills that you learn really prepare you for any line of work.
At that time the internet was in its infancy so the type of jobs on offer were different.
This made us resilient and resourceful.
Work had to be studied in libraries, books read, research done without AI or YouTube.
There always seemed to be full days and it was hard work.
But it was always creative, and this would spark that creativity in you.
I used many of the lessons as a teacher when I left, and I continue to do so today.
I may even have the make-up brushes that we bought for our classes…”
BMus Performance Voice, 2019
“My time at RCS emphasised the importance of being a dynamic collaborator and a strong communicator.
It gave me the confidence to walk into any room – an audition, an interview, a networking event – and engage with people from all walks of life.
RCS taught me how to advocate for the performing arts and how to champion not just my own work, but the work of fellow artists as well.”

The Young Company of the Centre Dramatique National (CDN) in Tours, France, is proud to host a festival dedicated to emerging theatre artists: the Festival WET (Week-End at the Theatre).
For its 10th edition, the CDN of Tours has chosen the UK as this year’s European focus.
As such, one of the 8 selected shows must come from the UK or be created by UK-based artists.
Festival WET attracts a large number of professionals from the French theatre scene, offering great visibility for participating companies and potential touring opportunities afterward.
As the festival is organised by a national theatre, your team’s travel and accommodation costs will be covered, and performances will be paid.
Festival WET supports bold, multidisciplinary work and projects that take artistic risks.
You can find more information about this year’s edition here: https://cdntours.fr/programmation/festival-wet
We will finalise programming in November 2025 , and the next edition of the festival will take place in March 2026 .
Please note: at this stage, we only select fully completed shows.
In France, a company is generally considered “emerging” if it was founded within the last 7 years and has created fewer than 5 shows.
That said, there are no strict criteria—it’s assessed case by case.
To be eligible, your show must have been performed in 2023, 2024, or 2025 , and your team must be available from March 24th to 29th, 2026 .
If you’re interested in applying, please send the following materials to programmation.wet@cdntours.fr :
Please don’t wait until the last minute to apply!
Warm regards,

Here is a short video from Ali de Souza, lecturer on the BA Acting with some tips on filming your audition.
Your monologues will be assessed by our lecturers and if successful you will be invited to an interview via Teams.
We aim to let you know the outcome within 7 days after your interview.
* The Contemporary Monologue
It is safe to consider anything written in the latter half of the twentieth century onwards to be contemporary.
However, even a period play written in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century if it has been adapted by a living author is considered as contemporary.
So for example Tom Stoppard’s adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s Three Sisters or Zinnie Harris’ adaptation of Strindberg’s Miss Julie would both be fine.
A good rule is if the author is alive, or could theoretically still be alive if they died young (e.g.
Sarah Kane) then you can consider the work as contemporary.
Of course finding a speech from a relatively new work (e.g.
from the last ten years or so) gives us some indication of your knowledge, understanding and passion for theatre today, so the more recent the work, the better
This course is ideal for those who want to experience drama school training but are not ready or able to go into full time study.

Royal Conservatoire of Scotland
by Sarah Ruhl Adapted from the novel by Virginia Woolf
Directed by Tal Schatsky
Multi-Buy Offer – Save 10% when you buy tickets for 2 of our September Acting productions, or save 20% when you buy tickets for all 3.
Orlando is an Odyssean-style coming-of-age epic, a surrealist dreamscape, a campy, anticolonial satire, and a liberated queer utopia.
It is also one of the greatest love letters of all time.
Its title character, inspired by Woolf’s great love Vita Sackville West, embarks on a centuries-long fantastical adventure, meets a series of parodied historical and literary figures, changes gender, and finds, loses and ultimately re-finds love.
It’s a journey that traverses boundaries of time, place, gender, and sexuality and asks what it means to find (or is it construct?) one’s identity and a sense of belonging.
This ensemble staging of Sarah Ruhl’s adaptation will lean into the playfulness, imagination, individuality, and joy at the centre of Woolf’s original work.
ORLANDO was commissioned by Joyce Piven and was first produced at the Piven Theater Workshop, directed by Joyce Piven.
It was subsequently produced at the Actor’s Gang in Los Angeles, produced by Tim Robins, and directed by Joyce Piven.
It was produced in New York at Classic Stage Company, produced by Brian Kullick, directed by Rebecca Taichman.

By Anne Washburn Score by Michael Friedman
Directed by Gracie Davie
It’s the end of the world: the grid is down, loved ones are uncontactable and the survivors are unsure how many miles lie between themselves and nuclear collapse.
So they turn to The Simpsons …
In this dark comedy, a frame-by-frame retelling of the “Cape Feare” episode becomes mythologised – over 75 years – into an absurd act of hopefulness and human persistence.
There will be singing.
There will be dancing.
There will be a lot of Simpsons references.
Anne Washburn’s excellent, thought-provoking play challenges us to reconsider which stories shape us, and how we can use them to find courage in the strangest of situations, ultimately asking the vital question: what does it mean to keep going when everything else is destroyed?

August 25, 2025
We are thrilled former Principal John Wallace has been presented with Honorary Membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society .
John was presented with this prestigious membership on-stage on Sunday 24 August where he was performing with the ensemble he founded almost 40 years ago: The Wallace Collection.
Since 1826, the RPS has presented Honorary Membership in recognition of those who devote their lives to music and uplifting others with it.
It has been presented to some of the most important musicians in recent times.
Recipients include Berlioz, Liszt, Wagner, Brahms, Dvořák, Clara Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel, Stravinsky, Yehudi Menuhin, Fanny Waterman and more recently Evelyn Glennie, Stephen Sondheim, Judith Weir, and James MacMillan.
John is the second trumpeter to receive it, following Philip Jones in 1999, in whose ensemble John performed earlier in his career.
Internationally-renowned Scottish trumpet soloist, composer and educator, John Wallace CBE started playing the trumpet when he was seven years old.
His professional career spans many decades, and has seen him attain titled roles at the Philharmonia (where he was Principal Trumpet and Vice Chair), Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, and London Symphony Orchestra.
John has dedicated much of his career to music education, as Head of Brass at the Royal Academy of Music in London, before holding the position of Principal of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland from 2002 until 2014.
Consequently, John convened the Music Education Partnership Group, which has worked tirelessly to secure free instrumental tuition in Scottish state schools.
He has served as Chair for Glasgow Barons, President of St Mary’s Music School in Edinburgh, and Patron of the Scottish Brass Band Association where, in 2025, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award.
John was presented with his Honorary Membership certificate by RPS Chief Executive James Murphy and RPS Trustee Jo Buckley , with the following citation:
“ He is a torch-bearer for music education.
[…] He is an enduring crusader, in multiple roles, particularly in convening the Music Education Partnership Group, to ensure Scottish children have opportunities to be musically adventurous themselves.
“John, the spirit and selflessness with which you have done all this, all your life, is inspirational.
[…] You are an exemplar to us all, and a genuine national treasure .”

The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is deeply saddened to announce the passing of Kurt-Hans Goedicke , the distinguished timpanist and retired Head of Percussion at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
His illustrious performance career included serving as Principal Timpanist with the RTÉ Symphony Orchestra in Dublin before joining the London Symphony Orchestra in 1964, a position he held with distinction until 2000.
As a leading educationalist, he served as Head of Timpani and Percussion at the Royal Academy of Music before moving to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where he served as Head of Percussion and Distinguished Fellow in Timpani.
Professor Aaron Shorr , Director of Music said:
“ Kurt-Hans Goedicke was a towering figure in the world of orchestral percussion, inspiring generations of students and colleagues.
Personally, I still vividly recall his performances with the London Symphony in the 1980’s, where I was invariably transfixed by his overwhelming musical presence, mesmeric musical rigour, exactitude and power.
He was a timpanist for the ages, working with some of the greatest artists of our time, including Pierre Boulez and Leonard Bernstein, while also providing a foundational presence in the iconic film scores of Star Wars and Indiana Jones .
He will be profoundly missed, but his legacy and impact on the profession are beyond doubt.
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland will dedicate the Percussion Department concert on 1 December to his memory.”
To celebrate his artistry, we share two historic moments: an interview in which he reflects on his work in the Star Wars film scores, and a performance of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring with Leonard Bernstein and the London Symphony Orchestra.

August 14, 2025
Some of Scotland’s leading arts and cultural institutions, technology companies, and creative pioneers are joining forces in a new project exploring the future of the performing arts through the lens of digital innovation and artificial intelligence.
Led by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) and supported by the Scottish Government’s Ecosystem Fund , Split Screen will serve as a dynamic testbed for creative experimentation and entrepreneurship.
The initiative brings together a powerhouse collective of national partners – Scottish Opera , Scottish Ballet , Citizens Theatre , Codebase , Techscaler , Creative Glasgow and Anam Creative .
Around 100 staff and freelancers will take part in a series of events, between November and March, designed to share skills, spark ideas and expand networks.
The aim of Split Screen is to bring this diverse group of organisations together with a single enquiry around digital innovation in the performing arts, exploring shared challenges and opportunities, said Deborah Keogh , Head of Engagement at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
“ Split Screen will bring together some of Scotland’s most talented artists, creative organisations and digital experts to explore how technology can open up fresh ways of making and sharing performance.
“ The events are a chance to test ideas, form new collaborations and support participants to develop work in ways that reflect how audiences and industries are changing.
It puts artists at the centre of shaping what the future of performance could look like.
Dominic Hill , Artistic Director, Citizens Theatre said: “ Theatre has always evolved by embracing new ideas, and Split Screen is an exciting opportunity to explore how digital innovation can shape the stories we tell and how we share them.
Working alongside such a diverse group of partners allows us to imagine bold new possibilities for performance and for connecting with audiences in the years ahead.
With Codebase – a national ecosystem builder which runs the Scottish Government’s Techscaler programme – as delivery partners, the project will include three half-day workshops, which will culminate in five micro commissions to support the next steps of new projects that emerge.
Yasmin Sulaiman , SVP Strategic Partnerships, CodeBase said: “ CodeBase is delighted to be working on Split Screen with such a fantastic array of partners.
The Creative Industries has long been one of the most exciting and innovative sectors in Scotland’s economy, and we can’t wait to discover and support the creative entrepreneurs that will emerge through this brilliant programme.
Split Screen aims to:
The initiative builds on the recent appointment of Mark Logan OBE , Scotland’s former Chief Entrepreneur and Chief Operating Officer at Skyscanner, as Entrepreneur in Residence at RCS.
In his two-year RCS tenure, which began in May, Logan will play a key role in unlocking the economic potential of Glasgow’s creative and performing arts supercluster.
Deborah added: “ Mark’s primary focus is to connect Glasgow’s creative economy assets – working closely with key stakeholders – into a visible and recognised supercluster of real scale and impact.
“ This will be underpinned by a new economic success narrative that places individual artists, sole traders and microenterprises at the centre of a thriving ecosystem, alongside anchor education institutions, grassroots artist networks, national performing arts companies, cultural organisations and content creators.
Split Screen has received the maximum award of £40,000 from the Scottish Government’s Ecosystem Fund, which is being match-funded by RCS with additional in-kind from Techscaler.
Rosemary James-Beith , Membership and Programme Manager at Creative Glasgow, said: “ Creative Glasgow is delighted to be contributing to Split Screen.
At this critical juncture, when AI and technological developments are rapidly reshaping work within the creative and cultural sectors, we feel it is vital that Creative Glasgow connects its membership community, creative practitioners and organisations across Greater Glasgow, with new skills, expertise, knowledge in this area.
“ Further, we see the creative and generative potential in Split Screen’s provision of opportunities to seriously explore emergent creative tools and services collaboratively with our members.
“ While focused on the performing arts, this project will undoubtedly have far-reaching impacts across the creative and cultural sectors, and will be a force for generating shared understanding of both the challenges and the opportunities posed by this technology.
“ We look forward to embarking on this work with the illustrious partnership it brings together.

We feel that currently it is a disproportionate burden in terms of size, resources and the estimated costs on our organisation to fix the issues above immediately as there are over 3,000 occurrences of these and some of these issues would require a design change.
The updates above would require more time to be spent manually updating and checking.
As there are only two full time roles, we are already quite stretched with working on current updates to provide important information to our users so we feel currently there isn’t the resource to fix all the above issues.
We have also never had any requests for information to be provided in a different format.
Paying for detailed audits
We have assessed using estimates from GOV.UK’s accessibility audit information that it would cost between £7,800 and £13,000 to do a detailed audit and re-check of our website.
We are continuously adding new pages and content to our website so we would need to do regular checks which would add to this cost.
Instead of paying for a detailed audit, we have paid for a low-cost tool, SortSite and using Axe to check the website, which has allowed us budget to fix accessibility issues.
Fixing pdf documents
We have 1,778 documents on our site with the majority being old and unused documents.
We feel it’s a disproportionate burden to fix all documents given our small team and budget as many of these documents are old.
We are continuing to check that new documents are as accessible as they can be.
We also state on our accessibility statement that we can provide another format if a user needed to access any information and was unable to do so.
Assessment of costs against benefits
We believe the issues above are a disproportionate burden due to the cost, resources and size of our team.
However, we are re-assessing with our developers what can be fixed.
We believe that the cost of paying for detailed audits is a disproportionate burden, we can instead continue to fix issues within our budget which we feel will benefit users more.
We are regularly re-assessing our statement and where possible, hope to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible.
Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
PDFs and other documents
Our PDF and Word documents aren’t fully accessible to screen readers.
Any PDFs and Word documents published before 23 September 2018 will be as accessible as they can be however we realise that this still isn’t fully accessible.
The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
Currently, it would be a disproportionate burden to display PDFs and other documents published after 23 September 2018 as HTML on our website as it would require additional resource that is currently outwith the scope of the team.
We are working on making our PDFs and other documents that were published after 23 September 2018 accessible.
Live video
We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
Third-party content
We may display third-party content that we have not paid for or developed on our website which is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
Preparation of this accessibility statement
This statement was prepared on 11 September 2020.
It was last reviewed on 14 July 2022.
This website was last tested on 14 June 2022.
The test was carried out using Axe, Sortsite and a manual check.
We tested a random selection of pages from our website.

Sat 30 – Sun 31 August 2025
‘We have no slaves in Scotland’
In 1687, a remarkable legal case unfolded in the Scottish courts – one that would echo through the centuries as a powerful testament to the value of human freedom.
A young girl, known only to history as ‘the tumbling lassie’ was rescued by the Scots of Harden after escaping a life of exploitation as an acrobat in a travelling show.
Mr Reid, a travelling showman, claimed the child as his property.
After all, he had bought her from her mother.
The Court of Session in Edinburgh responded with a simple and profound declaration proclaiming that slavery had no place in Scots law – ‘We have no slaves in Scotland’.
The Tumbling Lassie brings the story of this largely forgotten but profoundly significant moment in Scottish legal history to life.
The Tumbling Lassie herself, lost to history without even a recorded name, becomes the centre of our story – not merely a victim, but a symbol of resilience, freedom and the enduring fight against human trafficking and modern slavery.
It challenges us to reflect on how far we have come – and how far we still have to go – in safeguarding the rights and dignity of the most vulnerable in society.
This production is more than a window to the past – it is a call to action.
Today, millions around the world still suffer in conditions of slavery and human trafficking.
We are proud to bring this powerful story to the stage, honouring the tumbling lassie herself and all those who continue the struggle for freedom today.
This production proudly acknowledges the work of The Tumbling Lassie Committee , a Scottish-based initiative named after the historic case, which raises awareness and funds to support victims of modern slavery and human trafficking.
Through events, outreach, and advocacy, the Committee keeps the legacy of the tumbling lassie alive by helping those whose freedom is still at risk.
Price: £23.50 (£21.50 conc) + £1 commission per ticket

On the Verge (OTV) has been running as an online festival of digital work for several years now, and it has quickly become a highlight of the calendar for our cohort.
It arrives at a point in the year when students have begun to fully engage with the course’s focus on the synthesis of individual agency and collaborative practice — something OTV allows them to explore in a fresh medium.
For 2025, the students have taken this invitation to spread their wings quite literally with more than half the films made beyond the city limits, in the wilds of Scotland.
As always, the work is wide-ranging, but a common thread runs through many of the projects — where the epic collides with the intimate and sweeping landscapes frame tender moments of personal connection.
There is something deeply collaborative and process-driven about this project: a shared appetite for creative risk, bold exploration, and the joy of diving in together feet first.
As you watch these films, our students are already immersed in rehearsals for their final projects of the MA.
These live theatre productions of Orlando , Feelgood and Mr Burns, a Post-Electric Play represent an opportunity for our three directing students to stage contemporary plays featuring the acting students.
All the shows will take place in the Chandler Studio Theatre from 3 to 6 September in rep.
We would all love to see you there.
I hope you enjoy your journey through On the Verge 2025.

When Donn’s car breaks down, he finds meaningful connection that puts his mental health in perspective.
Hermes seeks reason.
Sassandra seeks liberation.
Their journeys of difference end in simulacrum.
The morning after another hard night of partying, two girls contemplate the course of their lives and are forced to confront their past.
Moments before Maya and Tessa scatter their father’s ashes on a hill in Loch Lomond, the sisters navigate love, loss and the climate crisis in the claustrophobia of their stationary car.
In a chance encounter with an enigmatic figure in the wild, a solitary woman explores the joys and perils of encountering the unfamiliar.
On The Verge has been part of the RCS performance calendar for over 10 years, during which time many of the artists have gone on to tour their work nationally and beyond.
Our 2025 edition of On The Verge will take place in August 2025 and will be entirely digital, available to view on this page.
The work is wide-ranging, exploring stories, ideas and questions from the deeply personal to the socio-political and beyond.

Johann Sebastian Bach may never have actually visited Italy but he certainly made the journey in music.
An avid consumer and transcriber of his Italian colleagues, he borrowed their music as themes for fugues or took up their musical ideas to structure his own compositions.
This concert brings his voracious interest to life as glittering and heart-breaking Italian concertos for strings set the stage for Bach’s Double, which invites sinuous virtuosity and exquisite tenderness from two of Dunedin’s finest.

Part of Big Guitar Weekend Fridays at One
Richard Iznaola Los Caprichos de Alany
Laura Husbands & Jonathan Leathwood Guitar
These twenty-six miniatures are somewhat whimsical vignettes in all keys, featuring a variety of technical procedures and expressive approaches for one and two guitars.
They are modeled after historical styles, particular composers, forms and genres associated with specific geographical locations or cultural traditions.
They are preceded by epigraphs by many authors, literary preambles ranging in nature from the descriptive and factual to the poetic, to be read before each piece is performed.
The caprichos are the musical component of a larger work.
As Jonathan Leathwood describes it in his foreword to the book, “This is the second volume of a larger exploration of guitar virtuosity, Summa Kitharologica.
In the first volume, the focus is on the physical mechanics of guitar technique.
But as the title suggests, with its playful allusion to the comprehensive theology of Aquinas, there is more than detailed information about those mechanical matters; there are hints on how to transcend them.
It is that transcendent, childlike spirit that finds its full expression in this second volume.”

During this intensive five-day musical theatre course students will learn how to select appropriate audition pieces that are suited to their strengths as a performer.
Students will work closely with tutors on developing their skills in acting, voice and dance, as well as engage in ensemble work to further develop improvisational skills that may be needed at an audition.
Once you have selected a variety of songs and monologues to work on throughout the course, you will look at the process of researching and interpreting them for audition.
The process of preparing your pieces will challenge you to deepen your understanding of the material you are working with and refine your performance skills.
The week will conclude with a mock audition which closely resembles the experience of auditioning for full-time vocational musical theatre courses.
Please bring the sheet music for at least two contrasting songs, one contemporary Musical Theatre song (either up-tempo or ballad) and one song either written before 1960 or in another style (pop, folk, rock, blues, jazz, gospel).
The course leaders will want to look at contrasts in style, vocal choices, repertoire, and character choices that suit you so bring repertoire that you have worked on previously.
Please also bring two monologues to work on, one contemporary and one Shakespeare.
You will be using these choices as the basis of discussion and development throughout the week so they do not need to be polished performance pieces at this stage.
Students should also bring a bottle of water to ensure they stay hydrated during class.
Please also bring a notepad and pencil to take notes during the course.
You should wear loose, comfortable clothing, suitable for a rehearsal environment, specifically trousers and shoes suitable for dance work given the nature of your course.
Students are advised to avoid jeans, skirts and items of jewellery.

Why Learn Performance in Action?
All storytelling requires high stakes – things matter most when the obstacles seem impossible to overcome.
When the stakes are highest and words fail, action delivers the climax to many of our most popular stories, across both ancient and modern mythologies.
From Shakespeare to the MCU and beyond, physical confrontation brings things to their epic conclusion.
The skills to perform action safely, with intention, and with awareness of the audience’s experience, give those from different worlds a way to stretch their skills in new ways.
Martial artists will learn performance techniques that help audiences follow the story and feel the emotional impact as well as the physical.
Actors will learn how to convey intention through technique.
Everyone will be pushed to expand their toolkit and dig deeper into their disciplines.

Its ground-breaking work is rooted in the work of Nadine George, ( Voice Studio International ) our first International Fellow in Voice, adapted in response to professional performance contexts.
At the heart of the Centre’s work is the uniqueness of each human voice, the centrality of voice to performance and voice’s innovative integration into the theatre/performance-making process itself.
The Centre’s pioneering practice is now well-established in the current theatre voice context through significant partnerships with, amongst others, the National Theatre of Scotland, the Traverse Theatre and Dundee Repertory Theatre.
Staff from the Centre teach this cutting-edge vocal practice on the School’s undergraduate and postgraduate performance programmes and are also engaged in the research and development of the work in conjunction with professional actors, directors, movement specialists and contemporary performance practitioners, ensuring a conduit of innovative practice between training and the profession.
Head of Voice (School of Dance, Drama, Production and Film) and Centre for Voice in Performance: Jean Sangster
‘The continuous individual feedback in each class is invaluable as it is thorough and concise and therefore helpful in identifying and summarising what to take from each experience.’
‘Every one of us was complimented and given an individual task to go away with.
I’ve rarely, if ever, experienced that individual attention in this kind of setting before.
‘I feel I now have a richer understanding of my voice, and how I can use it fully to communicate mood, emotion, character qualities and situation.’
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland was the first conservatoire in the UK to introduce the vocal practice of Nadine George into its voice curriculum over twenty years ago.
When we established our Centre for Voice in Performance in 2006, this voice work became the central approach to voice studies in the School of Drama.
Whether those texts are conventionally written or found or devised, whether poetry, prose or drama, whether classical or the latest in new writing, the challenge of investigating them physically and imaginatively in order to communicate them to others demands everything of the speaker.
Additionally, on some programmes, students study singing, dialects and Scots language for Scots and non-Scots alike.
Within Musical Theatre programmes, the Centre is spearheading the unique relationship between its spoken practice and the various singing styles of musical theatre, to produce a distinctive training for our students.
Particular emphasis is laid on daily practice and the need for students to be independent learners taking responsibility for the development of their own voices and their individual vocal learning journeys.
Centre staff continue to work on their own voices using George’s work.
They also regularly train together as a staff team, occasionally joined by performance colleagues, ensuring an integration of disciplines for staff and students alike.
‘These lessons have really helped me explore my voice, and realise how much more potential it has I thought you were just born with it, and learned ”˜to project’.’
‘I was amazed at how different placements really do change how we feel and how we are.
It’s also lovely to see the rest of the class explore what they can do and see how they change and develop.’
‘I was so surprised at how full my voice actually is.
I was quite overwhelmed by the power that came out but also excited to know that there is this deeper level that I am free to develop and explore.’

Visiting Voice Teachers
It is over 25 years since the vocal practice of Dr Nadine George of Voice Studio International was introduced to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and Scottish theatre.
The work was then developed and researched within performance training and professional theatre productions where it had a significant impact on rehearsal performance practice, the role of the voice specialist in production and on the application of the vocal work to directors, the direction process, and new writing.
The work became the core vocal practice of the Conservatoire in 2006, when Professor Ros Steen established the Centre for Voice in Performance.
Growing Voices charts the growth and development of the work’s impact on training and the profession through a range of responses from directors, voice practitioners, playwrights, actors, staff and students, who speak in their individual voices about their relationship to the work.
This first publication from the Centre for Voice in Performance is a testament to the profound impact of Nadine George and her method:
‘…the technique opened a whole new thing which has been amazing – the voice, the communication, the vibration and resonance and the energies.’
John Tiffany, Director ( Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , Black Watch, Once)

The Centre’s published research includes:
The impact of Ros Steen ’s practice-based research on the voice in theatre can be seen in the National Theatre of Scotland’s productions Black Watch and Macbeth.
Steen’s research at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland takes as its starting point the voice work of Alfred Wolfsohn, Roy Hart and Nadine George, placing the unique connection of the individual’s voice to the self at the centre of the creative process in production.
Her research, which has been developed since 1997 and is unique in theatre, ensures a visceral and transformative experience for performers and audiences alike.
The impact of her work is felt within individual productions; in their critical reception; and in the development in Scotland of an integrated community of practice embracing writers, actors and directors a positive creative ecology that has helped to radicalise views of what is possible in the theatre.
Cummings’s grasp of the poetry [of Macbeth] is so complete, and his raw emotional immersion in it is so total, that the audience remains absolutely gripped by the narrative; and unable to resist the sense of being pulled by the story towards the very brink of hell”¦ (The Scotsman 16/6/13, Joyce McMillan)
If the whole thing was disbanded tomorrow, [Black Watch] would ensure the National Theatre of Scotland’s place not just in the history of Scottish theatre but theatre everywhere.
(The Times, 2010).

Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate Taught (PGT) programmes at RCS are applied for through UCAS Conservatoires or UCAS (except BA Performance for Deaf and HoH actors ).
The below table lists each of our UG and PGT programmes and where each should be applied for alongside their application deadlines.

The UCAS application fee is currently £28.95 (this is in addition to the audition fee which differs between courses and is listed on the programme page), which allows up to six choices of programme of study.
The audition fee charge allows us to offer a thorough and positive experience to all applicants and we encourage you to ask the panel questions and find out more about the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to see if it is the best fit for you.
In support of this, audition fee waivers are offered to undergraduate applicants whose financial hardship may be a barrier to auditioning.

Our admissions processes are designed to be fair, transparent, and efficient.
The audition/interview approach serves the dual nature of allowing the panel to assess first-hand an applicant’s suitability for their chosen programme and it also affords the applicant the opportunity to gain a deeper insight into the nature of that programme and the opportunities offered by the RCS.
In arriving at its recommendation, the audition/interview panel will take account of all aspects of the applicant’s profile i.e.:
We welcome applications from individuals whose academic qualifications or English language qualifications do not match (in terms of equivalence) or fall short of the normal entrance requirements, where specified*.
Having satisfied the Audition Panel that they meet the selection criteria and demonstrated that they have the capacity to pursue the proposed course of study, such applicants will be considered through examination of contextualised data provided in accordance with the Non-Standard Entry Policy.
* Note that UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) imposes minimum English Language requirements in respect of international applicants who require a Student Visa to study in the UK.
RCS welcomes applications from mature students, i.e.
students over the age of 21 at entry to the programme.
Whilst the selection procedures will still be applied, consideration will be given to appropriate artistic experience not normally expected in school leavers, which is deemed to compensate for any lack of traditional entrance qualifications.
Successful mature applicants, as for all other applicants, must convince auditioning panels that they have the ability and potential to cope with the demands of the programme.
Their progress, especially in the early stages of the programme, will be closely monitored and appropriate advice and support given.
All decisions will be posted on UCAS Conservatoires/UCAS Undergraduate following your audition via UCAS Track (you will need your username and password to log-in).
You will also receive notification from UCAS when decisions on all your choices are available.
Explanation of UCAS Conservatoires codes – https://www.ucas.com/conservatoires/replying-your-offers/decisions-your-ucas-conservatoires-application
UCAS Undergraduate – https://www.ucas.com/applying/after-you-apply/types-of-undergraduate-offers
As soon as a decision is made, UCAS Conservatoires/UCAS Undergraduate will let you know.
You must reply to your offer online via UCAS Track by the reply date displayed on your Track.
If you do not reply by the date given, your offers will be declined automatically by UCAS.
The reply date may be different to other applicants as it is based on when you receive your last decision.

If you make an application through UCAS Conservatoires, UCAS or UCAS Teacher Training, you cannot hold more than one confirmed place.
A confirmed place in UCAS Conservatoires is a guaranteed unconditional offer as your first choice (GU1) and in UCAS and UCAS Teacher Training it is an unconditional firm (UF) place.
If you receive more than one confirmed place, UCAS will ask you to accept one offer and withdraw from any others.
If you have received a ‘reserve’ outcome, it means that RCS is not able to offer you a guaranteed place at the time of making our decision.
A ‘reserve’ outcome indicates that RCS would like the opportunity to review its outcome to you in the light of acceptances/declines to its guaranteed offers.
You will become part of a ‘pool’ of ‘reserve’ candidates and RCS may choose to make you a guaranteed offer if a suitable place becomes available.
Reserve does not mean that a place has been ‘reserved’ for you.
If RCS chooses not to make you a guaranteed offer, you will not have a place to start at RCS.
If you have been given a ‘reserve’ outcome, in order to be considered for a guaranteed place (should one become available) you will need to accept the outcome (and meet any conditions if applicable).
Reserve outcomes remain active until the end of August.
The decision to wait and see whether a guaranteed place becomes available, or to accept an offer at another conservatoire is entirely at your discretion.
As soon as your situation changes, this is updated on UCAS Conservatoires.

December 17, 2020
Playing guitar, learning Italian and discovering a new-found appreciation for jogging…they’re just a few things that defined lockdown for Edinburgh-born actor Emun Elliott.
Oh, and there’s landing a major new movie role too.
The BA Acting graduate, whose credits include Black Watch, Star Wars, Guilt and Game of Thrones, talks to Linda Robertson about life at RCS, his new film releases and shares words of wisdom with the next generation.
When coronavirus brought the film, theatre and TV industry to a halt this year, Emun Elliott, like many of his fellow actors, watched as productions hit pause.
Cameras stopped rolling.
Stages fell dark.
Schedules were suddenly clear.
He certainly didn’t expect to find himself cast in a major new movie during lockdown.
“It was quite a weird experience after sitting around for months thinking everything’s over,” says Emun, talking from his home in London.
“I had sent off a self-tape to my American rep, something you do if you can’t make an audition.
I got a call saying that writer and director M.
Night Shyamalan wants to FaceTime.”
“We sat and chatted for an hour which was surreal because out of nowhere, and after thinking the industry is done for, for a while, suddenly we’re talking about the potential of this new and exciting project.
I’m thrilled to be working with another highly acclaimed, bold and adventurous film director.”
Emun will star alongside Gael García Bernal, Eliza Scanlen, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Rufus Sewell and Ken Leung in Old , scheduled for release in summer next year.
While the plot is under wraps, it’s said to be inspired by the French graphic novel Sandcastle .
While Emun can’t give anything away about Old , he can talk about two of his most recent roles.
There’s the gripping, psychological Repression , shot in Scotland and Luxembourg, that tells the story of a therapist who loses her grip on reality when a ten-year-old boy claims he can control her future.
“It stars Thekla Reuten, who is an actor I’ve loved for years, Bill Paterson and Peter Mullan – it’s good to be in such fine company,” he says.
“It’s dark, beautifully shot and very creepy.
The script was one of the most complicated, high-concept things I’d ever read.”
Emun will also be seen on screen in the Orpheus-inspired Phea by Rocky Palladino, currently in post-production, and Walking to Paris , from arthouse director Peter Greenaway.
The ambitious and highly anticipated Walking to Paris was shot over five years and is Emun’s first lead in a feature film.
He portrays the real-life sculptor Constantin Brâncuși who, in 1903 and 1904, walked from Bucharest to Paris.
“It took him a year-and-a-half and shows how that journey informed his work.
He went on to become one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th century.
“It’s very visual and classical and full of nudity and experimentation.
I thought, if I’m going to do something crazy, Peter is the one to do it with.
His films are masterpieces and every single frame looks like a beautiful painting.
The things he asked me to do on camera, I’d never dream of doing with anyone else.
I’m really excited to see it.”
What draws him to a role?
“Sometimes you read a script and you know you have to do it, you almost become attached to it immediately.
Other times you’ll respond to something because you don’t know how to do it and you’re interested in figuring a way through it – you’re more focused on the challenge of doing it than the outcome.”
And he admits, some roles can take a bit of convincing: “A lot of the time other people can see things in you that you don’t necessarily recognise yourself.
What excites me most is always the challenge – feeling like I’m right for something but not really knowing how I’m going to execute it.
It’s that knife-edge that so many creatives walk and it’s definitely part of the thrill.
Sometimes it will lead to failure but it’s a risk that you have to take.”
Emun isn’t afraid to take risks, an approach that led him to swap the world of academia for acting, after he realised that university life wasn’t for him.
“That’s a nice way of saying I dropped out,” he laughs.
“I went to Aberdeen University to study English and French and switched to English and film before dropping out.
“I loved doing school plays and drama was my thing but it wasn’t on the curriculum.
When I was about to leave school, I told the head of my year that I wanted to become an actor and was advised to rethink that and go to university like everyone else.”
His parents told him to make sure he didn’t get stuck in a job he wasn’t passionate about: “I used it to pursue the thing I really loved.
I auditioned for RCS when it was known as the RSAMD (Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama) when I was 17 and I remember thinking that if I didn’t get in, I’d audition to be an entertainer on a cruise ship and go around the world doing that.”
He didn’t need to find his sea legs as he was accepted to the three-year BA Acting programme.
“I had the best time at RCS but I never really knew what I was in for!
I was doing the thing I enjoyed at school and what I was told I was good at.
I thought I’d learn to be an entertainer and I realised in my first year that while it can be that, there’s also this whole other side to it and you can push it and take it in whatever direction you like.
“It’s this vast, complicated craft and there were all these ideas and techniques thrown at us and these beautiful, different ways of approaching them – something I really underestimated.
“I remember feeling very overwhelmed, like ‘I don’t understand this and don’t know how to employ it, does that mean I’m not a good actor?’.
I became obsessive about what this thing was, what made something believable, and it became this big labyrinth of discovery.”
He felt like the ‘dark horse’ in those first twelve months but credits RCS for building his confidence, from his teachers and guest artists to fellow students.
“It’s something I definitely learned.
I’m naturally quite shy, which is one of the reasons I like acting, it gives me the excuse to say someone else’s words and be an extrovert, and be under the umbrella of someone else.
“I always felt like I was playing catch-up in first year but the opportunities we were given made sure that everyone got the chance to play a leading role or take a part of some significance.”
If he could give young Emun advice, what would he tell him?
“Don’t beat yourself up about a comment someone made in rehearsal, a bad review or not feeling particularly ‘on it’ in a performance.
Have the ability to let go and move forward and don’t get stuck in the past.
When you’re younger, you sometimes think that you need to be this deep and tortured artist having a terrible time to deliver these great performances.
Take all that with a huge pinch of salt.”
He says drama school gave him everything he needed to grow as an actor: “The great thing about the RCS was the variety in terms of what we were able to explore and the diversity of people brought in for workshops.
There was also a real sense of camaraderie and support with other pupils, we very much felt like we were all in it together.
“When you start working professionally, whether it’s rehearsing a play or going on to a film set, you become part of this new family for a while and RCS was integral in preparing us for that.”
Emun graduated in 2005 and has worked consistently ever since across film, theatre, television and radio.
His first TV role was in Scottish drama Monarch of the Glen and he has appeared in shows including Game of Thrones , Lip Servic e , Vera , Trust Me , Clique , Threesome and The Paradise .
He will return to TV screens in the BBC series Guilt , which is currently shooting its second series.
On the film front, he has worked with legendary director Ridley Scott twice on Prometheus and Exodus , joined Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens and starred in Irvine Welsh’s Filth with fellow BA Acting alumnus James McAvoy.
He was also part of the original cast of the National Theatre of Scotland’s celebrated global smash Black Watch , which holds special memories and felt like a ‘turning point’.
Based on interviews with soldiers from the Scottish regiment about their experiences in Iraq, the play performed to sold-out audiences and earned rave reviews.
“It had such a phenomenal response and I feel so lucky to have been part of a play that people still talk about today.
It felt like it opened a lot of doors for me, it took me to New York and all over the world, and on the back of it I got an American agent.”
He loves the immediacy of theatre, being on stage in front of an audience night after night.
“No-one is filming or editing and what you decide to do on stage is what people will see.
“I love rehearsing and exploring the possibilities of the material.
Theatre feels closer to the reason why I decided to do this in the first place.
Also, when you do a play, the relationships with your cast members are different as you spend more time together.”
So how does he feel about the current state of play in theatre, with arts and culture taking a massive hit from the pandemic?
“Actors, artists, are used to challenges so I feel hopeful about the future of live performance.
Theatre will survive, it will go on but it needs audiences.
In terms of TV and film, it’s easier because of the stop-start nature of these productions and camera trickery can be used to get around Covid-centric obstacles.”
The last time Emun set foot on stage was in New York for his Broadway debut in Tennessee Williams’ The Rose Tattoo , alongside Oscar-winning actor Marisa Tomei.
“It was great to be able to tick that box, it feels like Broadway is at the peak of the theatrical world.
It was wonderful to play opposite Marisa Tomei, an Oscar-winning Italian-American actor, and to try to convince a New York audience that I was Italian.
I loved the challenge of that.
“Working in New York and being part of the energy of the city was amazing.
I spent the best part of six months there, performing eight times a week.
I finished up before Christmas, came back home, took January off and was gearing up for everything again when the industry came grinding to a halt.
I had a couple of things lined up which were put on hold.
It’s a relief that things are happening again.”
Emun spent the first month of lockdown at home in Edinburgh.
“We had that glorious sunshine, that doesn’t even happen in summer time!
It was almost like nature’s response, thanking us for slowing down and I felt that everything would be beautiful and brighter.
The longer it went on, the harder it was to cling on to that optimism and spirituality,” he laughs.
“It has been a mad rollercoaster from one extreme to the other.”
How did he approach lockdown life – did he acquire any new skills, start baking banana bread, take part in Zoom quizzes?
“I did fall into that lockdown cliché!
I started learning Italian and played the guitar more than usual.
I also started jogging, which I’ve never done in my life and always turned my nose up at the idea of it but lo and behold, I’ve become one of ‘them’!
It helped build a bit of structure although as an actor, you learn the importance of being disciplined with your days in downtime.”
His advice for actors right now, especially those who have just graduated and are following in his footsteps, is ‘to keep staying positive (and testing negative!).’
“First, congratulations on getting this far, in deciding to pursue your passion and getting into drama school.
I know it has been a strange year but you’ve completed three years of training so don’t be disheartened by what may feel like an uphill climb in getting a foot in the industry.
Just persevere and keep going – there will be light at the end of the tunnel.
And believe in yourself, don’t forget the reason why you’re doing it in the first place.”

Me?!

Creating the world you see on stage is all down to the magic and talent of artists like Lu Herbert.
Set designer Lu, who is in her third year of the Production Arts and Design undergraduate programme , specialises in devising stunning sets that are hallmarks of RCS productions.
Our Production students are working hard to continue their learning online and, when possible, on campus under strict Covid protocols.
Not only is Lu designing for forthcoming shows including the musical The Pyjama Game , she is also associate designer for British Youth Music Theatre’s Why the Whales Came , which is staged later this year.
A.
It was last February, just before lockdown, when I was going through different companies and looking for something I would really resonate with as part of my third-year placement.
Having gone to a youth theatre myself, I know how valuable arts education groups such as BYMT are to young people around the UK.
I applied for an interview to be considered as the associate designer to the company (meaning I would be designing my own show with them).
I got the position as the designer for their musical adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s novel Why the Whales Came, which will be staged in Plymouth.
It’s my first professional design job and I’ll be spending a few weeks down there designing a set and costumes for the show to be performed in August.
It’s such a fantastic position and I’m really looking forward to it.
I love the values of the company and their previous works, so I’m looking forward to putting my stamp on such a well-loved children’s book and making it into a fab musical experience for all ages.
I’m the designer for the musical The Pyjama Game in term three, performed by final year BA Musical Theatre students, which has been an absolute delight to work on.
The colour palettes and costumes are rich and vibrant and the set itself has a nice warmth that’s enhanced by the cast bringing so much life and modern flair to the characters.
It’s set in a factory, so there’s a sense of industrial design with exposed brickwork, copper piping and 1950s signage alongside really fun costumes in a stylised, playful interpretation of the fifties fashion.
When it was presented to the actors, they were so excited about everything.
I can’t wait to see it.
I’m also working on the third year BA Acting production How to Disappear Completely and Never be Found .
That moment before the curtain rises, when everyone’s waiting … I love it!
It’s so satisfying to see the set and to hear people talk about it afterwards, and the elements that they liked.
I try to get to as many rehearsals and meetings as possible to see the set going through its process.
When it’s on the stage on opening night, you think ‘I did that!’
MacGregor and MacDuff was an amazing experience.
I loved working with the company to create the vision they were looking for.
They pitched the concept of ‘handcrafted, high quality and heritage’ and I came up with a window display inspired by their Scottish heritage and the colour palette from their Arran Mist tartan.
The project was self-led, so I got a team of other Production Arts and Design students on board to be my prop makers and scenic artist.
The collaboration with MacGregor and MacDuff was so rewarding, and the window display at their Bath Street store was in place for several weeks.
It was lovely to work with a professional company on a window display.
The end result was a beautiful backdrop of trees and misty mountains with flecks of snow dusting the trees.
The props at either side were intricate sewing tools – embroidery scissors, a needle and thimble – with the Arran Mist tartan at the centre, in an outfit chosen by MacGregor and MacDuff.
It was surreal seeing my work in a shop window.
It was on the street, in real life, with people walking past it every day.

In my second year of study, my lecturer asked if I’d considered doing costume design and said they’d support me if I wanted to try it out.

Rhys talks to us about how important lighting is to the process of telling a story on stage, what made his life happier and reveals his ambition to work with an international rock band!

From this, I gained an amazing insight into how lighting can convey a real sense of magic and wonder to the audience.
I always want to be part of the story being told on the stage, and if I can create something that makes people say ‘wow’ and draws them in further, then that’s a win in my mind!
I think that everyone has a certain way that they work best and finding your way will make life easier and happier in the long run.
Also, people don’t care why it’s broken…they care that you haven’t fixed it yet!
So always come with solutions and work smart.
I would love to be designing lighting rigs for big bands like Gorillaz or Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The lighting designs on these big productions have inspired me as an audience member, and to be working on something like that would be my dream come true.
That it doesn’t really matter what level you are, this is a place to learn and grow as a technician.
Be ready to work hard but remember that this is the best place to learn.

December 3, 2019
With two major movies in the bag this year and singled out by Variety as ‘one to watch’, screenwriter and graduate Krysty Wilson-Cairns is shooting for the top, as Dr Andy Dougan, RCS Film lecturer, finds out.
Being blacklisted is normally the kiss of death in any industry but it turned out to be the key to big screen success for alumna Krysty Wilson-Cairns.
Krysty graduated from the former BA Honours programme in Digital Film and Television in 2009.
Now, ten years later, she is the toast of Hollywood.
She has co-written two major films this year alone.
1917 , a First World War film shot partly in Glasgow, was a collaboration with Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes.
This overlapped with Last Night in Soho , which she co-wrote with acclaimed director Edgar Wright.
But all of this traces back to 2014 when her sci-fi script Aether was named in The Black List, the Hollywood list of the best unproduced scripts of the year.
There were 70 scripts on the list that year but Aether was in the top ten.
This was the calling card which started opening doors and led to Krysty taking important meetings with high flyers on both sides of the Atlantic.
“It took my career out of the UK, where I would have always struggled,” she says.
“I was writing big budget high concept movies – and they aren’t often made here, and certainly not by unknown, untested, young female writers.”
The script was read by John Logan, the man who wrote Gladiator and Skyfall , and on the strength of it, he hired her as a writer on the TV series Penny Dreadful , which Sam Mendes’ company produced, so it brought her to his attention too.
“I have so much love for that script,” she admits of Aether , “even though when I read it now I cringe because I would change so much of it.”
Aether also landed her that elusive first paid feature commission, The Good Nurse for Darren Aronofsky.
“I do feel like I’m playing in the big leagues now, mostly because sometimes I’d be at dinner with the 1917 crew and I’d be the only one at the table without an Oscar,” she laughs.
But having made it this far, Krysty is well aware that the trick is to stay there.
However having two major films not only shooting back to back but overlapping, suggests she may be doing something right.
And, she admits, so much of what she has become stems from her time here at RCS.
“RCS didn’t just prepare me for my career, studying there opened my eyes and showed me what my career could be.
It gave me my career — I had no idea I wanted to, or in fact even could be, a screenwriter before I was set that first writing task for the class.
That was the ‘eureka’ moment for me, I was shocked that this could be a job, because it never felt like work.
“I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the History of Cinema lessons,” she continues.
“An education in filmmaking is so much more than ‘here’s a camera and here’s how it works’.
It’s about learning a craft of course, but it’s also about learning its history.
“Being pushed out of my regular viewing comfort zone, being forced to evaluate my own taste in films and TV; that really opened my world up.
And it started a passion for older films and things out of the mainstream that has really served me well over the years.
“The best thing about those classes was that there was no dismissing of the mainstream, there was no belittling it.
And I think that’s an important thing that many other courses lack.
I was never made to feel stupid for loving Charlie’s Angels II: Full Throttle .”
Krysty’s studies at RCS not only expanded her cultural horizons, but also gave her a sense of confidence in her own tastes and an ability to think critically about them.
“The RCS prepared me not only as a technician, but as a scholar and a connoisseur,” she says.
“It gave me the tools to understand the kinds of films and shows I want to make, not just how to make them, which in my opinion is more important.”
And what of those who want to follow in her footsteps?
For Krysty there are three key words; listen, collaborate and finish.
“If you want to be a writer, nothing will serve you better than listening.
Listen to everyone.
To the people you work with, to those who hire you, to your collaborators, to the runners.
They all have something of value to you,” she explains.
“And learn how to collaborate.
If you can’t be a good collaborator, save yourself a huge amount of headache and heartache and do something else.
“Also, if you want to be a serious writer, you have to be a finisher.
You can have a thousand ideas, but if you don’t have one finished script, you don’t have anything.”
With success beckoning, Krysty’s life continues to be dominated by lists.
She’s just been named on another one, this time from Variety – the film industry bible – which has included her on their annual ‘10 Screenwriters to Watch’ event at the prestigious Mill Valley film festival.
“There’s so much more work to do, so many more stories I want to write and TV shows I want to make,” says Krysty thoughtfully.
“I feel like I’ve been really lucky to make the team, but I want a long career, I want to stay in the big leagues and be competitive.
The only way to do that is to keep working.”

Composer Bekah Simms hails from St.
John’s, Newfoundland and is currently based in Glasgow after nine years living and working in Toronto.
Her varied musical output has been heralded as “cacophonous, jarring, oppressive — and totally engrossing!” ( CBC Music ), “tough, even gutsy…with a sure sense of original and vibrant colours” ( Vancouver Sun ), and lauded for its “sheer range of ingenious material, expressive range and sonic complexity” ( The Journal of Music .)

Recent interests in just intonation and virtual instruments have resulted in increasingly lush and strange harmonic environments.
Bekah’s music has been widely performed across North America and Europe.
She has worked with some of the top interpreters of contemporary music internationally, including Crash Ensemble – with whom she is currently an artist-in-residence – Riot Ensemble, Eighth Blackbird, and l’Ensemble Contemporain de Montréal.

During my graduate year in BA Modern Ballet, I joined Scottish Ballet as a Guest Artist for the Wee Hansel and Gretel and Cinderella winter tour 2018/19.
During this time, I was selected as one of the top five ballet finalists in the televised national dance competition, BBC Young Dancer 2019.
Following my graduation, I worked with Ballet Cymru, dancing the role of Juliet in Romeo and Juliet , touring the UK, China, Bermuda and New York.
I later joined the Baltic Opera Ballet of Gdańsk in 2020, dancing numerous soloist roles until 2023.
I then returned to Glasgow to join Scottish Ballet as an Artist, performing in productions including Cinders!
and David Dawson’s Swan Lake .
I’m currently rehearsing for the new Nutcracker which is in theatres from winter 2024.
What sparked your love for ballet?
I can’t remember a time that dance hasn’t been present in my life.
My mum took me to watch my very first ballet at four years old, it was Scottish Ballet’s Nutcracker, and I was mesmerised straight away.
I took up ballet seriously at 12 years old at my local dance school.
That’s when I really fell in love with the art form, and it has been present in my life every single day since then.

What was it like studying at RCS?
I remember my time at RCS was full of hard work, because let’s be real: ballet is really hard.
The years at RCS completely flew by, always being a treasured chapter of my life to look back on.
How did your time at RCS prepare you for the world of work?
Throughout my time at RCS I developed, grew, learnt and experienced so much.
I had plenty of performing opportunities and gained experience on-stage but also off-stage, as a dancer but also as a person.
RCS was also key to understanding professionalism, moulding me as a student into a professional dancer.
What have been some of your career highlights?
A career highlight of mine has been able to perform David Dawson’s Swan Lake .
It was a dream of mine to perform this ballet and I have been very lucky to tick it off my bucket list.
I love this production because it really celebrates the corps de ballet at its best – every swan poured their heart and soul into each show.
Such a challenging yet inspiring ballet, being the most rewarding experience so far in my career.
Any words of wisdom for those looking to pursue a career in ballet?
Hard work will always pay off, not necessarily in the way you expect, but be patient and confident that your time will come.
What’s next for you?
To keep growing and learning.
When we stop being curious about our art, that’s when we lose the passion.
To keep caring and remembering why we started as dancers is vital for the profession, remember the spark and keep it alive.

June 13, 2020
Since its inception in 2009, the BA Modern Ballet degree at the Royal Conservatoire has grown to become one of the UK’s most respected dance training programmes.
And there has been much to celebrate in that time, as Linda Robertson discovers.
Performing for royalty at Buckingham Palace, touring Scotland with an internationally acclaimed company, a cool Celtic Connections gig and a global sporting event, there have been many show-stopping moments for dancers of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
Students of this three-year ballet degree programme, designed and delivered in partnership with Scottish Ballet , have taken part in a whirl of high-profile and once-in-a-lifetime events and all before they’ve even dipped a toe in the professional world.
“We’ve had so many amazing highlights,” says Kerry Livingstone, Head of the BA Modern Ballet programme.
“Students have danced at Buckingham Palace, the Royal Opera House and on film and television, while our graduates have taken up positions in companies including Scottish Ballet, National Ballet of Portugal, Northern Ballet and Ballet Cymru, and three have joined Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures in two years.”
The partnership with Scottish Ballet offers invaluable insight and experience into company life.
It brings exclusive performance opportunities, too.
In September 2018, third year students set off on a Scotland-wide tour with Scottish Ballet’s Wee Hansel & Gretel , a ‘wee version of a big ballet’.
It was such a hit, it continued again the following year, with a new cohort travelling across the country.
“What the dancers learned by working alongside the company is unique in terms of ballet training in the UK,” says Kerry.
“Individual students often get opportunities but the third year cohorts were involved over two years.
Christopher Hampson, Scottish Ballet’s Artistic Director and CEO, adapted his full-length Hansel & Gretel for this production so the first cohort of students spent three days in the studio with him at Scottish Ballet while it was being re-choreographed.
To see that process, and to be in the studio with him, was an incredible experience.
“To tour as part of a professional company, before graduating, is rare.
The dancers deeply appreciated the experience being immersed in that environment, as they approached graduation and were preparing to audition, was invaluable.”
In December 2018, four third year students toured with Scottish Ballet’s Cinderella and in January 2019, company soloist Jamiel Laurence choreographed a new piece for the second years, a ten-minute work, Young Edmund , that they performed on stage with folk artist Jarlath Henderson at Glasgow’s City Halls as part of Celtic Connections.
Dancers were also involved in Jamiel’s short film Flight for BBC Arts’ Dance Passion season, which involved 43 dancers, one staircase, one smartphone and one take at BBC Scotland’s Glasgow HQ.
“We regularly work with guest artists and the way our curriculum is structured means we can use class time to facilitate any rehearsals” says Kerry.
“We’re responsive to any opportunities that come up because we recognise how beneficial they are to the students’ development.”
As the year progressed, the students remained firmly in the spotlight and when two students leapt into the finals of the BBC Young Dancer competition 2019, it sent ripples of excitement through the dance studios and beyond.
Third years Danila Marzilli (below, second left) and Louis Fukuhara (centre) reached the ballet category finals of the nationwide contest, which was televised on BBC Four.
“To have two of the five ballet finalists in BBC Young Dancer 2019 was very exciting and Danila and Louis were terrific ambassadors for the Royal Conservatoire,” says Kerry.
“We were thrilled to see their talents recognised in a nationwide showcase which opened up new performance opportunities for them.
We were all so incredibly proud of them.”
Danila, who is a member of Ballet Cymru , says: “It was incredible and I feel so honoured to have been selected, especially being one of two from Scotland, with Louis and I being in the same year at RCS.
It was an amazing experience and it didn’t even feel like competition between the five finalists, we grew to be really good friends.”
Hot on the contest’s heels was the annual graduation show that perfectly illustrated the strength of this three-year degree programme a blend of classical repertoire and powerful contemporary pieces, created by some of the dance world’s leading lights.
“Dance that engages with real flair across a spectrum of styles,” noted dance writer Mary Brennan in The Herald .
It included Surveillance by student Rosie Mackley who won the ballet department’s annual choreography competition and later staged the piece at the Royal Opera House.
“We were thrilled when Rosie was selected as part of the Royal Opera House Young Creatives programme, where she was mentored by The Royal Ballet’s Valentino Zucchetti.
Surveillance was performed by six fellow students at the Royal Opera House and the Southbank.”
In June, the ballet students received a very special invitation to perform at Buckingham Palace for the Royal Conservatoire’s Patron, His Royal Highness Prince Charles, The Duke of Rothesay.
“We took the whole cohort of third years to London to perform at a gala dinner for The Prince’s Foundation which was just a lovely and positive experience for them all,” says Kerry.
“They performed alongside our musicians and alumni mezzo-soprano Karen Cargill and conductor Jessica Cottis and actor Sam Heughan and had the most wonderful time.”
And she says the lead-up to the event came with its own magical moment: “We were rehearsing one day with the orchestra and Jessica, and the orchestra had never seen the dancers perform because they’re always in the pit below the stage.
The dancers were in front of them and there was such a great energy in the room and they were feeding off each other.
I won’t forget that.”
The dancers delivered another winning performance when they helped launch one of the world’s biggest golf events.
In September last year, they joined forces with Royal Conservatoire musicians for the opening celebration of international golf showdown, the Solheim Cup.
Graduates, the Broen Ensemble, played live to a video backdrop of ten students dancing in the grounds of Perthshire’s Scone Palace.
To top it all off, graduating students have made some thrilling moves.
Rose Goddard made her professional debut as Nadia in Matthew Bourne’s double Olivier award-winning The Red Shoes .
Rose follows in the footsteps of classmate Louis Fukuhara , who was an original cast member in Bourne’s world premiere of Romeo and Juliet and 2018 grad Keenan Fletcher , who toured the world in the iconic Swan Lake.
Hannah Cubbit (below) and Anna Williams joined Scottish Ballet while Nuno Tauber is with National Ballet of Portugal.
“The graduate destinations over the last few years are a strong representation of the course,” says Kerry.
“Contemporary continues to be really important in what we do and that feels like something that sets us apart from other ballet schools.
We are a ballet programme but the level of contemporary we’re achieving is what’s making our students very appealing to employers because they can do the repertoire that’s required.”
Kerry has been with the programme since the beginning, so what does she hope the next decade will bring?
“We’re really ambitious for the course and we’re constantly moving forward.
We’ll continue to say ‘yes’ to all these amazing opportunities because we see the positive impact they have.
“We’re a great team, all working together for the students, and we’re always excited to see the progress that they make year on year.”

October 30, 2018
Dancer and choreographer Paul Liburd spent a week at RCS to work with the Modern Ballet students on their graduation performance.
Linda Robertson sits in on a class and watches the dance master at work.
The slow, hypnotic beat of a drum fills the room as dancers begin to move – stretching, flexing, contracting – their eyes locked on the teacher ahead.
As he winds his way through the bodies, he gives a word of encouragement here, an adjustment there, while delivering a steady stream of instructions.
This is Paul Liburd MBE, world-respected dancer, choreographer and teacher who is here to work with the students on their technique.
Paul is exacting but fun, his face often breaking into a wide smile as he joins in with the plies and tendus.
The pace soon picks up as the students travel across the floor: “This should be one of the best parts of dancing – filling the space,” Paul says, as he takes flight.
It’s special to get visits like this – guest artists who come to RCS to share their passion and professional practice with the next generation, giving them unique industry insight.
Paul danced with companies including Scottish Ballet – where he was a soloist – Rambert and London Contemporary Dance Theatre, and has performed the works of some of the world’s most prominent contemporary-modern choreographers.
When he retired from performing after an award-winning 24-year career, he moved into teaching and is currently contemporary dance tutor at Rambert School.
He was awarded the MBE in 2009 for services to dance.
Paul teaches Graham-based technique, the contemporary movement style created by dance pioneer Martha Graham.
“Graham is an intense technique but the students have jumped on board with me, which is great, and they’re all working hard.”
What does he hope they’ll take away from it?
“Just being open to this new experience, more than anything.
I always say to myself ‘be a sponge’, take it all in, you may not use it today or tomorrow but you may use it in five years’ time.
A sound technique gives you a foundation to explore many, many things.”
The qualities he looks for in a dancer are passion and an openness to learn and evolve.
