The University of Liverpool is a place where people thrive through inspiring education and innovative research.
We are the original redbrick, a historic part of the city of Liverpool for nearly 150 years and a founding member of the prestigious Russell Group.
Since 1881, our aim has been the same: the advancement of learning and ennoblement of life.
The University of Liverpool was originally founded as University College, Liverpool in 1881.
It officially opened its doors a year later in 1882 to just 45 students, with 6 chair positions and 2 lectureships.
The first college building was located on Ashton Street, which is still at the heart of campus today.
In 1884, the College was admitted as a member of the federal Victoria University in association with colleges in Manchester and Leeds.
From that point, it began to progress rapidly in terms of available equipment and teaching strength.
In the following years, a number of buildings were erected to house large laboratories, funded by gifts from local philanthropists and benefactors.
These laboratories helped to significantly increase the institution’s teaching strength in chemistry, engineering, physiology and pathology.
During the 1890s, 8 more chair positions were endowed, as well as many lectureships and scholarships.
The late 19th century saw one of the major events in the University’s history.
Construction started on our iconic red brick Victoria Building in 1889, designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse.
This would not have been possible without the generous gifts and fundraising from the people of Liverpool.
Sir William Hartley funded the clock and bells for the tower, while Sir Henry Tate funded the entire library block of the building (now the Tate Hall).
The Victoria Building was officially opened in 1892 by Lord Spencer, marking Liverpool as the original redbrick.
During the early 1900s, the College gained confidence and gained substantial respect from the city of Liverpool.
More subject-based schools were established, including a training college for teachers and schools of architecture, commerce, law, public health and tropical medicine.
The establishment of these schools meant the College gained a positive reputation among the intellectuals of the city, as well as showcasing the direct impact of higher education studies to the wider Liverpool community.
As public and city council support for the College grew with increased collaboration, the college began to develop its own distinctive character.
The new century brought about some big changes for Liverpool.
The University as we know it today was established in 1903 following the granting of a royal charter.
Due to the close relationship between the city and the University, we came to be seen as a distinguished institution among British universities.
By 1907, the University was taking shape, structured into 5 faculties.
These were arts, science, medicine, law and engineering.
The Faculty of Arts was the largest, both in the number of students and the number of its endowed chairs.
Our originality was also beginning to thrive due to giving prominence to the study of the arts.
After the royal charter was granted, the University continued its remarkable growth thanks to more generous gifts.
Various new buildings were erected on campus, including the George Holt Physical Laboratory, the William Johnston Laboratory of Medical Research, a new medical school building, laboratories for zoology and electrical engineering, and the first British laboratory of physical chemistry, built by Mr.
E.
K.
Muspratt.
By 1907, there were more than 1,000 students enrolled at the University for the first time.
During this time, a sizeable School of Archaeology was also established.
It would go on to become one of the most respected in the country, with 3 dedicated chair positions and organised expeditions to Egypt, Central America and Asia.
Alongside the School, the Garstang Museum was established by Professor John Garstang.
The early 20th century brought about several notable discoveries and innovations from academics based at the University, which helped to put us on the map.
These included the discovery of the synapse, developments in chemotherapy treatment, physics discoveries and work to eradicate smallpox.
This period cemented the University as a place for making discoveries and where innovation is encouraged, a value we still hold as greatly important to this day.
In 1994, the University of Liverpool became a founding member of the Russell Group , which has gone on to have an incredible impact on the UK’s higher education sector, along with other top-performing UK research-led universities.
The Group brings together 24 leading research-intensive universities to ensure that member universities have optimum conditions to flourish and continue to make social, economic and cultural impacts.
Another notable development in the University’s recent history is the opening of Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in partnership with Xi’an Jiaotong University – a top 10 university in China - in 2006.
XJTLU allows students from both universities to study overseas as part of their degrees, and has grown to become an established, innovative university based in China, offering multiple options for study.
The early 2000s also brought about growth on campus for the University, with building developments including the renovation of the Victoria Gallery and Museum , our original red brick building, which was transformed into a public venue for the local community to enjoy.
Various state-of-the-art teaching laboratories were also opened during this time, extending the University’s abilities in physics, earth sciences, chemistry and archaeology teaching.
The Materials Innovation Factory , built as part of a longstanding partnership with Unilever, opened in 2018, and has been an important centre of research innovation and partnerships ever since.
During 2020, the University played an influential role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our laboratories helped us understand how the virus affected people, we helped to map the spread of disease, as well as assessing how testing should be rolled out.
Our expertise in this area helped in establishing the globally-connected Pandemic Institute in 2021.
The University of Liverpool is now organised into 3 faculties with 35 departments and schools.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct (PDF, 220KB) is an indication of our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains.
This document is issued to high-risk suppliers via the tendering process; and will be introduced through the wider supply chain network to medium, and low risk suppliers.
The risks associated with a particular category can be determined by a number of factors, including but not limited to:
We actively review our standard contract terms and conditions to ensure compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
The University’s Procurement Department is responsible for identifying, monitoring, and mitigating areas of potential risk, including the risk of slavery and human trafficking.
Tender documents and contracts include our standards on protecting human rights in the supply chain to ensure suppliers are aware of our requirements.
We have introduced the sector wide NETpositive Supplier Engagement tool, to record supplier sustainability activities, including actions taken by suppliers to identify and eliminate modern slavery in their supply chains.
We will build on the progress we have made so far and have signalled some of our planned areas of focus in this Statement.
Listed below are specific actions for 2023-24 and beyond:
The University is a member of the North Western Universities Procurement Consortium (NWUPC) , which in turn is part of a wider network of consortia covering higher education across the UK.
Together, the purchasing consortia have agreed a shared Sustainability Policy to which all consortia are committed.
This policy includes steps that form part of the supplier selection process for the major collaborative framework procurements that are conducted on behalf of consortium members, part of this selection process is aimed at ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within the supply chain.
Approximately c30% of the University's non-pay expenditure is channelled through such collaborative framework agreements.
The NWUPC is an affiliate member of Electronics Watch on behalf of its members.
Electronics Watch is an independent monitoring organisation established with the purpose of protecting the rights of workers within supply chains.
Their focus is on working with public sector organisations who purchase electronics and collaborating with them to have a positive impact on workers through the goods the public sector procures.
As members of NWUPC we attend regular Responsible Procurement Group meetings.
We have developed an online training module in order to raise awareness of these risks amongst all relevant staff across the University.
Supplier training is provided in partnership with NETpositive Futures on both Modern Slavery and Ethical Business Practice.
Supplier engagement actions are seeing the University adopt the NETpositive Tool which allows the University to offer free bespoke sustainability action plans to our suppliers.
In line with our commitment to combat modern slavery, we place a strong emphasis on reporting commitments and transparency.
We recognise the importance of openly sharing information regarding our efforts to address this issue within our organisation and supply chains.
Our modern slavery statement serves as a platform to outline our strategies, policies, and actions aimed at eradicating modern slavery.
We are dedicated to providing regular and comprehensive updates on our progress, ensuring that our stakeholders, including students, staff, partners, and the wider community, are well-informed about our ongoing initiatives in the fight against modern slavery.
By promoting transparency in reporting, we demonstrate our unwavering dedication to accountability and the protection of human rights.
We will continue to upload our statement updates to our website, and throughout the next financial year we intend on preparing our statement submission to the Modern Slavery Statement Registry , as well as the TISC Report Registry .
Information for external suppliers about doing business with the University, including a guide to e-tendering, and procurement policy and procedure documents.

New sentences found on https://liverpool.ac.uk/undergraduate/tef-gold-rating:
The University of Liverpool is delighted to hold the Gold TEF award for our outstanding performance in student experience and outcomes.
The University of Liverpool is proud to be awarded Gold, the highest possible award, in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).
This award recognises our excellence in student experience and outcomes.
Achieving the Gold rating recognises the University of Liverpool among an elite group of 46 higher education providers in the UK.
Here are just a few reasons why we’re recognised as the Gold standard (we’ll get to even more later):
TEF is a national scheme run by the Office for Students (OfS).
It encourages universities and colleges to improve and deliver excellence in the areas that students care about the most: teaching, learning and achieving positive outcomes from their studies.
TEF's assessment looks at:
The TEF panel then awards one rating for the student experience and one for student outcomes.
The TEF panel , which is made up of independent academics and students, conducts assessments and makes decisions on a number of criteria based on the information it is provided.
It uses these insights to decide which award each university should be given.
The panel considers evidence submitted by both institutions and their students, as well as numerical indicators that are determined by using national datasets.
These are benchmarked to show how well the university or college performs based on the students it teaches and the courses it offers.
TEF assesses lots of areas of a university’s offering, so it’s not easy to be awarded Gold.
That’s why we’re extremely proud to have achieved this prestigious marker.
To get the Gold award, student experience and outcomes must be deemed to be typically outstanding.
TEF Gold universities, those that achieve the highest rating, are considered to be consistently performing at an exceptionally high standard in the areas that matter most to students.
A TEF Gold rating could be an important factor in a student choosing where they want to study, as it is a trusted mark of quality.
TEF Gold is important because it’s all about giving confidence to the most important people in higher education - students.
The Teaching Excellence Framework showcases which universities nationwide offer excellent teaching and learning for students.
It also encourages those that aren’t achieving top scores to prioritise improvement to the experience they offer students.
If you’re a current or prospective University of Liverpool undergraduate student, the TEF Gold award means you can be certain that when you study at Liverpool, you’ll get access to outstanding teaching, support, and graduate prospects.
When you see the TEF Gold badge, you can trust that we provide an engaging student experience for our students and an extremely high quality of education across our undergraduate courses.
Our students also feel supported throughout their time with us and are set up to succeed as graduates as they move into their careers after Liverpool.
Professor Tim Jones, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, perfectly sums up why Liverpool is the Gold standard.
"Our Gold rating in TEF 2023 underlines our commitment to world-class teaching and learning, with teaching delivered by leading experts and research-connected curricula across our courses.
Employability is embedded throughout our undergraduate programmes, and our graduates enjoy high employability rates”.
The TEF panel considered several different areas when awarding Liverpool the prestigious TEF Gold rating.
Below, you can find some of the key areas where they decided our offer was outstanding.
Our Careers and Employability team advises students on course modules, learning outcomes and assessment.
We also embed employability modules into all courses.
Half of our undergraduate students choose to take at least one of these.
Students also have access to employers at every stage of study.
What’s more, nearly half of our undergraduate courses are accredited by one of 129 professional, statutory and regulatory bodies.
Many of our undergraduates also have the opportunity to undertake a Year in Industry.
This means they gain substantial professional experience, which prepares them for the future and entering exciting careers.
Nearly 85% of our students say that “as a result of studying at the University of Liverpool, I believe that I have improved my future prospects”.
We’ve increased our investment in support for students by over £4.75 million.
This has allowed us to enhance our central team.
They work with faculty-based Learning and Teaching Support Officers to provide invaluable help to our students in a number of vitally important areas:
We successfully widen access to higher education .
Nearly 20% of our student body is made up of students from the most deprived areas in the UK.
As part of our Access and Participation Plan , which supports widening access to higher education and student retention, we offer more than £10 million in scholarships and bursaries every year.
This includes targeted funding for asylum seekers, care leavers, mature students, Black African and Caribbean heritage applicants.
Support doesn’t end there.
For example, groups who face known barriers to education are supported with a programme of bespoke activities before Welcome Week .
This includes commuter students, disabled students and mature students.
These activities are designed to enable all students to get the most out of university from day one.
We are a university community with substantial international reach.
Our alumni span over 180 countries and we have established our place among the 200 leading universities globally.
Our international role is intrinsically linked to Liverpool.
We harness our global reach to contribute to the city region’s international profile, boosting its economy and creating meaningful connections between the region, alumni and partners worldwide.
The University has a partnership Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Universit y (XJTLU) in China.
Our XJTLU 2+2 programme brings around 2,500 Chinese students to Liverpool every year.
It also provides an exciting opportunity for UK undergraduates to spend a year in China.
Our Global Opportunities programme is one of the most expansive in the UK.
We provide options for undergraduate students to study abroad, reaping life-changing benefits.
We aim to make a difference to the world we live in through research and innovation.
Our research collaborations extend worldwide and address many of the challenges facing mankind today.
The University of Liverpool is part of the internationally renowned Russell Group of 24 UK universities, recognised for their world-leading research.
Our undergraduates are encouraged to engage with this ground-breaking work.
They’re expected to immerse themselves in departmental research culture throughout their studies and research informs every aspect of teaching.
Further research opportunities are also provided through vacation studentships .
Although we’ve achieved TEF Gold, we will keep building on this success to ensure students continue to receive an outstanding education and experience.
Vasiliki Samuels, former President of the Liverpool Guild of Students, says, “we’re really pleased that the University of Liverpool has been awarded Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework.
Working on the student submission was a great opportunity to involve student feedback directly in the process.
We look forward to continuing to work closely with the University, expanding on good practice in the institution, as well as continuing to amplify the student voice and improve the educational experience”.
Tim Jones, Vice Chancellor, agrees.
He says, “we’ll be making sure we keep up the hard work to continue to give our students the best possible experience and help them to achieve their individual goals”.

We require all applicants for undergraduate programmes to demonstrate a good general education, which includes acceptable levels of literacy and numeracy, normally equivalent to at least grade 4 or C at GCSE in English and Mathematics.
Individual programmes may have additional requirements, and these are outlined on our online course pages .
International students must have an internationally-recognised English language qualification.

If applicants have taken AS-levels, we would expect them to record the results on the UCAS application, but we will not specifically require students to have taken AS-levels for entry to our programmes.

We recognise the A* grade as an indication of remarkable achievement but do not normally use it in making offers to applicants; however, we may use the A* to draw distinctions between otherwise equally qualified candidates at confirmation.
We may, exceptionally, make an offer requiring an applicant to obtain an A* where it is in the applicant’s best interest to do so; for example if the A* grade compensates for a previously-obtained A-level at a lower grade.

However, we may seek verification of qualifications that are not forwarded to us in this way.
Applicants who are taking qualifications whose results are not transmitted directly to the University should ensure that proof of their results is sent directly to the Admissions Team as soon as they are available.
Please note that the University requires proof of the results for all the qualifications recorded on the UCAS application form, not just those that form part of a conditional offer.
Non-UK applicants will be required to send us photocopies or scans of their certificates, transcripts, etc and to present their original documents at the point of registration.

Applications to the University of Liverpool and contextual data for fair admissions.
Fundamentally, we believe that everyone with ability should be given every opportunity to succeed.
We are therefore exploring ways in which we can use contextual data for fair access in our offer making.
All universities, including ours, receive information from UCAS derived from the details you enter on your UCAS form.
This includes the school or socio-economic context in which you have previously studied, together with information about any disability you may have, and whether you have been in social care at any point in your life.
Taken together, this information is often referred to as ‘contextual data’ as it provides us with some ‘context’ of any barriers that may have affected your learning journey.
This data helps to facilitate fair access in admissions.
This data can help universities to understand more fully the academic potential that you may have, potential that may not have been fully demonstrated by your prior academic achievements.
We recognise that circumstances beyond your control can impact on your learning and we want to account for that in our admissions process.
Considerable research has been undertaken, at both Liverpool and elsewhere, into the validity of such indicators of academic potential.
The University is now satisfied that the use of contextual data for fair access is sufficiently robust in helping identify applicants who may have faced significant barriers to their education.
If you wish to know more about the research being undertaken in this area, visit UCAS's webpages .
Find out more about how we are using contextual data to make offers to specific groups .
The University of Liverpool uses a purpose built system to identify data that can provide context to an applicant’s learning journey.
This system takes into account a combination of the following indicators.
The home postcode, which you provide on your UCAS application, is assessed against geo-demographic profiling dataset: Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).
This dataset categorises postcode areas to identify socio-economic disadvantage according to the following characteristics.
This dataset arranges the information collected into ten categories which they call ‘Deciles.
The University of Liverpool pairs the deciles into groups of 2 which are then known as Quintiles 1-5.
Quintile 1 (comprising of Decile 1 and 2) is the most socio-economically deprived group while Quintile 5, (comprising of deciles 9 and 10) are the least deprived.
Applicants from IMD quintile 1 will automatically receive a reduced offer of up to two grades below the standard offer (except Medicine and Foundation programmes).
Check your home postcode in: English indices of deprivation 2019 Postcode Lookup
If you declare a disability your application will be referred to our specialist Disability Support Team.
They are experts in making individual assessments on an applicant’s circumstances.
If you have spent any time in social care you will qualify for a reduced offer of up to 2 grades below the standard offer (except Medicine and Foundation programmes).
The University welcomes declarations of disability and social care status and the information provided from this data will only be used to develop a positive, supportive and fair approach for all.
After a review of how we use contextual data for fair access, the University of Liverpool is now using UCAS MEM data alongside our internal contextual data system.
UCAS use MEM data as their main measure of equalities.
MEM data considers a number of available data sets including:
More detailed information on MEM data can be found on the UCAS website.
If we identify you as having demonstrated academic potential in the context of difficult personal circumstances, the University will use this information in the following ways:
Medicine applications are processed as outlined in our Departmental Supplement to the Admissions Policy .
The process is in three stages and offers are made following an assessment of academic potential, medicine admission test performance (UCAT) and interview.
Routinely, while all applications are assessed on an individual basis against our published criteria, applicants who meet the criteria for  the university’s policy on contextual data for fair access, may be given additional consideration in relation to any of the stages of the process.
Thus each application is reviewed to determine if it is appropriate to accept reduced GCSE, UCAT or interview performance.
Applicants who meet the criteria for contextual data and fair access would be expected to offer at least 12 points at GCSE (scoring system as outlined in our Departmental Supplement)  However,  English Language and Maths GCSEs would need to meet minimum requirements of grade 6.
Flexibility on UCAT and MMI performance are determined annually when the scores are available from all applicants.
Veterinary science applications are processed as outlined in our Departmental Supplement to the Admissions Policy .
We will make allowances for applicants who meet the criteria for the university's policy on contextual data for fair access when considering applications and these applicants may also receive a reduced offer.
Special consideration may be given to applicants who meet the agreed criteria for contextual data for fair access following interviews when making offers.
We will not be making any reduced offers for applicants who meet the criteria for contextual data for fair access however, special consideration may be given during the selection for interview stage.
To determine if you are eligible for a contextual offer, please answer the questions in our Indicator Tool .
Applicants can experience a wide range of issues that may cause a disruption to learning and may impact detrimentally on results.
We are particularly interested in applicants who are:
However if you have experienced personal, social or domestic issues which do not fit under these categories, please complete the Disrupted Studies Form (Word, 24KB) .
Please note, if you are applying for Medicine, Dentistry or Veterinary Science, your Disrupted Studies Form must be submitted by the October 15th deadline.
For all other courses, we accepted Disrupted Studies Forms until the 1st August of the year you intend to begin studies.
The above does not cover COVID related disruption as this is being addressed more widely.
If you have any further queries please contact Jo McNeill, Fair Access in Admissions Manager

The University of Liverpool is keen to support the admission and success of applicants who experience barriers to their education.
The University has launched a contextual admissions strategy for eligible UK students.
Building on our proud and long-standing success in widening participation, we have adopted the use of contextual offers for applicants in the main UCAS recruitment cycle.
This will provide up to a 2-grade reduction* from the standard offer for the following under-represented groups:

The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a dataset based on home postcodes which identify the relative deprivation of different areas across the four nations of the UK.
This allows data to be compared across the UK and helps to identify which areas have the highest levels of deprivation.
IMD data is split into ten sections known as ‘deciles’ however, at the University of Liverpool we have paired the deciles to make Quintiles.
Decile 1 and 2 have been paired to make Quintile 1 to identify those most deprived while Decile 9 and 10 now form Quintile 5 and identify those least deprived.
It is the IMD quintile 1 group which the University of Liverpool is going to offer additional support to.

For this reason, if applicants declare on their application forms that they have a relevant criminal conviction, the University will undertake a risk assessment process to consider the conviction and whether the applicant poses a risk to members of the University community.
Further details of the actions we will take may be found in our Criminal Convictions Policy 2022 (PDF, 357KB) .
The University prides itself on the high standards it sets in managing its admissions procedures, but we recognise that sometimes things can go wrong or misunderstandings occur.
We encourage applicants to try to work with Admissions and our Academic Departments to resolve any issues informally where they can, but we appreciate this isnt always possible.
We have therefore established an Admissions Appeals and Complaints Policy which applicants may use if they believe they have grounds for an appeal or complaint.
Applicants should be aware that copying material from other sources – including the web – is considered a serious academic offence, and is known as plagiarism.
Applicants for undergraduate degree will have the personal statement that they submit as part of their application form checked by UCAS against a library of personal statements, to identify whether any phrases or sentences are identical with those held in UCAS’s records.
A full explanation of what we mean by plagiarism and how we deal with it during the admissions process may be found in our Plagiarism Policy below.
By accepting the offer of a place on a programme or module, you enter into a legally binding contract with the University of Liverpool ("the University") which can only be varied by agreement in writing.
In so doing, you accept and agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

It's important to find a university that will support a student’s ambition and where they will be happy.
Some subjects are taught at many universities so students will have to do a great deal of research to narrow their choices to find the right place.
Students should always seek advice and discuss their options with advisers, university staff, family and friends but the final decision should be their own.
Here are our ten aspects to consider to help your students find the right university for them:
Firstly you should use the UCAS Course Finder http://search.ucas.com/ to create a shortlist of institutions who offer courses on your subject of interest.
Do you want to stay near to home or go further afield?
Would you be more comfortable in a big city or a rural location?
If you want to be successful you need to be comfortable with your surrounds.
The UCAS course finder can filter results by region.
Apply for universities that you will be proud to put on your CV.
A degree from a good university will set you up for life.
Red Brick and Russell Group universities are often a good option.
A similar sounding degree at one university can be quite different to that at another.
Look for information on module choice, assessments and field trips.
Universities will often have different requirements for similar sounding courses.
Thoroughly check that you meet all the academic requirements.
Degree programmes that are in high demand often have additional tests, interviews and work experience requirements.
Can you have an industry placement, or perhaps study abroad as part of your degree?
Future employers will be impressed if you can talk about additional experiences that you have.
Look out for scholarships and bursaries, because every university will offer something different.
Check whether you need to apply for this funding or if they are automatically awarded.
Your student loan will go much further in some cities than others.
Have a look at the Royal Bank of Scotland’s list of most affordable university cities.

At university you will focus on your studies but you need to get the balance right.
If you have a particular hobby can you continue it at your new home?
Non-curriculum activities will allow you to have fun and you can often use these activities to illustrate your skills to future employers.
It is essential to visit the places you are thinking of living for the next few years.
An Open Day is a great opportunity to see facilities and talk to staff about course content and admissions.

Choosing the right course at the right institution is a big decision for students.
At the University of Liverpool alone we offer over 1000 courses, so we understand that narrowing options down to one can be tricky!
If a student has specific career aspirations, or a narrow subject of interest, course selection will be easier.
However, if a student is interested in a popular subject they will need to do more work to narrow their choices.
Here are some of the tip tips we give to students to help them make the right choice:
Enjoyment: Choose a subject that you will enjoy.
If you enjoy it you will achieve better grades and are more likely to successfully complete your degree.
Career aspirations: Find out if there an essential or recommended degree for you to take.
Professionally accredited courses and industry placements will get you on your way to attaining your dream job.
Admissions requirements: Thoroughly check that you will meet all the requirements (academic, work experience, additional tests etc).
Universities may have very different requirements for similar sounding courses.
Research: Thoroughly investigate modules, assessment and teaching styles, and visit universities to assess them first-hand.
A BA in History at one university may be very different to that at other institution.
Reliable Source: When you look for information or ask for advice make sure the source is reliable and up to date.
Admissions requirements and course contents do change so double check directly with universities.
Assume: Don’t just hope that you will make the right choice.
Do plenty of research so that you know you have chosen the perfect course for you.
Passive: Asking others for advice is important but don’t let them make your decision for you.
Remember, you will be the one studying, writing assignments and sitting exams!
Last Minute: A rushed application will not be a good application.
Allow yourself plenty of time to research courses and write your personal statement.
Timing: Don’t be afraid to take a gap year if you are not certain whether university is right for you.
You can defer your entry year on your UCAS form or apply at a later date.
Make your gap year count though so that you have interesting things to put in your personal statement or CV.
Shy: Don’t be afraid to ask questions.
Contact universities directly to make sure you are making an informed choice.

For the University of Liverpool, while the supportive information section is optional, we would like referees to use this section to refer bespoke to the applicant.
You may wish to support what the applicant has said in their statement, mention if they have completed a WP scheme such as Realising Opportunities or provide context to their academic performance and predicted grades.
For independent applicants and for applicants who are resitting qualifications or who have taken a gap year before applying, we would expect the referee to refer to the applicant’s circumstances in the reference.
If the reference doesn’t include text in the supportive information section, we may contact the referee to ask for a brief statement on the applicant.
The UCAS website has resources to support referees, which you may find helpful to refer to when writing your reference.

Our Financial Support Team are available to answer student’s questions about funding and offer personalised budgeting advice.
Here are our Top Ten Budgeting tips that you can share with your year 13s for when they become first year university students:
List all your expenses (food, accommodation, bills …) and income (loan, grants, salary…) and be realistic about your requirements.
Take note of the due dates too to make sure you avoid any late charges.
Look for an interest-free overdraft.
Some accounts also offer freebies like Rail Cards.
Always read the small print so you know when you need to repay.
Check with universities to see what extra money or discounts you qualify for.
Every university will have different packages and remember to check if you have to apply or if you are automatically allocated it.
Is it available elsewhere at a cheaper price?
Is a second-hand copy okay?
Remember to ask for student discount.
Even if you pay for catered accommodation you will still need to organise lunches.
It is much cheaper to buy supplies from the supermarket to make your own sandwiches and to have a refillable bottle than to buy food and drinks when you are out.
Do you need it?
If you don’t really need it put it back!
Having a list when you shop helps you keep on track.
Also, eat before you shop.
It is easier to resist those snacks by the tills when you are not hungry.
Your focus should be on your studies but many students have a part time job during term and/or a full time one over the summer.
Not only will this help your finances but it will look good on your CV.
When you receive your student loans and grants transfer enough money to cover all your bills into a one account and have a separate account for your ‘play money’.
This will help you make sure that you are never caught short for your bills.
Missing payments for bills can damage your credit history and cause you problems later on.
If you dip into money that is allocated to your bills you will get yourself into a financial mess.
Try to be strict with yourself and don’t take your debit card out with you on a night out!
If you have stuck to your budget and you have a little money to spare get yourself a present!
My top tip would be to write everything down and try to plan and budget when you can.
I always try to shop with a list too which stops me from getting distracted and just chucking everything in!
If you have a bad week it’s not the end of the world as it happens to everyone!
Just be extra strict with yourself the next week.
Budgeting definitely comes with experience and in no time at all most students will feel like they’ve joined the real adult world of responsibility and bills.
The joys!

This module will introduce students to Intellectual Property Law and offer essential knowledge covering various intellectual property rights in a national, regional and international context.
The module will explore a range of important, contemporary issues affecting IP Law, such as intellectual property rights and the public interest; the emergence of patent trolls, and the protection of computer implemented inventions.
Completion of the module will enable students to develop a set of intellectual tools necessary to critically engage with current debates at the intersection of law, regulation, and business.
For students who have previously studied any branch of intellectual property law, the module will enhance their existing knowledge, skills and understanding but the module does not presuppose any prior knowledge and is equally suited to students who are new to the subject.
This module will introduce students to the fundamental rules of contract law, with a particular focus on commercial contracts.
It explores the fundamental requirements of any contract such as offer, acceptance and consideration and also considers the different types of contractual term and the way in which contracts are interpreted.
The module analyses commercial contracts, including that of a sale of goods, alongside discussion of international issues around choice of law, jurisdiction, and the application of international conventions.
This module will introduce contemporary theoretical discourses around innovation and artificial intelligence within a competitive global legal sector.
It will explore the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the context of legal services and legal decision-making and also analyse legal, regulatory and ethical constraints on the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the legal sector.
This module will introduce students to the emerging legal and regulatory frameworks that govern cryptocurrencies.
This is a fast-paced and novel area at the intersection of law, regulation and technology and the module will explore the challenges, from a business law perspective, of cryptocurrency.
This includes the difficulties posed by a nascent regulatory framework, uncertainties around jurisdiction, and various specific risks stemming from the links between cryptocurrency and criminality.
This module consists of preparing a dissertation which is researched and written during the Summer.
The dissertation is on an approved topic, in the field of the relevant specialism in case of students opting for a specialised LLM (as opposed to the general LLM).
The module is worth 60 credits (a third of the entire LLM programme) and is a prerequisite for the award of an LLM.
The process of preparing the dissertation is supported by legal research and library training in semester 1, by a dissertation workshop in semester 2, and by individual supervision during the Summer.
Our LLM programme is designed to enhance your academic profile and to ensure that you leave us with highly marketable skills, whatever you decide that market to be.
An LL.M in International Business Law provides rigorous training in legal analysis and promotes critical thinking, independent research and project management skills.
As such, it is excellent preparation for those students seeking to pursue a career in legal practice, and who wish to develop their knowledge base and skills in matters of contemporary importance in international business law.
Graduates will be in a position to pursue careers in areas of trade, investment, financial, or regulatory legal interest, including international organisations, government, or industry.
For those interested in the political and social dimensions of global economic regulation and responsible business, the knowledge base and critical skills developed will support the pursuit of careers in third-sector organizations such as NGOs or charities.
The LL.M also serves as an entry into further academic training at the postgraduate level, including doctoral studies.
Full-time place, per year: £22,000
Tuition fees cover the cost of your teaching and assessment, operating facilities such as libraries, IT equipment, and access to academic and personal support.
Candidates for admission to the LL.M Programme will have an upper second class (or equivalent) first degree in Law (i.e.
average marks of 60% or above, or the equivalent in foreign qualifications).
Candidates who have a lower second class honours degree will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Candidates whose first degree is in a discipline other than Law may be admitted at the discretion of the Programme Director, e.g.
if they have relevant work experience (relevant work experience might include work in the legal or corporate sectors) or a degree in a relevant discipline (such as business, economics, political science, history, criminology, sociology, international relations etc).
In addition, candidates whose first language is not English are required to pass an approved English language test to the required standard (e.g.
IELTS band 6.5, with no component less than 6.0)*.
This requirement is generally waived if the candidate’s first degree and/or secondary education was obtained at an institution using English as the language of instruction.
* If the academic requirements have been met, but not the language requirements, students can complete a pre-sessional English Language course at the University of Liverpool or RUW.

Unfortunately, we are not able to provide further feedback where an application has been unsuccessful.
If we make you an offer, it will be either conditional or unconditional.
A conditional offer means that there are still requirements that you need to meet before you can progress further in the application process.
Offer conditions can relate to academic requirements, English language requirements or further information such as references or a request for portfolio, where appropriate.

You must ensure that you leave enough time after meeting the conditions to make arrangements to start your course, for example if you need to arrange accommodation or a visa.
An Unconditional offer has no conditions which means that there are no further requirements that you need to meet.
For any offer received you should reply to confirm your acceptance or if you wish to decline the offer.
Please use the postgraduate application tracker to do this.
Please note that you can accept only one unconditional offer.
If you have been made unconditional offers for more than one programme, you will need to choose one to accept.

At the University of Liverpool, we offer postgraduate research degrees and projects (studentships) and research master's degrees across a range of fields.
Postgraduate research, also referred to as 'doctoral' research, is the highest level of qualification awarded by UK universities.
Unlike undergraduate and master’s courses, which are comprised of taught modules and assessed coursework, postgraduate research centres on the completion of an independent research project.
When you undertake postgraduate research, you’ll benefit from the direction and expertise of one or more supervisors.
However, it’s ultimately your responsibility to successfully plan, lead and manage your research project.
You’ll also be expected to take advantage of broader opportunities such as publishing, communicating your research, and networking with fellow researchers, academics and industry partners.
Your research will inform the main output of your degree, which is a thesis.
A thesis is a concentrated piece of original work that you're required to write and submit to successfully complete your degree.
You can submit a thesis of no more than 100,000 words, or a collection of original, creative material alongside a written thesis of no more than 50,000 words that contextualises the material.
To be awarded a doctoral qualification, you must defend your thesis in a viva voce (oral examination).
This gives you the opportunity to demonstrate that your research has made an original contribution to knowledge in your field of study.
Our postgraduate research opportunities are equivalent in challenge and qualification, but there’s key differences between each route.
If you can self-fund or source your own funding, you'll typically negotiate a research project of your choice with a potential supervisor.
Your project should be suited to the areas of expertise outlined for our research degrees.
Research projects – commonly referred to as studentships – are usually specific projects that universities are looking for students to work on.
Many research projects come with funding attached.
If you want to apply for a research project or a Doctoral Training Programme, your research topic and supervision will typically be predetermined.
However, you may be able to propose your own project in some instances.
A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at the University of Liverpool typically lasts 2-4 years (full-time) or 4-6 years (part-time).
As a PhD student, you’re required to carry out independent research that presents an original contribution to knowledge within your chosen discipline.
You’ll receive the support and direction of one or more supervisors with expertise in your field of study.
A Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree is equivalent to a PhD in qualification and scope but is designed specifically for medical graduates.
You’ll focus on research that informs your professional practice, so you can develop advanced skills, methods and approaches within the medical field.
To successfully apply for an MD, you typically need to hold a qualification registrable with the General Medical Council (GMC).
Though equivalent to a PhD in qualification and scope, Professional Doctorates are designed for those who want to complete their studies while continuing with their career.
You'll undertake research relating to your current organisation whilst developing the highest level of professional skills and knowledge related to your profession.
At the University of Liverpool, we offer the following Professional Doctorates: Doctor of Clinical Psychology DClinPsychol , Endodontics DDSc , Orthodontics DDSc , Paediatric Dentistry DDSc and Professional Doctorate in Health DProfHealth .
Duration and available study modes differ.
Our research master’s degrees are ideal for students interested in proceeding to doctoral study but want to experience what it’s like before committing to a PhD or an equivalent postgraduate research degree.
Our Master of Research (MRes) degrees typically last 1 year (full-time) or 2 years (part-time).
It places more emphasis on research skills than a traditional postgraduate taught (master’s) degree.
MRes degrees typically include taught modules that introduce specific subjects and relevant professional and research skills.
MRes students are also required to complete a piece of research that centres around their proposed research topic.
A Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree at the University of Liverpool typically last 2 years (full-time) or 4 years (part-time).
MPhils can be thought of as a shorter version of a PhD.
As an MPhil student, you must develop and submit a thesis of no more than 60,000 words, or a collection of original, creative material, alongside a written thesis of no more than 25,000 words which contextualises the material.
As with a postgraduate research degree, you'll be expected to defend your thesis in a viva voce examination.
If you wish to continue onto doctoral level study, you may be able to transfer to registration for a postgraduate research degree.
The transfer must take place after the first year of registration for full-time MPhil students or the second year of registration for a part-time MPhil students, and before giving notice of intention to submit a thesis.

These procedures form part of the university’s policy on student conduct and discipline and should be operated alongside this policy and its other procedures, in order to achieve consistency in operating the procedures across all university residences and alignment with all other procedures associated with student discipline.
The procedures are designed to:
‘University residence’ refers to any owned or managed accommodation provided by the university, this includes: traditional halls of residence, self-catered residences and other residential accommodation provided by a third party which the university manages on their behalf.
For the purposes of these procedures, ‘university residence’ also includes private facilities which the university has contracted to deliver accommodation to students under the terms of the university’s tenancy agreement.
Separate agreements will be put in place to deal with misconduct by a resident who is not a student of the university, normally in residence under the auspices of a commercial agreement between the university and a partner.
These procedures do not cover members of staff who are residents (except where a member of staff is also a student of the university).
Delegated powers and responsibilities by the senate for disciplinary action within university residences are assigned to:
This level of jurisdiction within these procedures is limited to the ‘sphere of responsibility’ of those listed above, and allows for a more effective means of dealing with offences related to university residences, such as less serious breaches in the tenancy agreement and less serious offences.
Different levels of jurisdiction are required so that cases can be handled according to their severity and, where appropriately, with an appropriate speed, to ensure that minor breaches, such as excessive noise, unacceptable behaviour or discourtesy to staff, can be checked to avoid any escalation of misconduct.
Students who are residents in university residential accommodation are bound by the terms of the tenancy agreement which sets out the limits of acceptable behaviour in the residences, which have the force of regulations under the policy on student conduct and discipline.
Complaints about student misconduct in university residences may be brought to hall wardens and hall managers by residential advisers, residences staff, other university staff, other residents, the emergency services or members of the public who are affected by students’ misbehaviour.
From time to time, the behaviour of individual students in the residential setting may raise concerns about their general health and well-being, which may extend beyond concerns about their conduct to be dealt with using disciplinary procedures.
Residential staff are encouraged to seek advice from appropriate parties where they have such concerns.
Under these procedures, wardens and hall managers should be aware that instances of serious misconduct by students who are studying on professional programmes, (eg medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, health sciences) may have significant implications for their fitness to continue to train in these clinical disciplines, and appropriate advice should be sought.
Under the university’s policy on student conduct and discipline and under these procedures, the director and deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services have authority to apply all permissible penalties within the jurisdiction of the hall warden or manager and up to but not exceeding the following penalties against students whose behaviour is deemed to warrant such measures:
Hall Wardens and Hall Managers have the power of jurisdiction within their own residences.
However, if they feel compelled to make a complaint about a student’s behaviour themselves, they should submit this complaint to the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services.
The director may appoint a warden or a manager from another university residence to judge the case, unless the alleged offence falls outside the normal sphere of responsibility of a warden or manager.
In that case, the matter should be referred, via the director of residential, sport and commercial services, to the chief operating officer, under the university’s formal disciplinary procedures.
Hall wardens and managers have jurisdiction over students who are resident in their own residences, providing the offence does not merit penalties outside their powers of jurisdiction.
This jurisdiction includes residents’ conduct inside and in the vicinity of the relevant residence and residents’ conduct where it is associated with their residence.
Where a visitor of a student misbehaves whilst in the university residence, the student themselves will be held responsible and would be the subject of any disciplinary action.
The limits to the penalties which can be applied by hall wardens and managers are:
(A fine is defined as a sum of money imposed as a penalty following disciplinary action.
A charge is defined as a sum of money imposed on the student in recompense for damage caused or loss incurred.
Both fines and charges are payable in accordance with the policy on payment of fees, fines and charges.
A fine can be levied in addition to a charge following disciplinary action.)
Hall wardens and managers may forbid a student who is not a resident in their residence to enter the residence either temporarily or permanently and they may forbid a student who has been expelled from the residence to enter the residence as a visitor either temporarily or permanently.
Should a student disobey the hall wardens or managers in these circumstances, disciplinary action may be taken as below.
As part of the tenancy agreement and by virtue of being a member of the university community, students are expected to exercise courtesy to other residences at all times.
This includes keeping noise to a minimum, especially at night, to respect other people’s property and to maintain an appropriate level of cleanliness in communal areas such as kitchens.
Students are also expected to maintain courteous and polite relationships with members of staff and are expected to follow instructions of staff when asked to do so.
In order to deal swiftly with general poor levels of housekeeping and low-level antisocial behaviour such as noise, hall wardens/managers may impose sanctions not exceeding the following:
This provision is permitted in order that general standards of behaviour are maintained and the process is sufficiently light-touch to deal effectively with low-level anti-social behaviour.
In all cases, however, wardens/managers are required to establish the facts and to investigate any counter-claim made by the perpetrators, and, if necessary, use the stage one procedures (below) where it emerges that this informal approach will not resolve the issue.
There is no right of appeal against actions taken under these circumstances, although a student could, if they wished the matter to be considered further, request that the matter is reviewed using the stage one procedures below.
Hall warden/managers are required to inform any student who is subject to any procedure for handling misconduct of their right to advice and representation by the Guild of Students.
Stage one of the procedures is designed to allow more serious incidents or repeated bad behaviour to be dealt with quickly by the hall warden or manager to prevent further breaches and sustain appropriate standards of conduct and behaviour of all students in university residences.
Any complaint about more serious student misconduct or repeated offences should be submitted to the hall warden or manager in writing, together with any relevant documentation or other evidence.
The hall warden or manager will invite the student for an interview, setting out clearly, in writing, the nature of the infringement, alongside any evidence which has been collected.
Under normal circumstances, at least 24 hours’ notice should be provided to the student unless there is a substantial body of evidence in which case it is advised that at least 48 hours’ notice is provided.
Where a student wishes to obtain advice and/or representation from the guild of students, the timing of such a meeting should take account of this.
The student should be informed of the time and location of the meeting and the people who will be present at the meeting.
This would normally be the hall warden or manager, and at least one other person who would also act as note-taker,.
The student should be permitted to bring a friend as a supporter.
Normally, this would be fellow student or a member of the guild of students.
Where a student wishes to be accompanied to the meeting by other people who are acting as witnesses, the hall warden or manager may ask other staff members to be present.
The notes of the meeting should provide a summary of the issues which were discussed and record of the decision(s) taken by the Hall Warden or Manager.
At the meeting the hall warden or manager will hear from the complainant, where present, and the student.
The student should be given the opportunity to either admit or deny the allegation(s) made against them.
Under all circumstances, the warden/hall manager will take into consideration all the information and evidence presented and any mitigation offered by the student, and will only then decide whether or not the case against the student is proven.
If the case against the student is proven or the student has admitted to the allegation of misconduct, the hall warden or manager may impose a penalty which may include one or more of the following:
The imposition of a penalty is at the discretion of the hall warden or manager and, whilst the limits of those penalties are set out in this policy, there is no ‘tariff’ system in operation.
Penalties imposed must be proportionate and be applied consistently and hall wardens and managers must take into account the implications for the student of imposing a specific penalty.
The hall warden or manager will also issue a warning to indicate to the student that further breaches or infringements are likely to lead to more serious disciplinary action.
This warning will be included in the outcome letter (see below).
Wardens may not impose any other penalty than those listed above when using stage one of these procedures as this would constitute a procedural irregularity and thus provide grounds for appeal.
Hall wardens or managers may impose a suspended fine where they believe it is the best course of action under the circumstances.
If the case against the student is not proven, this decision should be provided to the student in writing, and no record of misconduct would be kept on the student’s file.
Where the original complaint was made by another student, the hall warden or manager should consider how best to inform the complainant to avoid any undesirable consequences.
A copy of the notes of a stage one disciplinary hearing and the outcome letter to the student should be retained by the hall warden or manager.
The outcome of the hearing and the details of the penalty should be set out, in writing, to the student.
A warning should also be included in this outcome letter to indicate to the student that further breaches or infringements are likely to lead to more serious disciplinary action.
In the letter, the student should be provided with their right of appeal and details about the grounds and procedures for appeal.
The student should also be informed that if they choose not to appeal, they may request a completion of procedures letter, but such a letter will not be issued automatically.
The outcome letter and all related documentation should be retained by the hall warden or manager against the student file in a secure location.
Such records should be destroyed six years after the student has left the university.
The hall warden or manager will inform the accommodation office if any fine or charge should be raised and this process will be undertaken in accordance with the University’s policy on payment for fees, fines and charges .
A student may appeal against the hall warden or manager’s decision within five calendar days of receiving the outcome letter.
An appeal must be submitted in writing to the accommodation office manager and should be submitted only on one or more of the following grounds accompanied by any evidence:
The accommodation office manager will review the appeal statement and any evidence submitted and will determine whether or not the student has provided evidence that they have grounds for appeal.
If the accommodation office manager determines that the student has not provided evidence that they have grounds for appeal, he/she will write to the student within fifteen working days informing them of the decision and the reasons, and will issue a completion of procedures letter.
There is no further right of appeal to the student.
Advice on this can be obtained from the academic compliance team in SAS.
If the accommodation office manager determines that the student does present information which suggests they have grounds for appeal, they will ask a hall warden or a manager from another residence, who has no previous knowledge of the case, to convene a stage one disciplinary appeal hearing.
The accommodation office manager will write to the student to inform them of the decision and to indicate that they will be contacted by the relevant hall warden or manager.
The new presiding hall warden/manager will appoint normally two residential advisers to form an appeal panel.
No member of the appeal panel should have had any prior dealings with the case in question.
The residential advisers can be from any university residence.
The presiding hall warden/manager will appoint a note-taker.
Where the appeal is heard on grounds 4(i) and 4(ii), the appeal hearing will be heard in accordance with the procedures for a stage one disciplinary hearing ‘de novo’.
The outcome of the hearing will be made in accordance with sections 3(e) and 3(f) above.
Where the appeal is heard on grounds 4 (iii), the appeal panel will sit in private to decide whether or not the penalty originally was disproportionate.
The possible outcomes of the appeal are as follows:
Increases to penalties can only be made if this can be justified as fair and reasonable and they do not exceed the hall warden/manager’s jurisdiction under stage one.
The appeal outcome will be provided in writing to the student with a copy of the notes of the meeting.
The student has no further right of appeal and will be issued with a completion of procedures letter as part of the formal outcome letter, which should be copied to the hall warden/manager of the student’s residence and the accommodation office manager.
The presiding hall warden/ manager will contact the accommodation office to inform them of any change to any fine or charge.
Where a hall warden or manager receives a complaint of serious misconduct the warden/hall manager should initiate stage two of these procedures.
Serious misconduct to be handled under stage two includes behaviour which shows evidence of malice or reckless disregard for others or dishonesty, within the context of university residential life and which could reasonably be expected to be handled under the jurisdiction of the hall warden or manager.
Serious misconduct to be handled under stage two also includes offences alleged to have been committed by students who have already received two warnings under stage one of the procedures.
Where a student’s behaviour is of such a nature that it appears that it constitutes a serious breach in the university’s rules regulating the conduct of students, the hall warden or manager should seek advice from the director of residential, sport and commercial services in the first instance, who will decide whether the breach should be considered, under the jurisdiction of the hall warden/manager or under the formal disciplinary procedures under the university’s policy on student conduct and discipline.
If such serious behaviour places other residents and staff at risk, the warden/hall manager may recommend to the director of residential, sport and commercial services to consider that the student is suspended (removed temporarily) from the residence.
Where the case suggests that other people are at risk if the student remains in the residence, the director of residential, sport and commercial services will convene a risk assessment panel to assess the risks and decide whether or not the student should be removed temporarily from the residence.
The risk assessment panel may comprise the director of legal, risk and compliance, director of student administration and support, academic compliance manager, relevant head of school, relevant school manager, and any other person whose input is required.
The risk assessment panel should also consider whether the student poses a risk to the wider university community, and if so, a suspension from studies, initiated under appendix f of the policy for student conduct and discipline should be considered.
Where the decision is taken to remove the student temporarily from the residence, the implications for the student’s on-going studies and their welfare should be considered and steps taken to avoid any undue disadvantage or prejudging of the disciplinary case.
If the director of residential, sport and commercial services decides that the breach is of sufficient seriousness to warrant consideration under the university’s formal disciplinary procedures, he/she should write a formal complaint to the chief operating officer, or nominee, providing the available evidence and requesting that the matter is investigated formally under appendix a of the policy on student conduct and discipline.
Where the hall warden/manager themselves wishes to complain about serious misconduct of a student in their residence, the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services shall ask a hall warden/manager of another residence to act as the hall warden/manager under stage two of these procedures.
This may be the case where a student has already received repeated warnings and the hall warden/manager may already have handled previous misconduct allegations under stage two.
Where the director of residential, sport and commercial services decides that the breach should be handled by the hall warden/manager under stage two, the hall warden/ manager will convene a residential disciplinary panel.
The residential disciplinary panel should include at least two other independent parties to include at least one student (drawn from the warden/hall manager’s hsc pool) and one member of residential staff.
The hall warden/manager will act as chair of the disciplinary panel.
The complainant cannot be a member of the disciplinary panel.
The hall warden/manager should invite the student to the hearing, setting out clearly, in writing, the nature of the infringement(s), alongside any evidence which has been collected.
At least 48 hours’ notice should be provided to the student.
The student should be informed of the time and location of the meeting and of those who will be present.
The student should be permitted to bring one person who would act as a friend or supporter and who would normally be a fellow student or a representative of the guild of students.
The student will also be invited to call witnesses if they intend to deny the allegations.
The complainant also may wish to bring witnesses.
Both parties should inform the hall warden/manager, in advance of the meeting of the names of the witnesses that are being called.
Witnesses will only be called into the hearing at the appropriate time in the procedures.
Also present would be the complainant (or their representative) and an independent note-taker.
The procedure for the hearing is as follows:
If the student admits to the allegation, the hall warden/manager will invite the student to explain the circumstances surrounding the incident(s) and provide information of any mitigating factors.
The panel members may ask questions of the student.
Once this is done, the student, their supporter and the complainant will be asked to withdraw from the room while the disciplinary panel decides what action, if any, to take.
Section xiii of these procedures should then be followed.
If the student denies the allegation(s), the hall warden/manager will ask the complainant first to set out their complaint, calling witnesses if they so wish.
The disciplinary panel members may ask questions of both the complainant and the witnesses.
The hall warden/manager will then ask the student to respond to the allegations, and to state their case, calling witnesses if they so wish.
The disciplinary panel members may ask questions of both the student and the witnesses.
Where the disciplinary panel requires further clarification on any point which is in dispute, they may ask questions of both the complainant and the student, but the student should be given the opportunity of making the last statement.
After both the complainant and the student have stated their case, the hall warden/manager will ask both parties (and any supporters) to leave the room whilst the disciplinary panel considers whether or not the case against the student is proven.
The disciplinary panel will then deliberate over the merits of the case and will decide whether or not, and on the balance of probabilities, the case against the student is proven.
The student and the complainant will then be invited back into the room for the hall warden/manager to inform the parties of the decision.
Where the case against the student is not proven, the case will be dismissed and this decision will be conveyed in writing to both the student and the complainant within 5 working days of the disciplinary hearing.
No disciplinary record will be held on the student’s record under these circumstances, although a record of the disciplinary hearing should be kept by the warden/hall manager for a period of at least six years.
Where the panel has decided that the allegation(s) against the student are proven, the student will be asked if he/she wishes for any undisclosed offences to be taken into consideration.
This means that any other undisclosed offences can be considered in the determination of any penalty at this stage, rather than at any time in the future.
The student and complainant will be asked to leave the room again while the disciplinary panel decides what penalty, if any, to impose.
The disciplinary panel may not impose any penalty which exceeds the following:
The warden/hall manager will write to the student confirming the outcome of the disciplinary hearing which will include details of any penalty that has been imposed and the student’s right of appeal and the grounds on which the student may appeal.
The letter will also contain a final warning to the student that if there is any further misconduct, the student may face more serious sanctions or penalties which could include expulsion from the residence and/or further referral under the disciplinary procedures.
A record of the disciplinary outcome will be retained on the student file by the hall warden/manager for a period of 10 years, and a copy of the outcome letter and final warning will be sent to the director of student administration and support to be retained on the student’s central student record.
Any stage two disciplinary record held against a student’s record may be disclosed to the university’s board of discipline should the student be referred under the university’s disciplinary procedures at a future date.
Where a student has appeared before a formal residential disciplinary panel on more than one occasion and the allegations were proven, a copy of the outcome letter will be sent to the student’s head of department.
The hall warden/manager will inform the accommodation office if any fine or charge should be raised and this process will be undertaken in accordance with the University’s policy on payment for fees, fines and charges .
Exceptionally, where the disciplinary panel believes that the proven misconduct warrants a penalty which exceeds the limits of the jurisdiction as set out above, such as expulsion from the residences, the hall warden/manager will defer the decision about what penalty to impose and will make a recommendation to the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services.
The hall warden/hall manager will notify the student and the complainant verbally at the end of the disciplinary hearing that the decision has been thus deferred.
The hall warden/manager will then make a recommendation to the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services, providing all relevant documents including the original letter of complaint, the notes of the formal disciplinary hearing, all documentary evidence considered and the student’s full disciplinary record at the residence.
On receipt of this recommendation, the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services will decide, taking advice as necessary, whether or not to approve the recommendation or refer the matter back to the disciplinary panel to impose an alternative penalty within the sphere of the hall warden/manager’s jurisdiction.
There will be no further disciplinary hearing but the student and the complainant will be informed in writing of the outcome, either by the deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services if expulsion is approved, or by the hall warden/manager if an alternative penalty is to be imposed.
The deputy director of residential, sport and commercial services will then proceed with the expulsion of the student from the residence under the terms of the tenancy agreement by issuing a section 8 notice to quit (section 8 possession notice).
This will set out the grounds for seeking a possession order from the courts and expulsion from the residence.
A student may appeal against a decision made by a formal disciplinary panel within 10 working days of receiving the formal outcome letter.
The student must submit an appeal, in writing, to the operational manager, residential services.
An appeal can only be made on one of more of the following grounds:
On receiving the appeal, the operational manager, residential services, will determine whether or not the student has provided evidence that they have grounds for appeal.
If they determine that they have not, they will dismiss the appeal and inform the student, in writing, setting out the reasons.
The letter will also contain a completion of procedures letter.
Where the operational manager, residential services, determines that the information provided does constitute grounds for appeal, they will write to confirm this to the student and refer the matter to the director of residential, sport and commercial services, who will convene a residential disciplinary appeal panel.
The membership of the residential disciplinary appeal panel will be constituted as follows:
Where the appeal is to be heard on the grounds of procedural irregularity or on the basis that new information is now available (ie grounds 1 and 2), the appeal hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures for stage two.
Where the appeal is to be heard on the grounds that the penalty is disproportionate, the following procedures will be followed:
The student is entitled to submit an appeal against the decision of the residential disciplinary appeal panel but only on the grounds that they did not receive a fair hearing as a result of some procedural irregularity.
If a student does not exercise their right to appeal, the secretary will issue a completion of procedures letter after the period of time for appeal has elapsed.
An appeal may be submitted within 10 working days of receipt of the formal outcome letter and should be sent to the secretary to the university’s board of discipline, who, in consultation with the chair of the university’s board of discipline, will decide whether or not the student has presented evidence of grounds for appeal.
If it is determined that the student does have grounds for appeal, the matter will be referred back to the director of residential, sport and commercial services to re-convene the residential disciplinary appeal panel with a different membership to re-hear the case.
If it is determined that the student has not presented evidence that they have grounds for appeal, the secretary to the board of discipline will inform the student in writing and issue a completion of procedures letter.
The Student Charter sets out the general entitlements and responsibilities of students.
If you believe you have a legitimate complaint, you should refer in the first instance to the Student Charter to clarify what is reasonable for you to expect from the University in the relevant area and whether you have discharged your corresponding liabilities, if applicable.
If you do not know who is responsible for a particular area or how to contact him or her, your Department or School Office or the Guild of Students will help you.
Information about the Student Charter is available from the Teaching Quality Support Division .
If, having consulted the Student Charter, you wish to proceed with a complaint you may invoke the Student Complaints Policy and Procedure .
The Student Complaints Policy and Procedure sets out how students may seek to have their complaint addressed.
It should be recognised that the vast majority of concerns which a student may have can be handled fairly, amicably and to the satisfaction of all concerned on an informal basis.
Only when informal means have been exhausted should a complaint be pursued.
Informal advice about the Student Complaints Policy and Procedure may be obtained from the Academic Compliance Team in Student Administration and Support, ( email appeals@liverpool.ac.uk ), or from the Guild of Students.
The Student Complaints Policy and Procedure does not cover the following matters for which separate procedures exist:
A Student Complaints Proforma (Word, 50.7KB) is available.
The University of Liverpool is committed to ensuring that the use of alcohol and drugs does not have an adverse effect on the working and social conditions of University students, staff and visitors.
The University recognises that alcohol and drugs will play a part in the lives of some people and this document is designed to inform you of the University's Policy in relation to these issues.
Any student who is concerned about their use of alcohol or drugs is encouraged to seek advice.
The University will regard anyone seeking support as having a health problem and will provide assistance to enable appropriate help or treatment to be accessed.
Confidential advice and support, or information on other services, for those wishing to discuss problems related to the use of drugs or alcohol is available from the Student Health Service, the University Counselling Service and Liverpool Guild of Students (LGoS).
The University will provide support and information about the health and social issues arising out of drug and alcohol use and misuse.
Alcohol awareness and student health/ wellbeing campaigns will be organised through the University’s Student Health Service and the Liverpool Guild of Students.
The focus will be on minimising harm and on emphasising support networks and accessing reliable sources of information.
Staff in the Student Health Centre, Student Support Services and the Counselling Service can offer advice, information and support.
There are also a number of agencies in the local area providing a range of services.
Student Alcohol and Drugs Policy .
All members of the University community contribute to creating an environment in which everyone can live, study and socialise free from inappropriate disturbance.
Anti-social behaviour resulting from alcohol or drug use is unacceptable and may be grounds for disciplinary action including the possibility of exclusion from the University.
For students on clinical programmes, drug use or excessive alcohol use may also result in a student being referred for consideration under the University’s Fitness to Practise procedures.
Being under the influence of alcohol or otherwise intoxicated will not be considered an excuse for offensive, abusive or illegal behaviour, and may be regarded as an aggravating feature.
It is a breach of the University’s Rules Regulating the Conduct of Students to supply, use or knowingly possess any controlled drug, on University premises including University-owned or managed Halls of Residence.
If you believe that someone has a difficulty in controlling their use of alcohol or drugs you should encourage them to seek support.
Excessive drinking can be the first outward sign that a student is under stress and needs help.
If you are concerned that a student may be a danger to themselves or others it is recommended that you inform a senior member of staff or discuss your concerns with someone from the Student Administration and Support Division or any of the Student Support Services.
Students or staff may become aware of, or suspect, drug use or supply on campus.
In such situations you can report your concerns to the Security Control Office which is open on the campus 24 hours a day and who will take full details.
If concerns are about activity in any of the University Residences then you should report these to the Hall Warden or Manager in the first instance.
It should be noted that action against students by the Police or the University is unlikely to be taken on the basis of anonymous reports or unsubstantiated allegations.
The University will take advice from Merseyside Police when considering appropriate action and the University reserves the right to invite the police to make spot checks on University premises where there is suspicion of persistent drug usage or supply/dealing.
The University has a legal responsibility to provide a safe and healthy environment for students, staff and visitors and will take appropriate steps to ensure this environment is established and maintained.
Under this Act it is an offence for ‘the occupier or someone concerned in the management of any premises knowingly to permit or suffer on those premises the smoking of cannabis; or the production, attempted production, supply, attempted supply, or offering to supply of any controlled drug’ (Misuse of Drugs Act 1971).
It is not the duty of staff to collect evidence, but any suspicion of dealing in controlled drugs on University premises should be reported to the University’s Security Service.
The Head of Security will take whatever action he considers appropriate, which may include involving the police.
The University reserves the right to invite the police to make spot checks on University premises where there is suspicion of persistent drug usage or dealing.
The University will take appropriate action if such incidents occur and will refer these to the Police.
The supply and consumption of alcohol are subject to the restrictions of the Act.
Licence holders have a legal duty to manage premises responsibly and have the authority to ban people for their anti-social behaviour from bars and other social places where alcohol is on sale.
Any events organised are also required to be managed responsibly.
The consequences which can result from a Police caution or a prosecution for the possession, supply or trafficking of illegal drugs are not limited to fines and prison sentences.
A criminal record can have a serious impact on employment prospects, particularly for professions such as law, teaching or medicine.
Even your travel plans can be affected as you may be denied a visa to enter certain countries, such as the United States of America, if you have been cautioned or convicted for a drugs related offence.
A criminal record arising from drunken behaviour can also have a serious impact on employment.
Receiving a police caution for drunk or disorderly conduct should not be treated lightly as this could have an adverse effect on your future career.
The University has a duty of care to all its staff and students and thus it needs to be informed of any alleged criminal activity by its students.
If at any time during your registration on a programme of study at the University you are arrested by the police and charged with a criminal offence, you are required to report this immediately to the Director of Student.
The Policy will be implemented through:
Approved April 2018.
To ensure property left within university owned accommodation at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the accommodation agreement is dealt with consistently and in accordance with service standards and procedures.
This policy is applicable to all members of staff and residents within university owned accommodation.
The policy should be used when property is found or has been left behind at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the accommodation agreement.
The property may belong to residents or their guests.
Left property: personal item of value left behind by residents or guests in a bedroom or communal area after a contract has ended.
Personal items can include:
(The above list is indicative).
University staff and contract staff working on behalf of the university are instructed to consult with the hall management team before removing any left property.
Residents are responsible for clearing all personal belongings from the accommodation before returning keys to the reception at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the accommodation agreement.
Before the end of the period of residence a reminder will be sent to all residents stating that it is the resident’s responsibility to clear all personal belongings from the accommodation before returning keys to the reception.
This policy equally applies if a student fails to return the keys to the accommodation at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the licence agreement and leaves property in the accommodation.
Staff who find a personal item of value when cleaning accommodation at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the licence agreement have a responsibility to notify the halls management team so the item/s can be logged and stored safely and securely.
The hall manager will contact the resident via email and/or letter as well as trying to make contact by telephone advising the student that a personal item of value has been found and should be collected within 28 days from the date of correspondence.
During this period the property will be kept in a safe and secure storage area.
Property left behind after the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the accommodation agreement, which does not fit the category of personal items of value i.e.
Clothing, shoes, cd’s, dvd’s, books etc.
Will be donated to local charities or where possible recycled.
Open foodstuffs, alcohol, toiletries, consumables, bedding and pharmaceuticals will be disposed of.
The university reserves the right to charge the student costs associated with the storage or disposal of any items left in university owned accommodation at the end of the period of residence or upon early termination of the accommodation agreement.

“Researchers are now making greater use of datasets which have been generated through internet-mediated technology and social media.
Researchers need to consider the ethical issues which arise; for example, the interpretation of anonymity and whether participants (e.g.
social media users) would consider data in the public domain to be private, the meaning of informed consent in this context and the important issue of what permissions a researcher has over the data supplied by the data producer (e.g.

The Clinical Studies Group comprises a close collaboration of University staff with clinicians based in the St Paul’s Eye Unit in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.
Together, we have a long history of performing original and novel clinical studies, both leading and contributing to national and international multicentre randomised controlled trials, observational studies and technology development.
Between 30 and 40 clinical studies are running at any one time in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascular diseases, ocular oncology, ocular surface disease and glaucoma.
Highlights include
•  the Liverpool Diabetic Eye Study which led to the introduction of screening for diabetic eye disease in UK and worldwide •  the VPDT and IVAN studies which led to the introduction of current therapy for AMDy
The Group is engaged with all major pharmaceutical companies developing treatments for ocular disease.
We have an active diagnostics research programme in which new methods of electrophysiology, functional vision measures, and methods of structural measurement are being applied to better detect important causes of visual disability.
Our international programme is based around key partnerships.
Research conducted in Malawi with colleagues in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the College of Medicine, University of Malawi, has led to major advances in understanding malarial retinopathy.
The growing burden of diabetic eye disease in sub-Saharan Africa is also being investigated.
We are researching and developing new tampenade agents with colleagues in the University of Hong Kong.
Bacterial infections of the cornea are a major cause of visual loss world-wide.
There are approximately 6000 cases of bacterial keratitis per year in the UK with 200 per year for a city the size of Liverpool or Manchester.
P.
aeruginosa accounts for approximately 25% of cases of severe bacterial keratitis.
Although antimicrobial therapy is an essential part of treatment, bacterial and host factors are of major importance in determining clinical outcome.
And dependence on antimicrobials has led to increasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
New strategies are needed to identify and develop new drug targets.
We have shown using genotyping that P.
aeruginosa isolates associated with keratitis tend to cluster as a distinct sub-population within the wider population structure of P.
aeruginosa .
However, so far our approach has been relatively crude.
Recent advances in genotyping techniques offer improved resolution and we are investigating whether they could be used to offer more personalized and targeted treatment.
This approach might be ideal in keratitis where treatments can be delivered topically and directly to the cornea.
As part of the ongoing UK Microbiology Ophthalmic Group we have isolates from 658 cases of P.
aeruginosa keratitis together with antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, clinical outcome information, and associated risk factors such as contact lens wear.
This is a unique collection, essentially representing a nation’s burden of disease for a specific infection type associated with a single pathogen.
We are genetically characterizing the entire collection of keratitis-associated isolates of P.
aeruginosa using WGS.
The datawill be linked to the P.aeruginosa 1000 Genomes Project which is aiming to define the diversity of the whole P.aeruginosa population worldwide from multiple clinical and environmental sources.
The macula is a highly sensitive area at the centre of the retina, where the light sensitive cells (the photoreceptors) are most densely packed.
Although perhaps less than 1.5mm in diameter, this part of the retina provides the high acuity vision that allows us to read, drive, recognise faces, read signs – many of the things that are most important to us.
Unfortunately a number of relatively common conditions (like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular oedema) affect the function of the cells at the macula, leading to visual disability.
The good news is that there are excellent new treatments for these conditions.
The eventual outcome of these treatments is best if problems are detected early and treatment commenced as soon as possible.
So we are investigating new ways of detecting diseases of the macula.
In the EDiMaD project we are investigating a shape discrimination test which runs on a small handheld device.
We are following 200 patients being treated for wet AMD in one eye, and testing their other eye when they come for their treatment.
We know that in a proportion of patients this other eye will develop the condition during the follow-up period.
This will allow us to establish how good the new test is at detecting the development of the new disease.
We are now extending investigations of the test to patients who are suspected of having diabetic macular oedema (EDDMO).
The growing computing and optical capabilities of mobile devices provides a potentially inexpensive means of obtaining, analysing, storing and transmitting images of the retina at the back of the eye.
We are investigating the images obtained with a number of smartphone-based devices.
Changes to the optic disc (the part of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye) are useful in detecting and monitoring glaucoma, a potentially blinding condition.
We have been obtaining images of the optic disk in both dilated and undilated eyes of glaucoma patients, and comparing them to dilated images obtained with a standard fundus camera.
We are currently grading a large set of images for quality.
The next step is to experiment with automated analysis of gradable images.
By exploiting the computing power in smartphones, combining imaging with automatic image analysis, it might be possible to provide a quick, effective and inexpensive screening tool for glaucoma.
This five year research programme aims to develop a major enhancement to the existing screening process for sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR, STDR) for implementation in the NHS.
