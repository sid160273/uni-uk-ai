This webpage serves as our Comprehensive Source of Information required by the Office for Students (OfS registration condition E6).
Harassment is behaviour or actions that are unwelcome, unwarranted and cause a detrimental effect to wellbeing.
Harassment can also apply to a group of people as well as individuals and can include unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct or can be online/facilitated by technology such as social media pages, networking sites, personal web pages, emails, text messages, blogs whether private, personal or public.
A list of further examples of harassment can be found in the Student Bullying and Harassment Policy (section 5.7).
Sexual misconduct is an umbrella term used to represent a range of behaviours which can include, but is not limited to, rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, ‘revenge porn’ or image-based sexual abuse, indecent exposure, stalking, and coercive and controlling behaviour.
It does not necessarily have to occur in person (e.g.
this can occur online) and is characterised by an absence of consent.
A list of further examples of sexual misconduct can be found in the Student Sexual Misconduct Policy (section 41).
At Lancaster University, we understand how experiences of sexual misconduct and harassment can detrimentally affect someone.
We have several support services and reporting options available to help.
It’s important to remember, you do not have to formally report an incident to receive support from university services.
If you choose to share information about an incident, you’ll be able to discuss the details about what happened with an appropriate professional who can offer you relevant information, advice and guidance on support services and reporting processes should you wish to formally report the incident later.
This will not automatically start formal procedures.
The information you share will be handled sensitively and wherever possible, we will respect the right of the individual disclosing an experience to choose whether and how to take forward a disclosure and make a formal report.
If you want to share information about your experience of harassment or sexual misconduct with the University, you can do so by submitting a Unisafe report .
Unisafe allows you to share information yourself, or on behalf of another person and you can choose whether to provide contact details or to report anonymously.
Staff can also report on behalf of students.
Unisafe is managed by a team of qualified Student Wellbeing professionals who will reach out to you within three working days of your submission with an offer of a follow up in-person or online meeting.
Please be aware that if you choose to report anonymously, we won't have a way of responding to you or offering you direct support.
Out of hours, students who wish to make a disclosure are advised to contact the Security team (01524 510090).
You can also disclose any incidents to other members of university staff if this feels more comfortable (for example your College or your academic department/tutor).
They can help you to liaise with Student Wellbeing Services who can advise you on how to access appropriate support.
Experiencing harassment or sexual misconduct can be very distressing; the university strongly encourages students to access support available to them either through the University’s internal Student Wellbeing Services, or via external services, all of which are outlined below.
Experiencing harassment or sexual misconduct can be very distressing, the University strongly encourages staff to access available support.
If you are a member of staff who has experienced harassment or sexual misconduct, you can get support from the free and confidential Employee Assistance Programme which can be accessed through the Wellbeing Portal .
You can view a full list of policies on our policies and regulations webpage.
More information about inclusivity can be accessed on our EDI inclusivity webpages .
If you require historic versions of these policies, please contact the policy owner, outlining your request and they’ll be able to share them with you directly.
You can find the name of the policy owner on the first page of the relevant policies.
If you have experienced, or witnessed, unacceptable behaviour by a student of Lancaster University, you can report it so that appropriate action can be taken.
If you suspect a Lancaster University student has committed a crime, you should first consider reporting it to the Police.
We understand that contacting the Police can itself feel a little intimidating, but the University can provide you with support before, during and after the process.
It is important to understand that a report to the University is not equivalent to making a report to the Police.
If you decide to report the incident to the Police after the University has begun its own investigation, it may have a negative impact on a criminal case.
It’s therefore important to think as early as you can about whether you wish to report the incident to the Police.
Incidents of sexual misconduct and harassment are considered major breaches of student discipline regulations and students are encouraged to report these to the Student Conduct Office.
It is the Student Conduct Office's role to receive complaints of serious misconduct and to determine whether they should be responded to through the University-level process, in accordance with the Student Discipline Regulations.
If the Student Conduct Office decides that a complaint should be considered at University Level, they will first undertake a risk assessment to decide whether any immediate actions are required to mitigate any immediate risks to the reporting and/or reported parties, or any other members of the University community.
They will then appoint an Investigating Officer to gather evidence and statements from the reporting and reported student(s), and any witnesses.
The Investigating Officer will then prepare a report for presentation to the Board of Discipline.
You can email the Student Conduct Office to make a report at studentconduct@lancaster.ac.uk .
The Student Conduct Office will then contact you to talk to you about next steps.
If you’re unsure about whether to make a report, you can discuss your options with the Student Conduct Office informally who are happy to meet and discuss options.
Alternatively, you can contact the Student Wellbeing Incident Support Service.
They can advise you on your options and support you throughout the disciplinary procedure should you choose to proceed with a report.
To contact this service, you can submit a Unisafe report, and they will be in touch within 3 working days with an offer of a follow-up meeting.
Students can make a formal report of sexual misconduct or harassment and remain anonymous.
We understand that you may be worried about reporting an incident of sexual misconduct or harassment and therefore, wish to keep your details private during the student discipline process.
While you can report anonymously, the University will be less likely to proceed with formal action based on an anonymous report.
You should also be aware that, while the Student Conduct Office is committed to protecting students’ anonymity, when a report is made anonymously, it will sometimes be possible for the reported student to identify who has made the allegations based on the details of the incident.
More information can be found about reporting .
Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect in their workplace.

Students studying for a Lancaster Award at a regional or international partnership are encouraged to review their local provider’s Comprehensive Source of Information for guidance on support services, training opportunities and reporting processes specific to their setting.
We understand that reporting a member of staff for incidents of harassment and sexual misconduct can seem daunting, but the university has systems in place to support you in doing this.
It’s important to remember that you will not be subject to any punishment for making a genuine report against a member of staff.
If you are a student and you want to report a staff member, you can submit a complaint via the Student Complaints process.
You can do this by filling out a Student Complaints Form or emailing complaints@lancaster.ac.uk .
You can find out more about the complaint procedure .
If you are a staff member and you want to report another member of staff, you can contact the Anti-Harassment and Bullying Team or share information with your line manager who can provide guidance on how to share a report with People and Organisational Effectiveness (the University’s Human Resource division).
If this isn’t an appropriate option, you can submit a Unisafe report with your contact details.
This will result in a member of the Employee Relations team getting in contact to support you through the reporting process.
If you are reported as being involved with an incident of harassment or sexual misconduct, an investigation may be carried out to determine if you have committed any breaches in student policies and you are expected to work with the University throughout these processes.
A member of the Student Conduct Office will reach out to you to:
You have the right to a fair, credible investigation that follows proper procedure.
You are also entitled to support from the Student Wellbeing Incident Support Service who can be contacted by submitting a Unisafe report with your contact details and sharing details of the incidents you have been reportedly involved with.
If you choose to get support, a team member can:
You can also access advice and support from LUSU who can provide impartial, non-judgmental advice.
They can also help you navigate the University's regulations and processes.
Accessing support doesn't mean admitting guilt - it means looking after yourself during what can be a very stressful time.
Maintaining confidentiality is a key principle in creating a culture where those affected by harassment and sexual misconduct feel safe to share information about incidents they have experienced.
Information received in connection with incidents of harassment and/or sexual misconduct will be handled sensitively and always used fairly.
The University will take all reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality and privacy of those who share information about harassment and sexual misconduct and will seek to obtain consent to share information with the affected student and to be led by their wishes.
However, to ensure a fair investigation that follows proper procedure and reflects the principle of natural justice.
the university will have to share some information with a reported party during disciplinary processes (such as the reporting party’s statement.) The Student Conduct Office team can provide information about how sensitive and personal data is used during disciplinary proceedings.
Additionally, there will be circumstances (e.g.
to protect an individual at risk) where we are required to share information with selected senior colleagues or other agencies.
In these circumstances, consent will only be breached in exceptional cases where there is genuine risk to safety, or where there is a safeguarding or other legal concern.
We will follow our protocols on breaching consent and document our decision-making if it is decided that we need to share information.
Personal details will be deleted in line with the University's student data retention policy.
For more information about how the University uses and secures your personal data, please visit our Student Privacy Notice .

New sentences found on https://lancaster.ac.uk/news/lancaster-professor-calls-for-more-action-to-protect-the-ozone-layer:
As the first group of scientists to compare data sets from both ground-based instruments and satellites, the international team - including Lancaster University - found an unexpected discrepancy.
The international team included Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry Ryan Hossaini from Lancaster Environment Centre with Dr Susann Tegtmeier and Dr Kimberlee Dube from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, among others.
Their research published in Nature Communications Earth and Environment examined the amount of chlorine in the stratosphere using satellite data and compared this to the expected amount from ground-based measurements of now banned chlorine-containing gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
The stratosphere is the second closest layer of atmosphere to the Earth’s surface and is one of five distinct layers of the atmosphere which protects life on Earth.
But certain chemicals released into the air can damage ozone in this layer.
Increasing levels of chlorine in the upper atmosphere can compromise its integrity, leading to “holes” or areas of less ozone that can leave Earth more vulnerable to the sun’s rays.
For decades, researchers have been focused on preventing and reversing this damage.
Dr Susann Tegtmeier from the University of Saskatchewan said: “In the 1980s, when it was discovered that the ozone layer was beginning to thin, researchers set out to understand the process, which eventually led to the creation of the Montreal Protocol, a policy which limited the use of certain chemicals that damage the ozone layer.
Chlorine is one of those chemicals that destroy ozone and we’ve been measuring its level in the atmosphere to see the rate it’s decreasing.”
Over the past few decades, a reduction in chlorinated long-lived ozone-depleting substance emissions due to the regulations imposed by the Montreal Protocol has led to a global decrease in stratospheric chlorine.
At the same time, emissions of chlorinated Very Short-Lived Substances, which are unregulated, have increased.
Scientists rely on a ground-based measurement network to monitor the lower atmosphere and satellites to measure higher layers like the stratosphere.
While the ground-based measurements show the expected decrease in chlorine, the satellites have found chlorine levels in the stratosphere to be higher than expected and decreasing at a slower rate.
Satellite observations of stratospheric chlorine species from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment—Fourier Transform Spectrometer during 2004–2020 revealed that the observed decrease in inorganic stratospheric chlorine is 25%–30% smaller than expected based on trends of long-lived ozone-depleting substances alone.
At mid-latitudes in the lower stratosphere, this can be explained by the chlorinated Very Short-Lived Substances increase, which offsets the long-term reduction of stratospheric chlorine by up to 30%.
Professor Ryan Hossaini from Lancaster Environment Centre said: “Our new findings provide further compelling evidence that uncontrolled emissions of halogenated Very Short-Lived Substances are offsetting some of the Montreal Protocol’s benefits.
A timely recovery of the ozone layer should not be taken for granted and a concerted international effort is now needed to establish the sources of these gases and to identify whether action is required.”
Professor Hossaini and his team performed simulations with a global atmospheric model to interpret the satellite data in this new study.
His work has previously warned that growing emissions of Very Short-Lived Substances, including the common solvent dichloromethane, may delay recovery of the ozone layer .
Our new findings provide further compelling evidence that uncontrolled emissions of halogenated Very Short-Lived Substances are offsetting some of the Montreal Protocol’s benefits.
A timely recovery of the ozone layer should not be taken for granted and a concerted international effort is now needed to establish the sources of these gases and to identify whether action is required

Facing a team from the University of Lincoln in the first round will be team captain Lex Wiggins, who has just graduated from Lancaster in Mathematics, History student Talhah Hussain, Josie Hyland, who studies Philosophy, Politics and Economics and Eoin Neale, who studies Physics.
Waiting in the wings as team reserve is Medicine student Fatima Al Sharef.
The Lancaster team will compete in the pre-recorded, first-round match of the new season, which started in July, to be broadcast on BBC2 on Monday, September 1 at 8.30pm.
Asking the questions will be presenter Amol Rajan.
Team captain Lex Wiggins said it was a great honour to be part of Lancaster University’s first University Challenge team since 2019 but that taking part in the pre-recorded contest was proving to be a tricky secret to keep.
“At the start of the last academic year I'd only dreamed of being on the show and, when I signed up for the intercollege quiz trials, I thought the University Challenge bit was a fun bonus,” said Lex, who was a Lancaster University student at the time of the first round.
“It still doesn't feel real!
“Even though most of us only met each other for the first time at the selection competition in November, we really got on.
Before the audition I think we were all pretty nervous and had no idea what the competition would be like.
“But after we found out we made it to the TV rounds we were a lot less nervous because we'd already done something great.”
The team practised every week at Lancaster University’s QuizSoc, did pub quizzes together, and sent teams to QuizBowl events around the country with the other QuizSoc members.
“Lincoln were really good opponents, and it was lovely chatting to them before we filmed the match in Salford,” added Lex.
“I also have to say that we couldn't have done it without QuizSoc, which was only formed in late 2023 and has made our quizzing culture at Lancaster bigger than ever, and Lancaster University Students’ Union (LUSU), who put a really thorough selection process in place and went the extra mile this year.”
Series Producer Clare Parody, of Media City-based Lifted Entertainment who produce the show, said: “We hope very much that the team will enjoy the broadcast of their first-round match.
We greatly enjoyed working with them and think they should be extremely proud of their achievements in the competition.”
University Challenge first aired in 1962 and was hosted by Bamber Gascoigne.

Dr Cath Hill, who lectures in Social Work at Lancaster University, will take part in the event on August 21 and is one of just five people selected to take part in a panel discussion, entitled ‘United by Hope: Collective Action for Victims of Terrorism’, as part of the high-level UN event.
Dr Hill set up The Bee The Difference research project after the Manchester Arena attack in 2017 which she survived along with her son, who was just 10 at the time.
The UN’s General Assembly declared August 21 the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism and invited all Member States, organisations of the United Nations system, as well as other international organisations and civil society entities, including non-governmental organizations and individuals, to observe the International Day in an appropriate manner.
The focus is to honour, remember, and pay tribute to the victims of terrorism, stand in solidarity with them, and promote and protect their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
This year’s theme ‘United by Hope: Collective Action for Victims of Terrorism’, is inspired by members of the Victims of Terrorism Associations Network and emphasises the hope that emerges when victims come together to transform pain into purpose.
The pre-recorded event will feature a high-level segment and a panel discussion showcasing the power of collaboration among victims and survivors.
This will open with statements from senior United Nations officials and representatives of Member States including a pre-recorded message from the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and a Global Minute of Silence.
The ensuing panel will bring together five victims and survivors of terrorism from diverse regional and personal backgrounds who are actively leading change within their communities, across borders, and through international advocacy
Through personal experiences and collaborative examples, panellists will explore how collective leadership can drive meaningful change.
The session will highlight the power of victim and survivors’ leadership, the need for meaningful participation in decision-making, and how working together can transform pain into purpose.
The 40-minute structured discussion will conclude with a round of powerful closing messages from the speakers — a collective call to action addressed to the international community.
“It is such an honour to be invited by The United Nations to take part in this important panel to discuss the importance of positive collective action after terrorism and highlight some of the outputs and impact from our research,” said Dr Hill.
“It was such a privilege to work with the young survivors involved in the Bee the Difference research and to make positive change in the UK and to have this recognised on an international stage is wonderful.”
In August 2022 nine young Manchester survivors, in collaboration with Dr Hill and the National Emergencies Trust , launched the Bee The Difference survey, which was completed by 236 young people (aged under 18 at the time of the attack).
Respondents included those impacted by what happened to a loved one or friend, as well as those who were present at the Arena when the attack happened .
90% of those who took part in the survey were at the Arena, or in the vicinity, when the attack occurred, and the research looked at their experiences and after care.
The event will be broadcast live (3pm BST August 21) and on-demand on UN WebTV : bit.ly/UnitedbyHope_VoT

A new kind of stellar explosion provides a novel way to probe the distant Universe, according to new results published today in Nature Astronomy .
Researchers from Lancaster University joined a global team, led by Radboud University, Netherlands, examining ‘Fast X-ray transients (FXTs)’ which are highly mysterious outbursts of X-ray radiation, typically lasting for just a few minutes.
"We've known that these unique explosions exist for some time, but it is only now, thanks to the new Einstein Probe mission, that we can pinpoint them in near real time", says astronomer Professor Peter Jonker, of Radboud University, Netherlands, discoverer of one of the first such events, and second author of today's paper.
The authors used a precise position provided first by an X-ray space telescope, the Einstein Probe, and refined on the ground by the ATLAS optical telescope to pinpoint the Fast X-ray Transient in space through observations with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Grantecan Telescope in Spain.
"These observations show that this explosion happened when the Universe was less than 10 per cent of its current age - the light has been travelling to us for 12 billion years,” says Professor Andrew Levan, of Radboud University, and first author of the study.
“The combination of the distance and the brightness means this explosion gave off more energy in a few seconds than the Sun will over its entire life.
“These extreme energies, along with the detection of gamma-rays by the Fermi satellite, suggest that the Fast X-ray Transients are related, at least sometimes, to the extremely powerful gamma-ray bursts that have been studied for half a century.”
"A real question is if all of the Fast X-ray Transients come from gamma-ray burst-like systems, or if there is much more diversity.
Our paper shows that many of them might be gamma-ray bursts, but there are good reasons to think there is much more still to discover", added Professor Jonker.
When examining the observations from the Very Large Telescope, it became apparent that there is very little material, particularly hydrogen, surrounding this burst.
Hydrogen acts like a filter for ultraviolet light, blocking it from passing through the Universe.
However, in the history of the Universe, around the time of this Fast X-ray Transient, the Universe underwent its last global change in a process called reionisation, where the hydrogen between galaxies was hit with ultraviolet light and ‘reionised’.
The challenge is that almost all the ultraviolet light created by stars in the Universe is blocked by hydrogen in the galaxy in which it sits.
"Our observations show that perhaps 10% of the ultraviolet light created in the host galaxy of the Fast X-ray Transient is escaping to ionise the Universe,” said Andrea Saccardi, CNES Fellow at CEA Paris-Saclay, and third author of the paper.
“This is the most distant event where we can directly see light escaping from around stars.
Galaxies like this are probably really important for reionisation.”
These observations are of one of the first events detected by the Einstein Probe.
"In the year since this first object we have found and studied another 20 of these outbursts, they are living up to their promise as an exciting new way to explore both how stars end their lives, and also what the Universe was like in the distant past", added Professor Levan.
Research co-author and Lecturer in Astrophysics at Lancaster University Dr Samantha Oates was part of the research team.
She said: “This event is novel and interesting because only a handful of FXTs had been discovered until very recently, and their origin was a mystery, primarily because they had been found in archival observations.
“By the time they were discovered, it was too late to perform follow-up of these transient X-ray objects at other wavelengths to get other information about what might be causing them.”
The Einstein Probe, launched in January 2024, is, says Dr Oates, revolutionising the detection and follow-up of FXTs, which are now regularly detected, and the community is alerted quickly, enabling rapid follow-up.
She added: “The Einstein Probe has opened up a new window on the universe, allowing us to probe the origin of these transient X-ray phenomena and widen our knowledge of the behaviour associated with the deaths of massive stars.”

The Big Windermere Survey (BWS) saw 350 citizen scientists collect more than 1,000 samples of water from Windermere and its wider catchment, during 10 sampling events spread across 2.5 years.
Many of the 110 locations sampled had never previously been assessed for water quality.
The water samples were analysed for 15 key water quality parameters.
The focus of the report published today is on the concentrations of phosphorus and the bacteria Escherichia coli ( E.
coli ) and Intestinal Enterococci (IE), critical indicators of ecosystem health and of the quality of water for lake users.
Within their analyses, scientists grouped sampling locations around Windermere’s lakeshore into four areas - Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and Southeast.
Water quality within each of these areas was then examined both seasonally and across the entire 2.5-year project.
The BWS report reveals that concentrations of E.
coli and IE bacteria were highest in the summer months, at times when Windermere is especially popular for activities such as bathing and watersports.
Based on the report data, concentrations of bacteria in the Northwest, Northeast and Southwest areas of the lake in summer were only consistent with standards for ‘Poor’ bathing water quality.
The elevated bacterial concentrations in summer are particularly concerning as they indicate an increased risk of gastro-intestinal illness if water is ingested.
In spring, autumn and winter seasons, lower concentrations of E.
coli and IE were consistent with standards for ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ bathing water quality across all areas of Windermere.
Escherichia coli and IE are two groups of bacteria found in human and animal faeces.
These bacteria can enter water from many different sources, including releases of treated wastewater from water company and private infrastructure, untreated sewage, runoff from agricultural land that hosts livestock, or via inputs from wildlife and birds that live in and around water.
All areas of Windermere were found to meet standards for ‘Moderate’ phosphorus status under UK legislation.
This indicates that concentrations of phosphorus within the lake were higher than those required to meet the default target of ‘Good’ phosphorus status under this legislation.
Phosphorus primarily enters lakes through discharges of wastewater and runoff from agricultural or forestry land that has received inputs of phosphorus, such as from fertilisers.
Elevated concentrations of phosphorus are of concern because they can trigger the process of eutrophication, resulting in negative changes within lakes.
These changes include increased risks of cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) blooms, and decreases in dissolved oxygen concentrations in water that can threaten fish and other organisms living in lakes.
Beyond Windermere itself, the BWS also offers detailed insights into the water quality of rivers and other lakes across the wider Leven catchment.
Hotspots for the concentrations of phosphorus or bacteria are revealed around Windermere’s shoreline at Waterhead, Millerground, Bowness Bay, Belle Isle, Mitchell Wyke Bay, southwestern shore sites, and near the River Leven outflow.
Streams and rivers including Stock Ghyll, Black Beck, Mill Beck, Wilfin Beck and locations along the River Rothay also showed elevated concentrations of phosphorus or bacteria.
Simon Johnson, Executive Director, of The Freshwater Biological Association, said: “We are incredibly grateful to the hundreds of volunteers who have given thousands of hours of their time to gather the scientific data in this report.
The evidence is clear and must lead to decisive action to improve water quality.
We must all work together to transform the future of Windermere and deliver a cleaner, healthier and safer waterbody for all life to thrive.
“Windermere is home to a number of rare and increasingly threatened freshwater species including Arctic charr.
Without decisive action to improve water quality, this species and potentially many more will face a steady and devastating decline.
“We hope these findings will not only advance scientific understanding of Windermere’s water quality but also play a pivotal role in shaping future strategies to protect and enhance the health of the lake and its surrounding catchment.”
Dr Ben Surridge, a Senior Lecturer at Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, said:“The Big Windermere Survey is a unique collaboration between professional scientists and members of various communities with an interest in the water quality of Windermere and its catchment.
“This collaboration has generated an unprecedented dataset which offers new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in Windermere, built on exactly the same robust, scientific approaches used in water quality research.
“We look forward to working with partners within the catchment to ensure that evidence generated by the Big Windermere Survey informs action that leads to real improvement in the water quality of this iconic lake.”
The team behind the Big Windermere Survey is calling for data from the project to underpin actions that address the multiple pressures on water quality in Windermere’s catchment.
These pressures include wastewater, both from water company assets and from privately managed systems, as well as land use activities within both rural and urban areas of the catchment.
All land owners, farmers and asset owners have a collective responsibility to work together to improve Windermere’s water quality.
The team will continue to work to ensure that the following actions are taken as a result of the findings published today.
They will:
The data from the Big Windermere Survey are being actively shared with a range of organisations both locally and nationally, as part of on-going conversations about the water quality of Windermere.

New sentences found on https://lancaster.ac.uk/news/spotlight/cream-of-the-crop:
This daunting task is something eminent researchers from Lancaster University’s Environment Centre (LEC) have taken on, gaining them global recognition for finding solutions to major environmental problems.
With more than 9 billion mouths to feed by 2050, Professor Emeritus Martin Parry who developed Plant Science for Food Security in LEC a decade ago, has spent his career trying to increase the yield of major crops, and increasing efficiencies of production and also quality.He believes one way to do this is to increase photosynthesis of crops such as wheat by understanding how yield and quality are determined by genes and plant reactions to different environments.
Professor Parry said: “We know we need to increase crop production worldwide and do this using fewer resources.
Our research has suggested to meet food demand by 2050 we need to close yield gaps and increase global crop yields by 70-110 per cent.
“Add to this climate change and extreme weather meaning high and low temperatures, droughts and flooding alongside increased air pollution, and it means our plants are going to face extreme stresses that will hinder growth and crop yields.
“We need to make our plants and crops more resilient to these stresses.
Our aim is to understand how gene composition and sequencing in different environments such as drought affects crop yield and how we can manipulate these genes to improve photosynthesis and inform natural selection leading to improvements in future crop generations.”
Professor Parry’s research includes the RIPE project (Realising Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency) part funded by the Gates Foundation to increase the yield of staple food crops in developing countries.
As one of the first people to genetically engineer Rubisco, an enzyme that activates the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO₂) into sugars, Professor Parry led a team focussed on making Rubisco more efficient.
Photograph: This photo and header image are courtesy of the RIPE project at the Carl R.
Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Professor Parry said: “Rubisco is the first enzyme involved in carbon fixation but it’s also inefficient because it can bind with oxygen which wastes energy instead of binding with carbon dioxide which the plant converts into much needed glucose that helps it grow.
“Binding with oxygen results in wasted carbon and energy in photorespiration.
Rubisco is abundant in plants but is also a slow enzyme.
For example, if we could speed it up then we wouldn’t need as much nitrogen (widely used as a fertiliser) for photosynthesis, to support high crop yields.”
This enzyme is the lifetime research passion of colleague Professor of Crop Physiology Elizabete Carmo-Silva who was recently named one of the world’s most influential academics (Clarivate Highly Cited) and Deputy Director of the RIPE project alongside leading the Photosynthesis Team within LEC.
Like Professor Parry, her research aims to understand and improve the efficiency of photosynthesis to sustainably enhance crop productivity and climate resilience.
Professor Elizabete Carmo-Silva
One key focus has been on the relationship between light levels and Rubisco activation.
Professor Carmo-Silva said: “The amount of light determines the amount of energy available for CO₂ assimilation.
Plants in the field experience not only day and night but also leaves in the canopy transition frequently between shade and full sun.
“Rubisco takes quite a few minutes to adjust when leaves switch from shade to high light.
During those minutes, the leaf isn’t assimilating as much CO₂ as it has the light energy for, so there is a substantial loss.”
Why there is this time lag in the light response of Rubisco has led Prof Carmo-Silva and her team to explore variations across various plant crops.
A cowpea crop
Recent research has focused on cowpea, a legume grown widely in sub–Saharan Africa that is critical for food security.
Alongside Lecturer in Plant Science Dr Samuel Taylor, they found that as cowpea leaves go into shade the Rubisco activity drops in just a couple of minutes, which is much more rapidly than was previously thought.
By recording the ‘lag’ when a shaded leaf comes back into light and the several minutes it takes to get going they estimate that plants lose 20 per cent of potential carbon dioxide uptake each day.
To further compound this slow response to changes in light, the assimilation of CO₂ by Rubisco is impaired when crop plants experience heat stress.
A drought-stricken corn field.
Professor Carmo-Silva said: “At temperatures observed during heatwaves, the Rubisco enzyme becomes inactivated and unable to continue assimilating CO2 into sugars for the plant to grow, resulting in lower crop yields.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have years to let plants naturally evolve and adapt to the increasing frequency of heatwaves and other climate extremes.
“By examining the physiology of the crop plants in response to these environmental cues we can hopefully create new sets of seeds that are more productive and resilient to climate changes.”
And the global challenge of water conservation is a topic close to the heart of Australian Professor of Sustainable Agriculture Ian Dodd.
Professor Dodd said: “I am focused on trying to deliver ‘more crop per drop’ within cropping systems.
Globally, agriculture uses more than 70 per cent of the world’s fresh water, with unsustainable water use threatening vulnerable ecosystems and compromising food security.
“As a plant scientist, I’m most interested in how plant root systems sense their environment and transmit long-distance signals to the shoot to regulate growth and water use.”
Professor Dodd is involved in many global research projects hoping to support food production in a changing climate and focusses on the volume, frequency, and placement of water.
A field in West Africa.
His research includes a major study on different wet and drying irrigation techniques in Ghana, which can sustain crop yields while reducing water use in important crops such as rice (the most water-demanding crop).
He is also working with industry to develop more sustainable fertiliser sources, a topical issue with the price of synthetic chemical fertilisers more than doubling in the last year due to the Ukraine war.
Collaboration is at the heart of all research and as a leading voice in Agri-Food challenges, Lancaster’s Plant Biology Group works closely with industry, plant breeders, farmers, manufacturers, and policy makers to bring about real changes improving food production and crop security worldwide.
Meanwhile closer to home the University is constantly improving the sustainability of its food provision on campus including using local suppliers to cut food miles, using Farm Assured meat and promoting seasonal and plant-based menus.
To tackle food waste on campus, surplus food is offered at discount prices via the Too Good to Go app which also supports the cost of living for students and reusable steel kegs supply milk to some of the outlets on campus, which saves on hundreds of plastic milk bottles over the year.

Lancaster University is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.
This section covers issues that we need to fix .
The issues listed in this section refer to both the platform (https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/) and the content hosted within.
These issues affect the Moodle platform as a whole, across all pages.
Some images have alternative text that duplicates the content of a text link inside or beside them (WCAG: 1.1.1).
Some pages include lists which contain elements that will make the list difficult to interpret by screen readers (WCAG: 1.3.1).
Some pages may contain elements with low contrast between the elements and its background particularly when under focus (WCAG: 1.4.11).
The colour of some text does not sufficiently contrast with its background colour, so come people with moderate visual impairments may not be able to read it.
(WCAG: 1.4.3).
Some components are not far enough apart from other interactive areas, which will make it easier for users to click on the wrong component by mistake (WCAG: 2.5.8).
Some links point to anchors that do not exist (WCAG: 2.4.1).
Some optional fields on some forms do not identify their purpose programmatically.
This means that not all fields will be able to autofill (WCAG: 1.3.5)
These issues will only be found on specific page types, such as e.g.
the forum page.
Some pages contain frames without a title attribute.
Screen reader users rely on a frame title to describe the contents of a frame (WCAG: 2.4.1, 4.1.2).
Some links have not been labelled clearly.
This means that the links do not make sense when they are taken out of context, and for some links it is not possible to know what the purpose of the link is (WCAG: 2.4.4).
Table headers on some pages do not have a valid scope attribute, so it won’t always be possible for assistive technologies to tell what the header refers to (e.g.
row or column) (WCAG: 1.3.1).
Some elements on some pages have duplicate ID attributes which may affect the performance of some assistive technologies (WCAG: 4.1.1)
Some fieldsets may not have a legend that describes their contents (WCAG: 1.3.1).
These issues relate to content uploaded to Moodle by users.
Some documents may contain text with low contrast between the text and its background.
This can cause the text to be difficult to read, especially for those with low vision, poor eyesight, or colour blindness.
Some documents may contain informative images that do not have a description or alternative text.
People with screen readers or other assistive devices rely on these descriptions to understand the image content and purpose.
Some PDF documents have not been appropriately tagged.
PDF tags are hidden labels that clarify the structure of the document and define which elements are headings, paragraphs, tables, lists, etc.
Some documents may not contain marked-up headings which provide structure to a document.
Some documents are either entirely scanned or contain pages that are scanned.
Screen readers may therefore be unable to convert these images into words, even if the image only consists of text.
Users can create OCRed conversions of such documents using Ally.
This section covers issues that we cannot fix right now .
We’ve assessed the cost of fixing these issues but believe that doing so would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the law.
From September 2020, all video recordings included as teaching materials should have automated captions, and all recorded content created before September 2020 must have captions added if used for teaching after this date.
Audio-only content, such as podcasts, do not currently require captioning but a transcript of the content should be provided alongside the link to the audio.
Some recorded content may not have captions by default.
All video recording applications used at Lancaster have the ability to produce auto-captions, the accuracy of which is generally good (i.e.
> 90%) but can be affected by numerous factors.
As with any automated speech recognition system, there may be some errors in the speech to text conversion process.
Automatically generated captions are briefly checked for major inaccuracies and in most cases, any errors will be minor and won’t affect the overall learning for those who use closed captions.
Fully accurate captions will be provided to any students who have disclosed an appropriate disability or impairment.
We have assessed the cost of fixing all incorrect captions.
We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.

This award highlights Professor Higgitt’s leadership in advancing both scientific research and policy dialogue throughout East and Southeast Asia and was formally presented at the AOGS conference opening ceremony on Monday 28 July.
Professor Higgitt will deliver his medal lecture, “On Nature-based Solutions and Human Nature: Geosciences in Uncertain Times,” at the conference on Friday 1 August.
The lecture aims to explore how new technologies are making it easier to use nature-based solutions for social problems, even as science and environmental care face growing attacks and public interest is fading.
Professor Higgitt has been based in Asia for 20 years, previously a Professor at National University of Singapore and has long standing involvement in geosciences in Asia.
The conference and receipt of the medal falls in Professor Higgitt’s last week as Academic Dean at BJTU following an eight-year tenure that has overseen growth on the Weihai campus, which began with just 250 students and now educates 2,000 undergraduates, projected to reach 3,000 within four years.
Reflecting on his time at BJTU Professor Higgitt talks about the development of both the campus and the city: “The university campus was established as a catalyst for the development of a new city, Nanhai.
As such there was very limited development when our staff first arrived, making it an extremely challenging place to live and work.”
“Little by little, the local area has developed.
Our BJTU colleagues have been generous in supporting LU staff.
It is very pleasing to see how a strong sense of community has developed among the LU staff.”
In recognition of his contribution to the development of the campus and its socio-economic and cultural impact, Professor Higgitt was awarded Honorary Citizenship in 2021 and the Weihai Friendship Award in 2022.
Professor Simon Guy, Pro-Vice-Chancellor Global at Lancaster University said: “David’s work in geosciences and transnational education have made a valuable contribution to Lancaster’s international profile.
His long-standing commitment to collaborative research and teaching have helped strengthen our partnership with BJTU and our reputation in China.
The Wing Ip Medal is a well-deserved recognition of his sustained efforts.”
This autumn, Professor Higgitt returns to Lancaster’s Bailrigg campus, returning to his position as Professor in Lancaster Environment Centre, having helped establish Lancaster as a “premier league” institution in Sino-foreign partnerships, one of just 16 named by the China Joint Education Committee in 2025.
Last year, LUC@BJTU hosted the UK–China Joint Institute Alliance conference in Weihai, welcoming over 200 leaders from current and prospective UK–China joint institutes.
Professor Christine Mortimer will take on the role of Academic Dean at BJTU in the new academic year.
David’s work in geosciences and transnational education have made a valuable contribution to Lancaster’s international profile.

Twin for Hope was created by Universities UK International and Cormack Consultancy Group in 2022 to help partner UK and Ukraine universities following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
A new progress report on the initiative shows that 105 universities have since been twinned through the project, with £70 million generated for Ukrainian universities, and more than 50,000 students and staff directly engaged.
Many of the partnerships have developed long-term co-operation plans, with innovative programmes and targeted support helping Ukrainian universities move from crisis response to long-term renewal.
Chairman of Cormack Consultancy Group Charles Cormack said: “What began in 2022 as an urgent response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has evolved into what is arguably the most successful mobilisation of UK universities to support colleagues in another country.”
Lancaster University joined Twin for Hope to partner with Dnipro University of Technology.
Since 2022 the partnership has delivered research workshops on soil degradation and land restoration, created digital and in-person mobility opportunities for students, and funded fully-supported scholarships.
Researchers from Dnipro recently joined the annual Lancaster Education Conference 2025 online and plans for a visit to Lancaster in November for further knowledge exchange workshops.
The partnership has also provided mentorship on global profile-building, ensuring Ukrainian academia remains visible, connected and ready to lead.
Leading on the partnership at Lancaster University is Global Engagement Manager Tania Hughes.
Alongside Ben Matthews, Associate Director Global Engagement, Tania recently received a certificate of appreciation from the Twinning Team at Cormack Consultancy Group.
She said: “Our partnership with Dnipro University of Technology is a testament to the power of collaboration in crisis: from joint soil research to digital mobility schemes and building academic reputation, we’re safeguarding Ukraine’s academic future and championing its rightful recognition on the world stage.”

“It’s not even a real vaccine.
You can catch Covid and also spread it if you are vaccinated.
You don’t catch polio or MMR after you are vaccinated.”
This kind of comment found on Twitter/X is one example of a trend for ‘vaccine scepticism’ on social media, revealed by collaborative research led by Lancaster.
The findings are important in terms of shaping future public health communications and planning around vaccinations.
“This study was made possible by a collaboration between linguists at Lancaster and colleagues with complementary expertise at University College London and Georgetown University in Washington DC,” explained Professor Elena Semino in Lancaster’s Linguistics Department.
“The involvement of the UK Security Agency was also crucial in making sure that the study addressed relevant questions with regard to vaccine hesitancy and how it can be addressed.”
The research — drawing on a nine-million-word body of words or ‘corpus’, consisting of tweets containing references to the MMR vaccine posted between 2008 and 2022 — found that scepticism about the status of any vaccine being a real vaccine was very rarely expressed on Twitter before 2020.
“The finding that some people on Twitter/X question the status of the COVID-19 vaccines as vaccines was unexpected,” said Elena, “and shows the importance of explaining how different vaccines work, depending on the nature of the disease, how they modify disease rather than prevent infection for example.”

That’s important, because it should mean an easy route to mass upskilling and increased productivity, a narrowing of the gap in terms of the top and bottom performers in whatever task is involved: from software programming to people management.
But early evidence suggests people might be ignoring advice.
Why?
To test this idea, Lancaster University Management School’s Renaud Foucart and Maya Jalloul looked at the behaviours of a particular set of people faced with complex choices, people who would obviously benefit from the extra knowledge and insights of the masters: chess players.
Their research found that most people chose to stick to their own, initial ideas.
“It was the lower-ability chess players, the ones with the most to gain, who lost out from ignoring advice,” says Renaud.
“The most able players were also the most likely to follow expert suggestions when it benefited them — suggesting it may have been their tendency to listen to advice that made them better in the first place.”
The findings have wider implications for organisations and whole sectors looking at the use of AI, digital co-working and augmented reality technologies.
“The routine use of AI advice to improve writing or the gathering of information may not translate easily to sectors such as medicine or engineering where subjects have expertise and may want to trust it more at the moment of the decision than any advice they receive.
Critically, in terms of public policy, digital literacy and the means of telling good from bad advice will become even more important over time — with lower ability subjects being more at risk of using bad advice.”

New sentences found on https://lancaster.ac.uk/partners/news/smart-wind-turbines-check-the-weather-first-dr-sergio-campobasso:
Across Europe, more than 12% of energy supplies come from wind power.
The sheer scale of the wind energy network means efficiency is paramount.
Small losses in performance and kilowatt generation are quickly magnified.
Dr Sergio Campobasso , Senior Lecturer in the School of Engineering, is at the centre of an international, multidisciplinary team that is taking on one of the biggest challenges for wind energy: the erosion of turbine blades caused by atmospheric precipitation.
“Latest studies suggest that the erosion of wind turbine blades leads to an annual loss in energy output of between 0.5% and 4%,” says Sergio.
“Even a 0.5% loss constitutes a sizeable revenue loss, with cost implications in terms of lifetime return of investment.
Equally, or sometimes more importantly, there are maintenance, repair and downtime costs which are substantial, particularly when it comes to offshore installations.”
Recent and ongoing research using computational and experimental fluid dynamics has provided a clear picture of the significance of erosion and its implications for the energy sector globally.
“We then started looking into technologies to predict and mitigate blade erosion, working with data from the UK Met Office (Hazelrigg) weather station and wind turbine located on our campus.
This has led to new guidelines essential to developing turbine digital twins to predict erosion and optimise maintenance costs.”
The work is part of a targeted project run by the International Energy Agency involving a consortium of universities, research centres and engineering businesses from across 12 countries.
Lancaster has been working closely with DTU in Denmark, Cornell University in the US, and AIST in Japan, making use of expertise from other disciplines.
As a result, effective technologies for minimising erosion are under development.
“We are looking at adding and testing a further control element which senses weather conditions and allows the turbine to alter its rotational speed to avoid damage to the leading edge areas of the turbine blades.
Progressing our research and continuing to collaborate with our UK and overseas partners will enable new breakthroughs in this sector, crucial to the further growth of wind power in Europe and other sites with great erosion potential, such as East and South-east Asia.”

And, along the way, you can explore a host of different literary forms - such as, for example, ancient myth, Puritan sermon, nineteenth-century slave narrative, modernist epigram, and the contemporary graphic novel.
Acts of reading
The study of literature here is founded on the conviction that reading is not passive but active; it is something that acts upon both the texts that we read and the world in which we live.
Neither those texts nor the world are left the same as they were before.
This means that as well as encouraging and nurturing all kinds of established forms of literary scholarship, such as archival work, historicism, close reading, and literary theory, we are pioneers in experimental or creative forms of literary criticism.

A new international landscape lies ahead: international tensions and conflicts among the leading economies of the world, climate change and environmental emergencies, major issues of social justice and business ethics, as well as global economic pressures on limited resources of all kinds.
All management processes and business decisions, in all types of organisations and markets, have to face these new realities and their impact on societies, economies, and people’s everyday lives.
All employers are asking management and business schools for two essential things: on the one hand, graduates capable of understanding the multiple dimensions of contemporary management and business and their global connections; on the other, graduates with an understanding of the world in which business takes place, a world characterised by complex economic, political, and cultural processes.
This course offers a unique and genuine interdisciplinary understanding of management, its essentially international nature, and the realities of the world today.
Your studies will develop your critical understanding in three fundamental areas:
You will take modules from both the Management School, and Politics and International Relations - a unique feature of this degree.
There are two pathways through the degree: you can choose to focus either on marketing or accounting and finance.
You will, therefore, have the opportunity to choose additional modules from one of these disciplines.
In your second year, you will deepen and broaden your understanding of management and global business operations today, with modules in management and international organisations, human resource management, and business ethics.
These will be complemented with modules in international relations and world politics, security and sustainability, and the politics of development.
Your third year consists of a placement in industry that will allow you to apply your knowledge and develop professional skills.
In your final year, you’ll cover more issues surrounding international human resource management, management and organisations in the digital age, as well as sustainability, together with more optional modules in marketing management or corporate finance (depending on which route you’ve chosen), and international relations such as the Governance of Global Capitalism.
You will also synthesise your academic achievements in an individual dissertation, a much-valued addition to your professional resume.
This course offers our students an excellent appreciation of the many challenges modern businesses face today, in the real world, and those they will face in the future.

As part of our commitment to improving social mobility and widening access to higher education for all, we take a holistic approach to reviewing applications and aim to understand our applicants' circumstances and potential as much as possible.
The information on this page is relevant to our Contextual Offer Scheme for 2025 entry.
All degree courses are included in the Contextual Offer Scheme, with the exception of MBChB Medicine and Surgery, and Medicine and Surgery with a Gateway Year, which have a separate contextual offer scheme.
For more information on contextual offers for Medicine, please visit the Medical School website .
Our Contextual Offer Scheme aims to identify the potential of applicants whose personal circumstances may have impacted their achievement in education.
If you're applying to start your degree at Lancaster University, you could be eligible to receive our contextual offer in place of our typical offer.
As part of the Contextual Offer Scheme, your offer will typically be two A level grades (or equivalent) lower than the standard offer shown on our course pages and prospectus.
For example, a standard offer of AAB, would become BBB.
In addition, students eligible for the Contextual Offer Scheme will also receive the Lancaster Opportunity Scholarship of £1,000 per annum.
If you are applying for one of our degree courses with a Foundation Year , then you would not receive a lower offer as part of the Contextual Offer Scheme, but we will aim to be flexible when considering your entry qualifications.
For 2025 entry, we will take into account additional contextual information when reviewing applications from UK students, if either:
Eligible students, who apply through the main UCAS cycle, will qualify for the Contextual Offer Scheme, that is two A level grades (or equivalent) below our published entry grades.
There is no additional application process.
Once we receive your application from UCAS, we will automatically make an adjusted offer to all qualifying students and this will appear in UCAS.
Applicants interested in MBChB Medicine and Surgery, or the Medicine and Surgery with a Gateway Year course, should review the admissions information on the Medical School website .
All other subjects are included.
We offer a number of degree courses with a Foundation Year .
Eligible applicants on these courses will be made the standard offer, without lowered grades.
However, we are committed to taking a holistic approach to applications for these programmes, and to being flexible in considering entry qualifications.
Although we do not make lower offers for these degree courses, applicants who meet the eligibility criteria will still be included more broadly in the Contextual Offer Scheme, and will qualify for other relevant benefits, such as the Lancaster Opportunity Scholarship.
At the moment contextual offers are only considered for applicants applying to study at undergraduate level.
The Lancaster Opportunity Scholarship can be combined with the Lancaster Scholarship and the Lancaster Bursary, if you meet the required criteria.
For example, someone who qualifies for the Contextual Offer Scheme, and who meets the requirements of the Lancaster Scholarship, and the Lancaster Bursary could receive up to £4,000 in the first year.
We have a range of widening participation programmes to support students from underrepresented backgrounds to access higher education, including our Lancaster Access Programme .
We also recognise Realising Opportunities , a national access programme.
For more information about our widening participation programmes, please contact outreach@lancaster.ac.uk .
The Contextual Offer Scheme can be combined with the Lancaster Access Programme or Realising Opportunities.
Upon successful completion of the Lancaster Access Programme or Realising Opportunities, you will receive an alternative lower offer, typically up to three A level grades (or equivalent) below our published entry grades.
If you are part of the Lancaster Access Programme or Realising Opportunities, and you also qualify for the Contextual Offer Scheme, you will receive whichever offer is to your best advantage.
Students on the Lancaster Access Programme or Realising Opportunities programme are also eligible for the Lancaster Opportunity Scholarship.
At Lancaster, we have a range of support to ensure you are supported through every stage of your journey.

We review all applicants' qualification history following an application.
Applicants who do not meet the minimum requirements are encouraged to contact us at medicine@lancaster.ac.uk, detailing what qualifications they have achieved and when for further guidance.
Any AS or A level qualifications held should usually be at a minimum of grade C at first attempt.
Applicants offering an Access-type qualification to compensate for having studied the wrong subjects at A level are usually expected to offer three A levels and have achieved at least BBB at the first attempt.
Access courses are not appropriate for school-leavers to gain entry to Medicine and we will not accept in lieu of resitting A levels, or other equivalent qualifications.
We do not consider applications from those with an Access qualification if they have already re-taken AS or A level examinations and failed to meet the entry requirements at the second attempt.
GCSE:
Depending on individual circumstances, applicants may be required to demonstrate a score of at least 13 points from eight GCSEs, where A*/A or 7-9 = 2 points; B or 6 = 1 point

Alongside academic qualifications, we review domicile, English language proficiency, and any contextual information provided to ensure applications are reviewed fully and fairly.
We receive information about nationality and residential status through UCAS.
To support this, applicants are recommended to complete our Initial Applicant Survey, which is sent automatically following an application.
Applicants may be required to provide additional information if contacted by email.
If incorrect or incomplete information leads to an error in processing an application, then we reserve the right to amend our decision.
Fee status is determined by our Undergraduate Admissions team as a separate process, and so applicants may be required to provide further information at a later stage in the cycle.
All applicants who are applying from outside the UK or who have lived in the UK for less than 5 years at the point of application must demonstrate proficiency in English through one of the following recognised English Language qualifications:
Please see below for a list of exceptions:
This is in addition to our academic entry requirements.
We do expect all applicants, including those from overseas, to have studied English as part of their secondary education.
In our experience, however, GCSE/IGCSE English Language or English studied at A level/IB does not guarantee that applicants have appropriate ability in English.
Additional notes:
As part of our commitment to widening access to medicine, we take a holistic approach to reviewing applications and aim to understand as much as possible about our applicants, their circumstances, and their potential.
You will be invited to declare this information in your UCAS application, Initial Applicant Survey (IAS) and Supplementary Information Form (SIF).
You may need to provide evidence to support your case including evidence from your school, college, local authority, parent or guardian.
Contextual information will be taken into account at two stages of the admissions process:
Stage 2: shortlisting for interview based on UCAT scores.
Borderline candidates who meet WP criteria may be invited to interview using a lower overall score threshold.
Stage 3: candidates who are successful at interview may be considered for a contextually lowered offer of ABB.
If you do not meet one of the above criteria, then you must meet two or more of the criteria below:
Although you are required to submit a personal statement with your UCAS application, this will not be scored at any stage of our admissions process.
Instead, we use our interview to understand more about you, your background, and experiences and how these have influenced your decision to apply to medicine.
Your personal statement is an opportunity to prepare for the types of questions you will be asked at the interview.
It should reflect who you are and demonstrate what you have done to explore medicine as a career, what you have learned about being a doctor, your suitability for the profession, and your commitment to helping others.
Your personal statement is arranged into three sections, each centred around a question.
We do not require you to include specific information in a section, but some medical schools may do, so please check their websites before you structure your answers.
Before you write your personal statement and submit your application to study medicine, it is important to have undertaken some relevant work, voluntary or caring experience to help you understand what a career in medicine is like.
There is no set number of hours you need to complete, nor a defined list of experiences you need to have gained to be eligible to apply to us; a full range of experiences can help you to develop your knowledge, understanding and skills.
For more guidance on work experience and personal statements for Medicine, please take a look at the Studying Healthcare webpages.
UCAS also provides excellent general guidance on their website.
The second stage of the application process requires you to sit the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT).
Registration for the UCAT is separate from the UCAS application process.
The test must be taken in the summer before application.
Registration typically opens in May with bookings open from June.
The testing window runs from July to September.
Those wishing to take the test must register for an account in order to access bookings.
The cost of taking the UCAT is £70 in the UK and £115 for those living in other countries.
Applicants may be eligible for the UCAT Bursary and Access Arrangements, which must be applied for and arranged prior to booking a test.
You can find more information on the UCAT website .
Applicants who meet our academic requirements will be ranked according to their overall UCAT score.
Invitations to interview will be made based upon this ranking.
Please note that we will not consider applicants with an SJT score in band 4.
We will consider contextual information when reviewing UCAT scores.
Applicants should ensure that they complete the Initial Applicant Survey to provide us with this information.
The UCAT consists of four separately timed subtests in multiple-choice format:
UCAT has produced a number of resources aimed at helping you to prepare for the test, including tutorials for the different subtests as well as question banks to practice and familiarise yourself with the test.
UCAT recommends that candidates should "use the free official preparation materials to support their test preparation".
All of the resources on the UCAT webpages are free to access.
Stage three of the application process is the interview stage.
Applicants who meet our requirements and score competitively on their UCAT will be invited to interview, held in January and February.
Applicants will complete a number of different 'stations' which assess some of the skills, values and attributes required to study and practise medicine successfully.
Each station is assessed by a trained interviewer, including university staff, NHS clinicians, GPs, patient and public representatives, and medical students.
Applicants will be ranked based on their overall MMI score, which is calculated by combining individual station scores.
Offers will be made to the highest scoring applicants.
No offers are made without attending an interview.
Finally, you will be assessed on your fitness to practice.
The professional body that governs medical practice in the UK, the General Medical Council (GMC), has specific requirements to protect staff and patient safety.
In accordance with these requirements, all medical students must have the ability to function as a fully competent doctor and fulfil the rigorous demands of professional fitness to practise.
We take probity seriously throughout the admissions process.
Your UCAS application must be completed fully, accurately and honestly and without omissions.
Lancaster Medical School reserves the right to reject any applicant who is found to have been dishonest at any stage of their application
This information is collected in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.
For unsuccessful applicants, data related to any declared criminal convictions will be deleted and removed from our admissions system by the end of the relevant admissions period
A level (or equivalent) resits
A*AA must be achieved within three years of study, and applicants must reflect on their circumstances in their UCAS personal statement
We will consider applications from those who have taken longer than two years to achieve the required A level (or equivalent) grades — including applicants who have:
For applicants applying during their resit year:
GCSE (or equivalent) resits
We do not accept GCSE resits unless exceptional circumstances are clearly evidenced at the time of application.
For further guidance, please contact the Admissions Team.
Reapplications
We do not accept reapplications from candidates who were unsuccessful after interview in a previous cycle.
However, if you were rejected before interview, you may reapply if you can demonstrate additional work experience and self-reflection.

New sentences found on https://lancaster.ac.uk/study/important-information/under-18s-policy:
This page offers information for prospective, new and existing students who are under the age of 18.
The University treats all its students, regardless of age on entry, as independent, mature individuals.
However, under 18s living in England are considered by law to be children, which means the University has additional responsibilities towards students it admits who are under the age of 18 prior to the start of their course until the date at which they turn 18, even if this period is brief (once the student reaches the age of 18 this policy will no longer apply.
At this point the student will become liable and responsible with regard to all matters).
Applicants who are under 18 should be aware that they are applying to study in an adult environment and there may be a small number of limitations for them at the University while they are under 18.
Parent: lawful mother or father of a person (can include an adoptive parent)
Guardian: a person who is legally responsible for the care of someone who is unable to legally manage their own affairs, especially a child or young person under 18.
UK Guardian: a nominated guardian based in the UK who is prepared to take on the role of guardian for a student aged under 18.
The University is not able to take on the usual rights, responsibilities and authority which parents or guardians have in relation to a child, and it will not act in loco parentis (assuming parental responsibility) in relation to students who are under the age of 18.
If you are going to be under the age of 18 when you start your studies, and on a full-time course, you will be required to provide parental consent and to prove that you have guardianship in the UK.
Once you have confirmed that you will be studying at Lancaster University you and your parent(s)/guardian(s) must complete the consent forms below and confirm that you have the required level of maturity to study in an adult environment.
Both forms will need to be completed before you can enrol at the University.
The policy covering the University’s obligations is outlined below.
This policy should be read in conjunction with the Lancaster University's Safeguarding policies .
No applicant under the age of 18 will be eligible to be registered by the University until the Consent Forms have been submitted and processed.
People under the age of 18 are classified as children under UK law.
This means that their parents or legal guardians must make decisions on their behalf and hold legal responsibility for their protection and safety while their child is in the UK.
The University must therefore be able to contact a UK-based parent or guardian who can act on a student’s behalf while they are aged under 18.
To demonstrate guardianship in the UK you must have a parent who resides in the UK.
If your parent does not reside in the UK they must appoint a UK Guardian who will be the liaison point between the University and the parents if an emergency situation arises or there are serious concerns for the health or wellbeing of the person under 18.
The nominated UK Guardian must:
If you do not know anybody who can act as a UK Guardian, the service can be hired from a Guardianship Agency.
Lancaster University recommends Study Links as their preferred partner for Guardianship services.
They provide a range of guardianship roles and can make arrangements for travel etc.
where this is requested by the parents/legal guardians.
There are other guardianship agencies available.
If you wish to find your own agency you should look on the AEGIS website which provides a list.
Please ensure that the agency you agree to work with has experience of supervising University students as many agencies are aimed at children staying at boarding schools which is very different.
You must provide proof of your contract with the Guardianship Agency by emailing a copy of the contract to the email below.
The University will contact named UK guardians to confirm they have agreed to act as guardian to the applicant.
Your consent form will not be approved, and you will not be able to register, until your nominated UK guardian has confirmed that they are happy to act as guardian on your behalf.
Your parent, not your UK guardian, will remain as your legal guardian until you are 18.
For international applicants needing a visa to study in the UK, the University must comply with regulations set by the UK Visas and Immigration service of the UK’s Home Office.
As such, parents or guardians must ensure suitable care arrangements are in place for a child under the age of 18 who will study in the UK and be sponsored by the University under its Student license.
The consent forms must be returned to the University prior to the issuing of a Certificate of Acceptance of Study (CAS).
The following guidance seeks to ensure that the respective responsibilities of the University and parent or guardian in relation to the applicant are clear.
By submitting the University Consent Forms, it is deemed by the University that the student and the student’s parent(s) or guardian(s) have given their consent to the following:
As a student at Lancaster University who is under the age of 18 you will be expected to:
As a UK-based parent or UK Guardian you will be expected to:
As a student who is under the age of 18 cannot enter into our legal contracts, the University requires a student’s parents/guardians to honour all obligations under any contracts that the student enters into with the University prior to his or her eighteenth birthday (e.g.
payment of tuition and accommodation fees due to the University).
Parents and guardians should recognise that residential accommodation offered by the University is generally intended for the use of adults.
As part of the admission process, the relevant departmental Admissions Tutor will be consulted to ensure that they and the Head of Department are satisfied that the content of any academic programme would be appropriate for students under the age of 18.
This includes field trips and placements, where these activities would occur at a time when the student would be under 18 years old.
For some programmes it is a requirement of the relevant professional body that students are aged 18 or above when they enrol.
Parents and guardians should be aware that teaching staff will not routinely be DBS checked.
Courses may involve compulsory or optional field trips, excursions or other periods of study away from the University campus.
The University is not able to take any additional responsibility for a student who is under the age of 18 in relation to such activities.
Unless indicated otherwise, by submitting the consent forms the parent or guardian gives consent for the student to take part in these activities on that basis.
Risk assessments are carried out before all field trips and provision is made for inclusion of under 18s where possible.
Participation in some activities may be limited.
It is illegal for alcohol and other restricted goods or services to be sold to, or bought by, students who are under the age of 18.
Under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2003, it is a criminal offence for any person in a position of trust (which includes members of University staff) to engage in sexual activity with someone who is under 18 years old.
The University’s policy is that it deals with students and not with parents or guardians.
This approach will apply equally to students who are under the age of 18.
The University will therefore correspond with students, and not with parents or guardians, unless the University receives express written permission from the student or there is a medical, criminal or similar emergency.
The University offers email and unregulated internet services for all its students.
These services are provided on an unsupervised basis.
Students are expected to act in an adult and responsible manner when using these facilities and are required to abide by the University’s Computer User Agreement .
Although those under 18 are regarded as children under the law, they still have the right under the Data Protection Act for information about them not to be disclosed without their consent.
This means that the University is not able to give information to parents regarding the student's progress, results or most other personal circumstance.
However, if the student fails to pay any sums agreed on contract (see Contracts above) then it may be necessary to disclose this to any guarantor and possibly to a debt collection agency.
The relevant academic department, professional services and college personnel will be notified, prior to registration, of any student who will be under the age of 18 on entry to the University.
Teaching and other staff will not routinely be made aware of a student’s age.
A departmental risk assessment will be undertaken to ensure that appropriate safeguarding is in place for the individual student on their course.
As a student at Lancaster University you will belong to one of our nine colleges.
There are staff on duty around the clock, ready to help, whether it's a friendly word of advice, or something more pressing.

However, please be aware that some of the events and activities are age-restricted, and students need to prove that they are 18+ to attend.
This particularly relates to club nights and events such as 18+ films.
Students who turn 18 within the period of residence are eligible for our accommodation, students younger than this are not eligible.
There are welfare, safeguarding, and health & safety implications for having younger students in our accommodation, therefore this policy helps to minimise and manage risk to all students in the accommodation.
Further to this, there are legal implications regarding the way in which our rooms are contracted to students which are not appropriate for students under 17.
For students who are under 18 at the point of entry, we are unable to issue your CAS until we have confirmation of your UK guardian details and have heard back from them.
UK Guardians will be contacted from the email address: under18@lancaster.ac.uk , we encourage students to help this process by asking them to remind guardians to look out for this email address in their inbox or junk file.
After the 31 August 2023, we cannot guarantee that a student’s CAS will be confirmed in time for the start of term if we have not heard back from their UK Guardian.
If you have any queries about any of the information in this area, please email under18@lancaster.ac.uk and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

It all started with great friendships and a wonderful surf trip.
Four lifelong friends (our co-founders) travelled along the Peruvian coast in search of waves.
One of the locations they went to was the off-the-beaten-track town of Lobitos.
Whilst there, they caught some of the best waves of their lives, met some of the kindest people imaginable and were exposed to breath-taking natural beauty and wildlife.
Seeing the environmental and social constraints the town was enduring, contrasting with the natural beauty of the locality, made them realise that if nothing was done Lobitos' essence would not be a lasting one.

The course discusses the concept of lexicogrammar, a notion that allow us to see language holistically with the attention to patterns, which do not fit in older grammar book and dictionary descriptions.
Special attention is paid to spoken language and the ‘grammar of conversation’.
In this way, the course has a dual focus: 1) It provides linguistic knowledge and relevant terminology about the English language, guiding you through grammatical, lexical and lexico-grammatical patterns observed in large general corpora.
2) It teaches transferable skills of language description of a variety of lexico-grammatical phenomena based on corpus evidence.

Collectively, the nine colleges that make up Lancaster University are a distinctive feature of the student experience, regardless of whether you choose to live on or off the main campus.
Our colleges offer each student much more than simply a room to live in – we are communities of people that provide a ‘home-from-home’ where every student is able to feel comfortable, safe and respected regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances.
As such, the colleges provide the platforms that enable Lancaster students to get the most out of their university experience, from the moment they arrive to when they graduate and move on to pursue fulfilling careers and responsible lives.
All of the colleges reflect the basic principles and values of Lancaster University – they are all living examples of diverse groups of people who are ambitious, collaborative, inquisitive, progressive and supportive.
Nevertheless, each college has its own culture or ‘feel’.
At Lonsdale, our priorities include:
If you have any questions, or would like to arrange a visit to see what Lonsdale has to offer, please get in touch at any time.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairelawrenson/
My previous experience as an Information Officer and in administration have been invaluable in helping me manage a project effectively.
My role is very people based and I've got years of involvement working and helping people from a wide variety of backgrounds.
Get a mentor (and in your lifetime get several!) How wonderful it is to see students grow and flourish when they do.
My role is to connect top graduate employers with students at Lancaster University.
Through regular engagement and conversations, I encourage employers to take part in our careers fairs, deliver employer presentations and skills workshops or get involved in the curriculum.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuala-lewis/
I previously worked in local government and supported businesses to thrive and recruit staff.
My direct experience of working with businesses, meant I could relate to employers and develop strong relationships to encourage them to engage with Lancaster to recruit their future talent.
Always be open to learning new things and take advantage of opportunities when they arise.
I recently had the opportunity to learn to be a careers advisor.
Although this wasn't in my 'career plan', I took the opportunity and I have discovered something new that I really enjoy.
My role as a Senior Recruitment Intern focuses on helping current Lancaster University students develop employment skills through a variety of work opportunities.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/charity-onaiwu-agogbe-876a66188/
Working at McDonald's enabled me to develop people's skills, which I can regularly put into practice when conducting right-to-work checks for candidates, answering both candidates' & hiring managers' queries, and covering ERS desk
Always have a plan, because not having a plan is planning to fail
My job role consists of many communicative aspects, holding responsibility as an ERS member to ensure right to work checks are fulfilled both digitally and in person, keeping the website up to date with job roles, responding to & creating social media content, answering email inquiries etc.
http://linkedin.com/in/olivia-bilgin-a738051a8
This position was offered to me after I completed a micro internship as social media intern with GROW Your Future.
This introduced me to the team, the environment and I was surrounded by other interns which gave me insight on what was to come for me.
I also had hotel experience with customer service and emails.
Do not stress about set work experience when applying for a role, employers look for qualities of you and how you carry yourself, and you can always reflect on experience from elsewhere and utilise what you have, rather than what you don’t have.
I specialise in recruiting Students into part-time roles across Lancaster University
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesfrance-93/
In my previous role I worked for a big commercial recruitment agency in the Senior Finance sector, working with qualified accountants all the way to financial directors.
This translates perfectly into my current role - making the recruitment process as simple as possible.
Don't be afraid to fail.
Keep going and you will get where you need to be eventually, resilience is key.
My role involves ensuring that the Employment & Recruitment Service operates smoothly, including publishing vacancy adverts and conducting Right To Work checks for new employees.
While working in customer-facing roles before joining the ERS, I developed communication skills that I have been able to apply to numerous aspects of my current role, such as responding to queries from hiring managers, candidates, and employees.
You don’t have to know right now what you want to do in the future, do something you enjoy and doors will open.
I foster strong connections with hiring managers across the university and local businesses.
This collaboration helps the ERS provide exceptional opportunities for students, enabling them to gain valuable work experience and develop essential skills for their future careers.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-molyneux-8a628091/
I have experience as a multisite store manager in the UK supermarket sector and in EU e-commerce, managing teams across Europe.

My background includes roles focused on enriching the student experience, as well as building partnerships with external organisations to create valuable employability opportunities for students.
Rejections can be tough, but don't let them define your journey.
Every "no" is just a step closer to the right "yes".
The right role will come along when the time is right.
Stay patient, trust the process and keep believing in yourself - you are on the right path.
As the Careers Coach for Arts & Social Sciences, I'm here to support students with their career needs.

With many years in university employability roles, I've seen how valuable experiential learning, self-reflection and personal development can be.
Your time here is a journey, and it is my role to help you and provide opportunities to grow, explore, and develop.
The most game-changing career advice I've received is to view networking as building genuine relationships, not just a professional necessity.
By connecting authentically with others, opportunities and growth often naturally follow.
I support students in one to one appointments and deliver careers education within individual departments across FASS.
I meet with academics from each subject area to discuss and negotiate the best support for each group of students.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-bromley-04b7a1158/
I worked as a secondary teacher so teaching, communication & working across departments have been useful when working with teams & delivering careers sessions.
I practiced as a nutritional therapist so working one to one & imparting information has helped me retain knowledge and explain processes.
Avoid making decisions based on fear; take time to consider what is best for you.
I offer one-to-one appointments supporting with thinking about options, job searching and application making.
I run specialist coaching programmes on speculative applications, gap years, interview confidence, resilience, managing transitions and a general coaching programme led by what you need.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndseyegerton/
I’ve held many volunteering roles outside Careers so have seen first hand how skills from one role helps you be able to do another.
I use this background to help students understand how transferrable their skills, experiences and degree specific knowledge are to be successful with their next steps.
At work the days that matter most are MAD days - not crazy days, not busy days - but the Make A Difference Days where you can see the impact of what you do and you know you're part of something great.
If your job is full of MAD days, you'll have enormous job satisfaction, and nothing is worth more.

It is likely that your career will be more like a winding road than a straight line and that is ok!
I provide teaching sessions, 1:1 careers support, and career management tasks for Medical students undertaking the 5 year MBChB Medicine and Surgery programme.
I support students in their career thinking at all stages of their medical school journey, as they work towards becoming medical doctors.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenwaite22/
As a LUMS graduate my research within both my Master's and PhD introduced me to the fascinating world of medical careers.
My PhD thesis explored a range of career stories within an NHS Trust.
Prior to this, I had a varied career within sales & national account management.
I am also a qualified coach.
'Do what makes you happy!' and, 'follow your own path'.
It sounds cheesy, but you spend too long at work to be doing something that you don't enjoy.
And don't just follow the crowd, you can create your own path and don't need to compare yourself with others.
I work with students who have a goal to secure a 10-12 month work placement.
Face to face and online meetings take place on an ongoing basis & resources like vacancy bulletins are on offer plus workshops and webinars.
The role also involves offering support to students whilst on placement.
Nicky Allan, LinkedIn
I think that previous roles held in offering careers guidance to students, and also work done connecting with employers does link to being a Placement Officer.
Why not step in and taste a role or sector in any way you can to experience it!
You could talk to an employer at the end of a guest lecture; message an employee via Linked In; arrange to do a 1 day work shadow...
the list goes on...

Not from a careers background but I have worked in many businesses, industries and sectors and so have a good insight to what a business large medium or small are looking for though student support and understand how both student and company can gain from the experience.
Your career path will never be straight forward and easy but it will take you to places that you had not considered if you are receptive and open to new opportunities.

I first worked in marketing roles for charities which helped to develop my communication skills.
I then moved to work in student support roles in Higher Education which has given me a good understanding of the challenges students face at all stages of their university journey.
No-one expects you to know everything straight away when you start a new role.
Ask questions and show that you are keen to learn.
Be kind to yourself and accept it will take time to settle-in and get to know new people.
This has helped me to feel happier about taking new steps in my working life.
Supporting students with various types of career related appointments, through workshop delivery and specific projects, to enhance employability skills.
Also, promoting the Career service, highlighting its accessibility and the benefits of utilising this provision.
My experience from teaching means I am aware that one size does not fit all, and therefore aim to adapt my practice to ensure an inclusive environment.
Having recruited staff and students in previous roles, I understand how making a positive impact from the outset is a priority.
Don’t give up!
If one path doesn’t lead to where you want to go, then look for another way.
Keep developing your skills throughout the journey, and enjoy it!

I’ve worked on personal development programs to help students enhance employability through work, volunteering, and career skills.
I’ve also partnered with employers to host careers events for high school students.
These experiences give me insight into students’ challenges and employer expectations.
The best advice I received was from Richard Branson, who encourages people to take on roles they may not fully know and learn on the job.
This pushes you out of your comfort zone, revealing new things about yourself.
Transferable skills can help you succeed in these challenges.
I'm the first point of contact for queries from students, graduates, staff and any others that wish to get in touch with the Careers service here at the university.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/atchara-langley
Having previously worked in hospitality and recruitment, I've found that you can learn a lot by asking questions and by listening.
Both skills are vital in my role to ensure that I can provide correct information or signpost on to the relevant person or department.
You don't have to have it all figured out and rush to attain that "perfect" job.
It's ok to pivot and do other things to figure out what you'd ideally like to do.
You'll probably pick up some other skills along the way!

No career is ever a straight line, but take that professional encouragement when it is offered, it can be life changing professionally and personally.
I coach and support graduates and postgraduate students with their careers, and develop and maintain some of the technical systems used by the wider Careers team.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-naylor/
My experience in commercial sales management and professional recruitment gives me practical experience of the techniques used in graduate recruitment, and how to stand out in competitive application processes.
Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

I support students by providing one-to-one careers appointments and delivering skills workshops.
I also manage the Lancaster Award, which is our extra-curricular employability award.

I joined Careers straight after graduating from Lancaster, but I do have experience working in FASS and LUMS, which gave me a better insight into our faculties.
I also completed my postgraduate careers qualification at Warwick, enabling me to apply a more theoretical approach to my advice.
'Look after number one' (i.e.
yourself!) You should always pursue a job or career that's right for you.
Alongside managing the Careers Student Engagement Team, I’m also responsible for the collection of graduate destination data.
We contact all students 15 months post-graduation to find out what they’re doing.

It's many years since I completed a Master's in Social Research but I still use what I learned back then in my current role, whether it's planning research projects, facilitating focus groups or analysing quantitative data.
My first line manager told me you won't regret the things you do.
You'll regret the things you don't do when you have the chance.
Whether that applies to your career or life in general, there's definitely a lot of truth in this.

Open Research champions the idea that all types of scholarly outputs (including data) should be shared as freely as possible and as early as possible in the research process across all disciplines, both within and beyond academia.
Open Research offers numerous potential benefits: providing medical and health researchers with robust data to improve health outcomes, enabling scholars to work at the intersection of digital technologies and the arts and humanities, and driving innovation for business and entrepreneurs by providing them with access to leading research findings.
Open Research increases transparency and accelerates discovery and innovation, enabling all members of an enquiring society to learn from and build upon scholarship and science – improving the health of our communities, advancing our understanding of the human condition, and empowering small to medium businesses and third sector organisations.
We all stand to benefit, and that is why open research is a key part of the research culture at Lancaster.

The University is committed to ensuring research metrics are utilised responsibly, having become a signatory of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in 2019.

By practicing Open Research our academic community may benefit from:
Whilst the University advocates for Open Research, we acknowledge that challenges remain, including concerns around intellectual property, data privacy, and the resources required to make outputs openly available.
We are committed to addressing these challenges by developing policies and best practices that balance openness with ethical, legal, and practical considerations, and that incentivise open behaviours.
The University acknowledges that engagement with Open Research will differ across disciplines and projects and may be determined by a variety of factors, such as but not exclusive to; commercial potential, industry partnerships, human participant data, and publisher requirements.

I have particularly enjoyed Open Days, where meeting and chatting to new people has really boosted my confidence, and working as part of a team with the other ambassadors has been so much fun!
I've also developed a lot of other skills by being involved in other projects, such as helping to develop and write content for the library newsletter, collecting feedback from current students on the Library's resources and communications, and collating e-books and audiobooks on Libby to contribute to the Library Student Ambassador Picks collection.
Overall, the experience has been really rewarding!"

For example, the Learning Development team can help with your essays which I find really useful as a law student.
I also really feel like getting involved with events such as ‘Welcome Week’ and open days has really helped me develop my own inter-personal communication and public speaking skills; I never would’ve imagined myself sitting on student panels and working public events but this role helped me to become a really confident version of myself."

They must have liked my responses because I was then invited to submit a proposal to Liverpool University Press.
When I was writing the proposal, I attended a helpful workshop in Liverpool facilitated by Alison Welsby, the Editorial Director of Liverpool University Press.
She set us on the right track and answered all our questions.
Alison made clear that once an early career researcher had been accepted onto the Trailblazers Scheme, she and her colleagues would always continue to work with us to get our book published, however long it took.
After my proposal was reviewed by two anonymous reviewers, there was plenty of encouraging and constructive feedback.
After writing my response to the reviews, the editorial board requested an extended proposal.
This was accepted and I attended another workshop with Alison, this time online, to help those on the scheme to understand our contract.
Now I just need to find time to write the book!
What do you consider to be the most significant benefit of participating in the scheme?
For me, the most significant benefit of participating in the scheme is having the opportunity to publish open access.
The primary audience for my book, provisionally titled, Teaching in online rooms: Stories from virtual communities is online distance educators.
This includes not only those in higher education, but also a wider audience of educators in other settings who are unlikely to access research about online teaching.
This can be because they lack the time to do so, lack access to academic libraries, or perhaps because they see research as ‘other’ and irrelevant to them, running parallel to their teaching practice or even undermining it.
Through this book and sharing the stories of online learning and teaching collected during my doctoral research and elsewhere, I hope to help readers connect with and learn from students' and educators' experiences.
What guidance would you offer to other early career researchers who may be hesitant about pursuing Open Access publishing?
Work that is published open access really does reach a much wider, more diverse audience, benefitting you as a researcher and promoting social justice in education at the same time.
There are costs involved of course but in a scheme like this, the publishing and marketing costs are all paid by the scheme and the costs to you are your time and effort.
You will receive the royalties on any printed copies of the book that are sold.
To those who are hesitant about starting the process, I would say take it a step at a time and ask for advice as you go along.
What does this proposal approval signify for your academic career, and what future opportunities might it open up for you?
For me, the offer of an open access book contract is an important stepping stone to writing my first monograph, which will hopefully be widely read.
It gives me a platform to share the experiences of learners and educators who took part in my doctoral research and contribute to shaping online pedagogy and practice.
It also provides opportunities for me to learn about the writing process and open access publishing that I can use for any future publications and share with colleagues and the doctoral researchers I support within Lancaster University.
Kathy’s experience as the first Trailblazers author highlights the exciting potential of open access publishing to widen the impact of research.
Early career researchers interested in taking this step can find out more about applying by visiting the Trailblazers website.

We are very proud to be a member of the Open Institutional Publishing Association (OIPA), which formally launched in Autumn 2023.
This group is a community of practice for publishing operations affiliated with institutions which are striving for open access, from small and medium-sized university presses to individuals based within university libraries working on scholarly journals.
The association offers a new infrastructure to support non-commercial open access publishing within the UK, creating a forum to share advice, information, resources, training and best practice.
The Library launched Lancaster University Open Journals in January 2025, a platform managed by the Library for hosting open access journals.
We have developed this service to make it possible and easy for colleagues managing Open Access journals to host their publications and manage their journal workflows on the platform for free.
The service removes the need for colleagues to pay expensive annual subscription fees (usually between £1200 to £1500) for hosting services and ensures their long-term preservation without the need to continuously find sources of funding.
The service uses Open Journal Systems (OJS) software, an open-source platform developed by the Public Knowledge Project.
The platform allows journal editors to manage the entire publishing workflow from submission to online publication on a single platform.
Articles and issues published on the platform can be indexed in global discovery services.
“ We are delighted to have become a member of the Open Institutional Publishing Association; our invitation to join recognises our growing role as open publishers.
We are convinced that it is by collaborating with other institutions that we will strengthen our long-standing commitment to Open Access and to developing an Open Research Culture .”- Andrew Barker, Director of Library Services

Writing a Will is one of the most important things you will ever do.
After taking care of family and friends, would you consider leaving a gift to Lancaster?
Legacies of all sizes from generous supporters have had a major impact on Lancaster University, providing a lasting heritage through academic fellowships, memorial scholarships, student prizes, equipment and support to the Library and our Public Art programme.
Particularly beneficial are legacies that can be used at the discretion of the University, as they can often be used to maximise current strategic opportunities that leverage in significant additional resources.
Your legacy could change the life of a student, or lead to break-through discoveries that address major global issues.
A PhD student in Palliative Care has been funded thanks to a legacy from alumnus, Richard Walters 1952-2010 (Pictured above.)
Richard died from cancer in 2010 aged, 57, leaving £17,000 to Lancaster University where he was a student of physics from 1971-1974.
His widow, Alison (pictured left with awardee Debbie Hayden), gave her own personal donation to top the amount up to £20,000.
The money has enabled the creation of The Richard Walters Bursary in Palliative Care, funding a five-year, part-time distance learning PhD studentship in Palliative Care at the International Observatory on End of Life Care.
The bursary awardee, Debbie Hayden, is currently a lecturer at Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services in Dublin where she is doing the PhD by distance learning:
"This bursary means the difference between doing the PhD and not doing it, but meeting Alison makes it more special.
I lost my mother recently so we both know how vital palliative care is." - Debbie Hayden
Alison Walters, Richard's widow, explains: "It has given Richard the opportunity to say thank you, as he would have wanted, to those wonderful people in palliative care who helped us then and have helped me since.
This bursary honours their work.
It has given a voice to a story to which I feel a responsibility, a personal tragedy with a universal message - medicine cannot cure all and high quality palliative care matters."

Raising funds and awareness of Lancaster University's research into Alzheimer's Disease
Raising funds for and awareness of dementia research in Lancaster University’s Division of Biomedical Sciences.
Dementia, the leading form of which is Alzheimer’s disease, is an absolutely devastating group of conditions.
For people living with these conditions and their families a dementia diagnosis is the start of an immense emotional and physical journey.
This is why organisations like Defying Dementia have been established in an effort to contribute, at a local level, to the development of drugs and identification of drug targets for the treatment of dementia.
We are a multi-faceted organisation consisting of our supporters and donors who fund the coal face researchers of the organisation, the Defying Dementia shop in Lancaster and the Defying Dementia Student Society
Prior to David Allsop’s passing, his research group at Lancaster University had been developing a way of treating Alzheimer’s.
The condition is caused by the accumulation of ‘clumps’ of poisonous protein fragments in the brain that kill nerve cells.
These clumps are formed mainly from two sticky proteins called ‘amyloid beta’ and ‘tau’.
David initially developed a drug that could stop/slow down the formation of amyloid beta clumps and was working on developing it further to stop the formation of tau clumps.
Essentially, the drugs work by sticking many copies of another protein fragment, similar to the ones in the poisonous clumps, to the surface of tiny fat droplets called liposomes.
The liposomes help get the protein fragments into the brain where the latter insert themselves into the toxic clumps and cause them to dissolve.
As a group of neurodegeneration scientists at Lancaster University, we wish to see David’s research legacy continued and, at the same time, develop it further to incorporate additional aspects of our own research with the overarching aim of developing a drug effective against Alzheimer’s.
Dr Ed Parkin, the Defying Dementia scientific lead (far left opposite), is looking at ways of utilising protective proteins in the brain that work to combat Alzheimer's.
Cheryl Hawkes (second from left) works on ways of improving communication between nerve cells in the brain and improving blood supply to the organ, both of which are important in the prevention of Alzheimer's.
Neil Dawson (second from right) worked closely with David Allsop and is developing ways of combining his drugs into a single treatment that simultaneously reduces both amyloid beta and tau clumps in the brain.
Finally, our newest recruit, Shefeeq Theparambil (far right) investigates the role played by house-keeping cells called astrocytes in Alzheimer's.
Collectively, we form a strong research team passionate about continuing the development of a drug that has the potential to slow down, or even stop the progression of this devastating disease.
With your help, our research will contribute to making this possible!
This video reveals why our Alzheimer’s drug must be brought to life.
With each passing moment, people across the world lose their memories, their independence, and their connection to loved ones because of this relentless disease.
We believe in the power of hope, science, and community to make a change.
Please explore below to learn more about the Defying Dementia campaign and the incredible work being done to turn the tide against Alzheimer’s.
See below the latest news regarding our dementia research activities in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University along with expert comment on the latest dementia stories making the news.
It is with great thanks to our supporters that we are proud to introduce you to our latest Defying Dementia-funded researcher, Darcie Lovell  (shown working with fly models of Alzheimer’s).
Darcie was a Defying Dementia Student Society-funded undergraduate summer intern working in our labs alongside Alice Wood (PhD student funded by Defying Dementia).
We found her to be extremely committed to her research and studies and hope that she will build a fantastic future research career in the fight against dementia.
So we were really happy when she accepted our offer of her undertaking a further research degree in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University.
She will be jointly supervised in her studies by all four lead Defying Dementia scientists and will start her research in October 2025 following the completion of her undergraduate degree.
No doubt you will meet her at one of our future lab open days!
It's always a pleasure to invite our supporters in to hear about our research and see how/where we conduct it in our labs.
As such the Defying Dementia team recently hosted an insightful lab tour and talk event at Lancaster University.
Chaired by Dr Ed Parkin, the event offered attendees a unique opportunity to explore the innovative dementia research being conducted at the University.
PhD researchers Alice Wood and Hannah Chadwick shared information about their research with guests, and Dr Cheryl Hawkes updated the group on plans for creating a Defying Dementia ‘Patient and Public Involvement’ group.
Joined by Dr Neil Dawson, guests were then taken on an insightful tour of the laboratories to see some of the research in action.
Defying Dementia leads Neil Dawson and Ed Parkin have recently teamed up with one of our Lancaster-based cancer researchers, Dr Andrew Fielding (shown here) to successfully obtain funding from Alzheimer's Research UK to undertake a pilot study on PROTACS as potential drugs to treat Alzheimer's.
PROTACS, rather like antibodies in our immune system, recognise specific proteins but, unlike antibodies, PROTACS target the proteins to which they bind to the degradation machinery of the cell (rather like a car dismantling plant).
We hope to design PROTACS to bind to a protein called PDE4 depletion of which is thought to be beneficial in the Alzheimer's-afflicted brain.
Congratulations to Dr Amelia Bryers, one of our previous DD-funded PhD students (pictured on the right here alongside another DD-funded PhD student Alice Wood) who recently successfully defended her PhD thesis which examined the role of a molecule called neurexin1alpha on the surface of nerve cells in the brain.
The molecule helps nerve cells to make contact with each other strengthening the transmission of impulses.
Amongst other things Amelia examined how levels of neurexin1alpha were controlled at the cell surface.
If we can develop a specific way of preventing the release of the molecule from the nerve cell surface then we might be able to enhance the strength of contacts between nerves to strengthen cognition in people living with dementia.
We congratulate Amelia and hope she will continue with a career in dementia.
Thank you all once more for supporting the research of our PhD students!
Defying dementia leads Shefeeq Theparambil and Ed Parkin, along with our colleague Nick Robinson have recently been awarded a Faculty of Health and Medicine funded PhD studentship to study the role of astrocytes (house keeper cells in the brain) in dementia.
This is great as it means it now costs Defying Dementia about £70k less to fund the work of this research student!
Shefeeq has also been successful in other respects, obtaining £5k of funding from Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK) for a one year project to investigate how astrocytes regulate acidity in the brain in Alzheimer's.
He has also received £162k from ARUK to investigate the role of a molecule called, adenosine 2b receptor, in regulating blood flow in the brain and how this might relate to Alzheimer's.
Congratulations Shefeeq and we look forward to hearing more about this research at future DD open days.
About Defying Dementia
Defying Dementia is a community-supported campaign aiming to change the world that we live in and make a real difference to people's lives by tackling the big threat that is presented by Alzheimer's disease.
There are currently no drugs available that cure Alzheimer’s, none that prevent it, and not even any drugs that are able to slow down its progression.
Defying Dementia was founded in 2015 by Dr Penny Foulds, in order to progress a promising Alzheimer's drug (developed by Professor David Allsop and his team) into human clinical trials.
We have been conducting important pre-clinical experiments on this treatment, thanks to the money that has been donated through the Defying Dementia campaign.
We hope that our drug will be able to progress into human clinical trials very soon, which will take place at Blackpool-based MAC Clinical Research.
The campaign has now expanded to include regular events for the community such as The Bay Dementia Hub, Freshers Young Onset Cafes, sponsored walks, lectures and the Defying Dementia Fundraising and Community Shop at 50 Church St, Lancaster.
With an ageing population, more families are going to face the heartbreak caused by this disease that destroys memory, personality and movement, unless we can tackle it now.
The Defying Dementia Team
Meet our Defying Dementia team at Lancaster University who are fundraising for, and carrying out this important research into neurodegenerative diseases.
Dr Edward Parkin is a senior lecturer at Lancaster and his research centres around the breakdown of a protein in the body called ‘amyloid precursor protein (APP)’.
Toxic fragments clipped out of APP by molecular scissors are called amyloid-beta-peptides and are one of the sticky protein fragments that can clump together and become toxic to nerve cells in the brain in Alzheimer’s.
Fortunately, there are alternative ways that APP can be cleaved by different molecular scissors, some of which preclude toxic fragment formation and, instead, lead to the formation of alternative protective soluble APP (sAPP) fragments in the brain.
Edward’s research looks into these beneficial pathways and attempts to develop gene therapy methods to enhance their function in the brain as a way of treating Alzheimer’s.
Dr Neil Dawson a senior lecturer at Lancaster, investigates how genetic and environmental risk factors for dementia impact on the brain, behaviour and cognition.
He also studies how brain imaging can give us a greater insight into brain diseases, and how this can be used in developing new drugs for the disorder.
His recent research has focused on the therapeutic potential of protein aggregation inhibitors, synaptic protein processing inhibitors and the enzyme phosphodiesterase-4 in dementia.
Dr Cheryl Hawes, a senior lecturer at Lancaster, conducts research designed to understand the causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In particular, she focuses on the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) a condition in which the toxic amyloid-beta-peptides associated with Alzheimer’s accumulate in the walls of blood vessels in the brain.
She is interested in how risk factors for Alzheimer’s such as ageing and obesity, affect the structure of the blood vessels and their ability to remove amyloid-beta-peptides from the brain.
Cheryl is also interested in how the early life environment, including maternal and paternal obesity, impacts on the health and function of the offspring brain and if the early life environment predisposes individuals towards developing age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s.
Dr Shefeeq Theparambil, a lecturer at Lancaster, investigates the mechanisms regulating brain energy production and their links to the flow of ions across cell membranes and related communication pathways between cells.
His research focuses on the role of glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which make up around 50% of all cells in the brain (the rest being nerve cells) their roles being to support and protect the nerve cells.
Recently, he started exploring how disruptions in these glial functions affect nerve cell activity in dementia.
Additionally, he examines how disturbances in brain acidity may affect nerve cell survival in conditions such as stroke and dementia.
The Defying Dementia funding model centres around educating our future dementia researchers.
These individuals are the 'coal face' workers who conduct the research funded by the organisation:
Amelia Bryers
Amelia Bryers is studying for a PhD at Lancaster University funded by Defying Dementia and investigates how a molecule called neurexin1 binds nerve cells together allowing them to communicate.
She is examining how the molecule is broken down into fragments; controlling this breakdown might improve communication between nerve cells in the brain.
Alice Wood
Alice Wood is undertaking a PhD funded by Defying Demetia.
She is currently investigating novel fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that may protect against Alzheimer’s She has already shown in cell cultures that certain fragments promote cell proliferation whilst others are toxic.
She is now progressing this research into fly models of Alzheimer’s
Darcy Lovell
Darcy Lovell recently undertook a summer undergraduate internship in our laboratories funded by the Defying Dementia Student Society.
She helped Alice Wood with her fly models of Alzheimer’s disease and is hoping to undertake a Defying Dementia funded research degree in the future.
Lauren Owens
Lauren Owens recently successfully obtained her PhD, undertaking a Defying Dementia funded project investigating the role of a molecule called soluble APPalpha in Alzheimer's.
Conventional thinking is that a small toxic protein called amyloid beta causes nerve cell death in the disease.
However, the increased production of amyloid beta comes at the cost of soluble APPalpha production.
The latter molecule has lots of benefits for nerve cells (including stimulating their growth and protecting them, against toxic events) and Lauren’s work suggests that it might be the depletion of soluble APPalpha, as much as the accumulation of amyloid beta, that causes Alzheimer’s

The Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship provides a safe place at Lancaster for scholars who face persecution and barriers to research freely in their own countries.
Academic freedom was a founding principle of the University and we believe that Lancaster can build on this ethic by providing a safe environment for academics unable to work due to persecution or conflict in their own countries.
Lancaster University provides a full fee waiver and offers in-kind and direct financial assistance to each Fellow and their accompanying family dependents.
The Fellowship was created in response to the rapid increase in numbers of academics needing support.
We want to be able to offer facilities for this purpose at Lancaster.
Working alongside the Council for At-Risk Academics (Cara), the Sanctuary Fellowship will enable an academic or student at risk to spend time in safety in the UK to further their work.
If sufficient funding can be raised, this would include the families of the academics we are supporting.
It costs up to £40,000 to support an academic for one year - depending on whether they arrive alone or with their family.
This money pays for their basic living expenses.
The Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship has already been able to support three academics seeking sanctuary and this year, we hope to fund our fourth Fellow.
To be able to do this, we need your help.
Any donation that you make will help Lancaster to become a place of Sanctuary for those fleeing persecution.
Alli is our third Fellow in the Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship.
Click the video to listen to his story and experience with the programme.
Our First Fellow's story
"It can happen in so many countries: an individual who has never received even a traffic ticket can start being discriminated against overnight without doing anything wrong.
Their world can be turned upside down.
We do not expect such things, even in our wildest nightmares, to happen to us, but this is what happened to me.
And although eventually, we know that society will recover and human rights will one day be respected again, for an individual in the academy, this period could be a very long time.
For me, the support of Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship came at a very critical time in my life.
I was effectively blocked from social life in my country and in a very unpleasant situation, not knowing what might happen tomorrow.
At that critical time, Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship gave me a port and an opportunity to continue with research and contribute to wider society with my experience and my work in science.
My labs and the entire university were confiscated, and I was denied access to university research facilities, even to the libraries.
Currently, however, with the support of Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship, I am working with a research group in the UK that has the potential to contribute substantially to society at both a scientific and technical level, an opportunity I was denied in my home country.
For a scientist, even a short six months of being kept from research activities under discriminatory policies can be very destructive.
The opportunity by Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship played a crucial role for me, at a personal level, for my scientific research and contribution to academia and society.
It is hard to overestimate what Lancaster Sanctuary Fellowship makes possible; it contributes to the existence of the individual and their right to life, to the creativity of the individual, which otherwise would have been terminated, to the research he/she participates in, and to the future of freedom of speech and expression in the entire world, which in return, is the main guarantee of our existence as individuals in these modern times.
We would definitely be living in a much better world if we had more organizations like CARA, ideally in every democracy in the world, so that society can better protect individuals with more powerful and responsive financial support.
It is a bet that is meant to win for sure.
As a response, being productive in my work is a pleasure.
Thank you."
Cara was featured on Channel 4 news, where esteemed British Sculptor and long-term supporter of Cara, Antony Gormley, discussed its importance with Jon Snow.
Gormley highlights the key role academics worldwide play in the contemporary environment and how Cara allows them to carry out the vital work they do.

Interestingly, my final dissertation on the MA Marketing was for British Telecom in Liverpool, which was instrumental in getting my initial interview with BT in London.
As telecoms, digital, and mobile industries flourished throughout the 1990’s I entered the world of Joint Ventures, Mergers, and Acquisitions.
Initially this was across Europe for British Telecom, as I headed up the Marketing development for a number of newly established second operators.
I later joined IBM in the UK, but predominantly ended up working extensively in South Africa and Australia, as well as the US, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific..
I moved to Canada in 2009 and joined PricewaterhouseCoopers as VP of Consulting & Deals.
My focus was on the digital and technology space, and especially in the Marketing and Media industries.
Since 2015 I have been Managing Principal of North America for Eaton Square, a privately held global Corporate Finance and M&A firm.
I have also been leading the global Corporate Development of the organization as we grow our capabilities across the World, as well as managing Board positions, Investments, and Management Consulting to a range of businesses.
Most of my professional life has been spent at the intersection of business processes and computer technologies.
Whether co-founding venture-backed startups or consulting to global corporations, the methodology developed by Peter Checkland and Brian Wilson in the Department of Systems has continuously contributed to my ability to effect purposeful change.
Although some take a university education for granted, I’ve always recognised it as an astonishing privilege and I was fortunate enough to have undertaken my tertiary education at a time when fees were not imposed.
Had this not been the case, my entire adult life would have been profoundly different and far more constrained, as I’d never have been able to find the funds necessary to embark on a degree course of any kind.
When I arrived in Silicon Valley in 1991, on many occasions I received generous time, advice, and support from seasoned entrepreneurs; support that enabled me to build my own all-important network that ultimately enabled me to start five different venture-backed companies.
Whenever I asked, “what can I do to repay your help?” I’d hear the same answer: “you can’t do anything to help me because I’m already successful; what you can do is pay it forward by helping others when you’re successful and they need what you can provide.”
For the last thirty years I’ve done my best to “pay it forward” and contributing to Lancaster University is one modest way in which I, and all of us who have benefited from studying there can help those who come after us.
If enough of us give, even a small amount each month can ultimately build a mountain of support for those whose lives, like ours, will be changed forever if only they can be helped to experience what all of us have already benefitted from.
Alaa came to Lancaster University on a Chevening Scholarship and finished his full-time MBA in 2003.
As a beneficiary of a scholarship, he realised at an early stage of his career, how much the financial support can make a difference in someone’s future.
He’s now convinced that a philanthropic donation in education has a great impact that can relatively easily be measured and linked to personal, economic and social empowerment.
That explains why he was so thrilled to accept the chapter’s presidency position when it was offered to him and he pledged to provide immediate support.
Studying at Lancaster was pivotal in Alaa’s career, he enjoyed the world-class education and the cohort that represented more than 20 nationalities.
When he returned to Saudi Arabia, his newly acquired competencies helped him to progress in the banking and investment industry and then leadership and management consulting.
After completing 20 years of executive work, Alaa switched to a portfolio career and he is now a Board Director in numerous companies and advisory boards.
Alaa is considered an opinion leader in the GCC and recently his name was included in the LinkedIn “Top Voices of the Gulf” list for 2020.
His areas of focus are corporate governance, gender diversity in the board, women empowerment, wealth management and the promotion of tourism and foreign direct investment in his country.

I am honoured to be an Ambassador for the University, helping to support Lancaster’s goal of being a ‘go to’ university for research and teaching that transforms lives, communities, practices and thinking across the globe.
My own experience was indeed transformative as I graduated from Lancaster in 1990 and went on to build a successful career in IT, first as a software engineer and for the last 20 years as an executive leader.
It is a career that has taken me all over the world, working for several software vendors and enabled me to live across Europe and North America where I currently live in Vancouver in Canada with my wife and two boys.
I am currently the global head of software support at SAP, leading over 800 people across many different countries, helping our customers on their digital transformation journey’s in a fast-changing world.
As the first person in my family to ever go to university, my time at Lancaster helped set me on a continuous path of lifelong learning that enabled what I’ve since achieved and shaped me into who I am today.
Aside from what I learnt academically it was also the people that I met and the enduring friendships that I formed, that really helped encourage me to challenge myself to make a difference.
In particular it taught me the power of building long lasting diverse relationships with people from whom I could continually learn.
The collegiate campus-based system at Lancaster really creates the environment for you to mix with students across faculties, and with very different backgrounds to your own.
It is one of the things that attracted me to Lancaster and I have fond memories of representing Pendle College at football, pool and darts as well as attending the many famous College Balls!
I am still in touch with many of those friends and our shared experiences at Lancaster remain a source of great pleasure when we get together.
I appreciate this opportunity to show students how Lancaster provides the environment to challenge yourself to make a difference in the world and maximize your potential regardless of your background or financial means.
Lancaster is one of the best universities in the UK, offering a terrific collegiate environment and I am proud to be involved with the University and to be an Ambassador.

My career benefitted so much from my education at Lancaster - I was able to move from a local Singapore bank selling foreign exchange to becoming a managing director with UBS offering investment banking services.
My perspectives of the world widened beyond my imagination through my engagement with fellow students and lecturers at Lancaster.
On a personal front, I got to know a wonderful girl doing her MA in Literary Studies at Lancaster University during my time there.
She is now my wife.
We have been married for more than 17 years with two kids.
The education we received and the friendship we fostered at Lancaster have shaped both our lives.
This donation is a token to show our appreciation for the impact the University has on us.
We are forever grateful.
Now as the founder of the Institute of Life , I am devoting myself to education, teaching and writing with the mission of training professionals to be successful at work and in life.
I can be reached at www.linkedin.com/in/simeric .
Over 20 years have passed since I graduated from Lancaster University.
When I came to Lancaster, I brought my wife and two children, and my wife became pregnant during our time there.
We had a good time in Lancaster and have fond memories of our stay.
After I graduated, I continued to work in the asset management industry in Japan and Hong Kong.
I have worked for a Japanese company, a German company and international joint ventures as a senior analyst and Head of Research.
Currently, I am CEO of Nippon Life Global Investors Singapore, a joint venture between Japanese insurance group and British asset management company, and have lived in Singapore for 8 years.
I strongly believe that what I learned at Lancaster University helped my career a lot.
I really appreciate Lancaster University and now it is the time for me to contribute to the university.
After graduating from Lancaster University I qualified as an actuary and had an executive career in financial services which involved living and working across five continents.
I am now an independent non executive director on several boards, including Reinsurance Group of America, which is a NYSE listed Fortune 250 company with over $12bn in revenue.
I am tremendously grateful to Lancaster University; my degree provided a great foundation for my financial services career.
On graduating from Lancaster University, I joined our family business Sumaria Group, and have managed it for over 35 years and helped to transform a small trading company to a significant corporate group in the region.
Sumaria Group has diversified interest in East Africa, mainly manufacturing of plastic and beverage products, agro processing and real estate.
I am currently Chairman of the Board of Mayfair Insurance Tanzania, Board Member of M Oriental Bank in Kenya, Trustee of Indian School, Dar es Salaam and Trustee of Human Welfare Trust (HWT).
I have previously been an Independent Non-Executive Board Member of Standard Chartered Bank Tanzania Limited, Alliance Insurance Limited and Board Member of International School of Tanganyika, first alumni to become a Board Member.
I have been ranked in the top 15 most respected CEO’s in East Africa by PWC.
Many of us take education for granted.
My own experience while working with HWT showed a different perspective.
HWT was providing a couple of meals to the children on the street and education was a distant hope.
I jointly with HWT placed the street children in a house with food, education and medical treatment being taken care of.
This was my awakening call and since then have focused on supporting individuals who need support with their education requirements.
I have a lot of fond memories of my days at Lancaster and am in touch with many alumni.
I am delighted to take up a role as an Ambassador for the University and, in my own small way, to assist students achieve their dreams.
I am married to Rita and have a son and daughter-in-law.
I enjoy a good book, travelling around the world, smashing the ball against a wall and getting all my frustrations out, better known as squash and cycle around the neighbourhood in the name of exercise.
I graduated from Lancaster in 1980 and went on to qualify as a Chartered Accountant with Thomson McLintock, now part of KPMG.
I have worked for a number of financial institutions, including JPMorgan Asset Management where I spent nearly 20 years.
I am now Chief Executive of Miton Group plc, a listed fund management business.
I have been a member of the Council of the University since 2013, and chair of the Finance and General Purposes Committee for the past three years.
This recent involvement with the University has been hugely rewarding.
Lancaster is a superb teaching and research University and in no way compromises its commitment to excellence, with a real desire to be accessible to as wide a group of people as possible.
Lancaster was hugely influential in shaping my life and career.
I can see at first hand how the work and teaching at Lancaster makes a real difference to students and more widely: by delivering great teaching, by being a significant catalyst for economic activity in the North West and through excellence of the research undertaken by academics at Bailrigg.
Lancaster has in just over fifty years become one of the best universities in the UK.
I am proud to be involved with the University and to be an Ambassador.
I entered Lancaster University, Department of Marketing under Professor John Lawrence in 1966 to pursue the MA Marketing and graduated in 1967.
I was part of a group of 25 graduate students and on graduating in 1967, we were the first to obtain a university degree in a management in the UK.
The Robbins Report on Higher Education published in 1963 showed that except for the ten Colleges of Advanced Technology (all now Universities in their own right offering the Higher National Diploma (HND) in Business Studies) management studies unlike the USA had not been deemed to be a subject suitable for academic pursuit at UK universities.
The report gave birth to the Manchester and London Business Schools, whilst Lancaster responded with courses in Marketing, Operations Research and Accounting and Finance.
Bailrigg at the time was a construction site with only about 500 students, most being undergraduates who were relocated from a converted farm building on the outskirts of Lancaster.
The Lancaster degree gave me a solid background and facilitated my entry on to the PhD programme in Public Affairs Economics at the University of the West Indies in 1969.
In fact, my first job out of Lancaster was Assistant Market Research Manager with Lever Brothers and Associates at an enviable annual salary of £1,500.
The letter from Lever Brothers inviting me to an interview was posted by Andrew Reid on the Bowland College notice board.
I have been fortunate to have been able to pursue four distinct career paths, as a business manager (ending up as Chairman and President of Sprostons Jamaica Limited and Alcan Products of Jamaica Ltd, (part of Alcan Canadian Aluminium commercial companies in Kingston, Jamaica) and later Managing Director and part-owner of the Caterpillar agency (Powertrac Ltd) in Jamaican in 1985.
Whilst at Alcan, I was seconded to the government of Jamaica as a Dollar-a-Year Transport Adviser in 1976.
I also became chairman of the Jamaican Omnibus Company, the Kingston urban transport company.
Eventually, I joined the government in 1990 and served as Chief Technical Director to the Prime Minister of Jamaica, as Executive Director of the National Planning Council and later Chairman of the Airport Authority of Jamaica.
In 1995, I was awarded by the Government of Jamaica the Honour of Commander of the Order of Distinction (CD) for distinguished public service to Jamaica.
In 1991, I was invited by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West Indies to take up the post of Head of the Mona Institute of Business (a professorial level appointment) and Executive Director of the USAID Management Education Project.
I was responsible for setting up the graduate business school, the Executive MBA programme and to develop some 20 young Jamaicans to PhD level to become the main teaching resource for the Department of Management Studies and the Graduate Business School.
Finally, in 1998 I was recruited on contract by the UK Department of International Development (DFID) and seconded to the President’s Office in Tanzania, as Resident Privatisation and Utility Regulatory Adviser.
Since then I have been involved in international infrastructure consultancy business and currently involved in a project advising the government of the Sultanate of Oman on privatising the electricity grid companies.
I am delighted to have the opportunity to serve as an Ambassador to Lancaster University and to support student development, especially international economic and management students and students from the minority diaspora.
I would also like to support the Management School in developing a network of business schools to facilitate research, exchange of lecturers and students.
When I was invited to be involved in the activities of the university I willingly consented as this will mark my fifth career tract at the golden age of three score years and twenty.
I started my own accountancy practice 12 years ago specialising in R&D tax claims even though I swore I would never enter the profession.
Prior to that I held a number of great senior management positions varying from retail with Boots The Chemists to MD of an Electronics company exporting all over the world.
The wealth of experience was great.
I even managed to visit some remote and unusual areas of the world like Siberia and Kazakhstan.
As an Ambassador I am looking forward to helping make a difference to a future student and their progress.
The role of great institution like Lancaster University in the world has never been more important.
In addition to generating life-changing research, Lancaster University educates a significant number of our future leaders in science, engineering, business, public policy, history, education, law, journalism, and more.
In 2003, through a Chevening Scholarship program, I came to study MSc in Finance at Lancaster University where I am proud to have graduated with Distinction, and I must say that my study here played a pivotal role in my life.
The Lancaster University laid a solid foundation and offered me a deeper perspective of competitiveness, friendship, excellence and openness.
Several years after my study, I have risen through the ranks in my career to now lead Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, one of the largest conglomerates on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, as its President and Group Chief Executive Officer.
In gratitude and to help Lancaster University impact on more lives, I feel honoured to lend a hand of support to the school that has shaped who I have come to be today.
In the words of John Kennedy "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." In light of this quote and in appreciation of Lancaster, I pledge to continually live by this quote.
Martin spent his time at Lancaster University undertaking his MSc in the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Studies (SECAMS) and graduated in 1993 as a mature student.
He went on to study for his MBA that had a focus on strategy within the private sector.
It is without a doubt that his MSc and MBA have served him well throughout his career while he has no hesitation in stating that without his degrees he would not have enjoyed the success that has been noted.
Success that has called upon his original degree certificates many times in the past 20-years and more!

I am 47 years old and started my career in advertising in 1994 in National Press in London and worked my way from traditional media into digital in 1998.
I’ve worked for Yahoo!, ITV, and Reed Elsevier and have held senior commercial roles getting involved in sales across to mergers and acquisitions.

Over the past 20 years Tobi Doeringer has established and run companies in the IT, consulting, trading, manufacturing, as well as the entertainment and leisure field, today consolidated under Vabella Limited.
Mr Doeringer is also a Director at Mascotte Industrial Associates founded by a family member and today part of a publically listed subsidiary of Tencent Holdings.
His studies at Frankfurt International School with over 60 different nationalities allow Mr Doeringer to identify and clarify the cultural intricacies in Vabella’s international consulting function.
Mr Doeringer continued his studies at the Lancaster University Management School in the UK and the Otto Beisheim School of Management (WHU) in Germany running his own retail marketing and real estate management businesses before focusing on Asia and moving to Hong Kong in the mid 1990s.
Mr Doeringer is a full member of the Hong Kong Management Association, Fellow at the Hong Kong Institute of Directors, WHU Alumni Ambassador and Charter President of the Rotary Club of Shouson Hill.
I studied MA in Accounting & Finance (1993-94).
Though it was just one year, to me, a life-changing experience.
I learned and experienced a lot, very different from Hong Kong.
Some good friends I knew there are still in frequent contact today.
The academic qualification and overseas experience helped advance my career in banking, and teaching at a later stage.
Now I entered the second chapter of my life and became a sustainability consultant, studying a PhD degree, teaching at universities and more...
A fad: "Slash Worker" is the best term to describe my current status
All these are attributed to the moment I decided to study at Lancaster University.
I would like to support overseas students to come to Lancaster for perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
I am currently the Chief Investment Officer for the Nationwide Pension Fund following a long and varied career within Nationwide Building Society.
This involved Treasury and Commercial divisions having commenced my career in the branch network.
Often with a focus on developing new business activities including the establishment of the Society’s secured lending programmes.
My current role involves understanding a wide variety of different investment opportunities, strategy setting, stakeholder management and risk management with an overriding objective of ensuring the benefits due to 30,000 members of the fund are met in full.
As a mutual, the ethos of Nationwide has always embodied a spirt of collaboration and co-operation that has appealed to me and with a constant source of new and interesting activities has let me have a rich and fulfilling career.
In a way, my time a Lancaster was not dissimilar to Nationwide, the collegiate and campus atmosphere and approach of the University is one of co-operation and stimulating its students; one which has provided me with the platform for my career.
Now I am very pleased to be asked to be an Ambassador for the University and perhaps provide some hopefully helpful messages of support for current students.
I was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1958 and educated at Kings School Tynemouth 1966-1977.
I then went on to study Economics, Accountancy and Law at Lancaster from 1977-1980.
Upon the completion of my studies, I returned to Newcastle and joined Price Waterhouse as an article clerk and qualified as a chartered accountant (ICAEW) in 1984.
I worked in London for Pricewaterhouse 1984-1986 then returned to Newcastle to establish what became a national chain of 77 convenience stores and 8 supermarkets employing over 2,000 people and turning over £170m per annum including £90m of service sales.
I sold the stores to Tesco in March 2011 and then went on to co-found The Lakes Distillery in April 2012, which is now England’s leading whisky distillery with many award winning spirits in its brand portfolio.
The vision is to produce one of the world’s finest single malt whiskies in the World Category.
I was awarded a CBE in the 2018 New Year’s honours list for services to Entrepreneurship in the North East and co-founding The Lakes Distillery.
The reason I decided to support the philanthropists program supporting student hardship was that throughout my 40 plus years in business many people from all walks of life have helped me and in a small way this helps others with their life/business journey.

I am fortunate to have had a very long and wonderful association with Lancaster University, and I am delighted to be an Ambassador; to help students have the opportunity of a fantastic education and life experience, regardless of background or financial means, was a key attraction for me.
I came from a loving home but it did not have many books in it, and I was, not untypically at age 18, somewhat unfocused.
I somehow managed to get into Lancaster University and quite frankly have never looked back.
After graduating in 1984 with a 2.1 and the Ciba Geigy Law prize, I worked for KPMG and tutored part time at the University in support of a KPMG sponsored Chair.
I lead the same tutorial in the same room some six years after I had experienced it (Alumni will remember Anthony and Reece).
I then moved to Baxi Partnership (a large employee owned company with a very large private share market) as Finance Director undertaking acquisitions in Europe to expand the brand and technology internationally.
During my tenure there, I assisted a Lancaster PhD student with a thesis on share valuation methodologies.
I am currently the Vice Chairman of Westmorland Limited after a long spell as Managing Director.
Westmorland are better known for Tebay Services on the M6 in Cumbria, and four years ago we built the new Gloucester Services on the M5.
Our business model focuses on sustainably connecting people with place and rooting ourselves in a community through local sourcing, local employment and local charitable support; it is widely regarded as an exemplar and disruptor in its industry.
We have about 10 million visitors each year to all of our businesses.
Gloucester Services is multi award winning and was officially opened by Prince Charles in 2014.
Lancaster University even played a part in this project as I asked the Department of Mathematics to undertake some statistical analysis of road safety in support our planning application.
From 2008 - 2016 I was a Council member of the University and I chaired the Finance and General Purposes Committee from 2010 until 2016.
In 2018 I have been a lay member on the Pensions Working Group.
I have found the whole experience incredibly rewarding.
As in 1981, today Lancaster University remains a superb teaching institution and accessible to all with a wonderful collegiate experience.
The campus also continues to be developed for the future demands of higher education in this rapidly advancing age in which we now live.
Like other Ambassadors, I appreciate this opportunity to show students how Lancaster provides such a fantastic springboard into the world of work.
Lancaster is an internationally recognised university that I am proud to be associated with, and it has been a privilege to remain connected.
I am a tax partner in MHA MacIntyre Hudson, a top 20 UK accountancy practice.
I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and also the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners.
I joined the firm on graduation from Lancaster in 1987 as a tax trainee and worked at our Bedford, Milton Keynes and North London offices before moving to head up the tax practice at our City office, in London in October 2017.
In my time at MHA MacIntyre Hudson, I have encountered a wide range of tax issues, particularly those impacting on entrepreneurial enterprises, professional practices and high net wealth individuals both from a UK and from a cross-border perspective.
Also, I have widely acted as expert witness, providing taxation analysis in professional indemnity and matrimonial cases.
Whilst I did not directly pursue a career in law, the background that my degree provided has been and indeed remains invaluable.
Graduated from Lancaster University in 1978 and joined Deloittes in Birmingham and qualified as a Chartered Accountant.
Held several senior finance positions in construction, recruitment, training and education, then established my own consultancy business at the age of 38 providing business consultancy to a diverse range of SME companies across the West Midlands.
A fortuitous meeting with my current business partner in 1996 lead to the establishment Care First Group in 1996 providing learning and developmental opportunities to adults with learning disabilities and complex needs.
Helping individuals with a range of moderate to complex learning disabilities, we help them to progress in a “person centred” way so that they lead fulfilling and enjoyable lives.
Today we employ over 100 staff and have 170 students benefitting from our day provision.
Our provision saves significant costs to the NHS and Criminal Justice system and helps families stay together.
I am Chairman of Edward’s Trust, a West Midlands bereavement charity supporting parents and children through loss and am a committed Christian involved in mentoring fellow Christians develop their faith.
I am also a director of a small dementia charity, Mindful Gifts CIC, which provides support through a range of products and activities to people suffering with dementia.
Lancaster University changed my life.
From a secondary modern school that offered little ambition, I was lucky enough to encounter people who encouraged me to believe in myself and Lancaster University stretched me academically.
It provided me with an environment to grow in confidence, surrounded by a diverse range of undergraduates all studying different subjects.
Nothing could have been more enriching in terms of politics, business and economics, human and social issues.
Lancaster formed the bedrock that would shape my life.
Being an ambassador for Lancaster was an easy choice for me.
How could I ignore investing back into the university that gave me so much whilst trying to help those students with some level of need?
Having a daughter with Downs Syndrome and seeing the potential of those less fortunate, is a key driver to being an Ambassador.
I am blessed with 3 beautiful daughters and a fiancé and an Australian terrier, love playing squash, running, hill walking and general keep fit.
The occasional abseil and half marathon enables me to fundraise.
I love my cars too!!!

He also worked in the editorial team for the college magazine.
Steve became a frequent visitor to the Computer Labs and was inspired to apply for jobs in the computer industry following graduation.
His initial employer was ICL in Manchester, where Steve spent five years programming software to simulate and test electronic circuit designs used for ICL’s mainframe computers.
This led to a long and enjoyable career in the nascent but growing EDA (Electronic Design Automation) market with companies including Unisys, Teradyne, Viewlogic and Synopsys.
Steve’s move from software engineering to product marketing eventually led to him moving with his family to the San Francisco Bay Area, also known as Silicon Valley.
Steve retired from Synopsys after more than 20 years, where his responsibilities covered a broad range of electronic systems markets, including computing, communications and automotive.
During his time in “the Valley”, Steve also operated a boutique winery, Three Arches Winery (named after the three-car garage where the initial batch of wine was made), with a group of close friends and their families.
Steve currently resides with his wife, Rose, in Los Angeles, CA.
Their four grown children live within California.

Halls Food Group is something of a phoenix.
This third-generation family business, founded in Chorley in 1933 and famous in central Lancashire for its pies and other bakery products, nearly ran aground in 2007 when mounting debts led it to go into voluntary liquidation.
But when the company’s current MD, Joe Hall, stepped in to buy back the assets, this was the start of a remarkable turn-around.
10 years on, the company has two retail premises and a corporate catering service, a fleet of 7 mobile shops providing a lunchtime delivery service to workplaces across the whole of Central Lancashire.
Its achievements have been marked by a number of awards – including Customer Focus Award at the 2010 Bakery Industry Awards and Retailer of the Year at Lancashire’s 2011 Be Inspired Business Award.
Joe Hall is unequivocal about the role played by the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development Leadership Development programme in helping him refocus and reshape the company’s strategic direction.
Joe says that “LEAD has been instrumental because it created a forum for things to be discussed with people from outside the business.” Following on from LEAD Joe took part in the GOLD programme which he considers consolidated all that he had already learned.
Now an Entrepreneur in Residence, Joe is enjoying giving back some of what he has learned.
Alongside being active in his role as an EIR, Joe was appointed to the board of BAKO NW Ltd in 2014 and is currently the Vice Chairman.
Additionally, in 2016, he was appointed as a voting member of the Board of the Small Business Charter.

I grew up on a collective farm in China, and often went to bed hungry.
I always wanted to do something significant to help the village people, the peasants, because I was one of them, and because our lives were really hard.
In 1985, I came from China, to carry out research at Lancaster University to find out how to grow more crops with less water.
Northwest and Northern China faces an unprecedented water-shortage crisis, with well over 50% of China’s food production under constant threat of drought.
Since returning home, my work has focused on research into water-saving crop production.
We have developed some promising water-saving methods which have successfully reduced crop water use by almost half in some areas.
The seeds of these achievements were sown in the labs of Lancaster University many years ago.
It was at Lancaster that we discovered mechanisms by which plants can sense the soil drying and reduce their water loss.
I was extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to be involved in this effort with talented researchers at Lancaster and it has shaped the course of my life’s work.
We live in challenging times.
We already use almost all the world’s arable land to grow crops and now water resources are declining in many parts of the world.
It is my hope that through philanthropic support of Food Security research many more students from all around the world – especially from those countries whose food supply is most under threat from limited natural resources – will be able to make their careers in plant science, or the many other disciplines working to ensure a safe supply of food for the world.
There are many ways the research can be supported but to have young students to do the work is most important.
My life was changed forever by my time at Lancaster.
Please consider giving your support to students who want to learn how to help deliver their countries from the threat of food insecurity in the challenging times that lie ahead.
In doing so, you will be helping them to change their lives as they become part of the growing research community dedicated to finding collective solutions that will benefit millions.
It could be one of the best investments you ever make.

When I arrived at Lancaster, my plan was to study English Literature, though without any clear sense of where it might lead.
In truth, I was just thrilled to have dodged the world of work for a few years.
Under the Lancaster system, I 'minored' in Law and Politics in my first year and this enabled me to convert to a Law degree - and this set the course for my professional life.
After leaving, I took an LLM at Cambridge and then qualified as a solicitor, specialising in employment law.
It is no coincidence that whilst I was at Lancaster, the head of the Law Department was Peter Wallington, an inspiring employment lawyer.
Since 1986, I have been with the same law firm, Clifford Chance.
I became a partner in 1995 and global head of employment law in 2003.
The firm, which belongs to what (infuriatingly for other firms) is known as the 'Magic Circle', has provided me with an endlessly challenging and highly rewarding career due in part to those at Lancaster who set me on the road to the 'city'.
I also have Lancaster to thank for some enduring friendships.
A number of us still meet up occasionally to reminisce and visit old haunts.
It takes only a few minutes for us to fall into our old routines and we are soon recounting (and embellishing) our shared experiences as students.
I was very pleased to be asked to be an Ambassador for the University and to have an opportunity to offer a message of support to those debating whether to embark on student life (with all that now entails) and, in particular, whether to apply to Lancaster.
My answer is an unequivocal 'yes' to both questions - take the plunge as you may be about to start the best years of your life.
I retired as a partner in 2019 but continue as a Consultant to the firm and also to new model law firm, Keystone Law.
I have also been appointed as an ACAS Arbitrator.
I am a partner at Pryor Cashman LLP, a mid-sized law firm based in New York City.
I specialize in the transactional aspects of technology and intellectual property exploitation (patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyright) and have represented a broad range of clients, from small start-up companies to large, well established companies like Godiva Chocolatier and celebrities like Lady Gaga, in a variety of industries including telecommunications, life sciences, entertainment, digital media and software.
Away from the office, I spend most of my time enjoying my family and outdoor sports, particularly skiing and soccer.
I'm a particularly passionate reader of historical fiction, especially Patrick O'Brian's "Aubrey-Maturin" series.
My best Lancaster memory is a toss-up between enjoying The Men From Uncle, a band consisting of mostly Lonsdale residents who are now long-time friends, Professor Fox's history classes, and being a member of the Rugby League team (who knew there were two kinds of Rugby?)
I support Lancaster University because the University introduced me to so many wonderful people from all over the globe, many of whom I've kept in touch with over the years, and I want to help others do the same thing.
Lucy studied theatre and sculpture at Lancaster University from 1985-1988 and then went on to train as an actress at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, graduating in 1991.
Her recent theatre credits include Show Boat at Sheffield Crucible and the New London Theatre, The Seagull and Ivanov at the Chichester Festival Theatre, Wolf Hall & Bring Up The Bodies with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Swan Theatre, Stratford Upon Avon, The Aldwych Theatre, London and The Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway, NYC.
Lucy also performed her one woman show in London and New York, 'Some Kind of Bliss', written for her by the playwright Samuel Adamson.
Recent television credits include Count Arthur Strong, DCI Banks, The Thick Of It, The Night Watch and 2012, although she is still recognised as Mary Bennett in the iconic BBC production of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, despite it being filmed nearly 25 years ago...
Lucy has also enjoyed varied work on radio and providing narration for documentaries; most notably the Channel 4 series Body Shock and two series of ITV's Ladette to Lady.
Lucy is thrilled to be a patron of the new Lancaster Playwriting Prize as new writing is a passion for her.
There is nothing more exciting for an actor than to be the first person to speak the words of a young playwright and bring the first interpretation of their work to life on stage.
Lancaster University, even in its early days was a vibrant complex multi-faceted society, enclosed in its own mist-enshrouded draughty cultural pressure cooker on a hill outside the city.
In the Great Hall, Leyla rubbed shoulders with Die schöne Müllerin, while in the middle of the campus a group of bemused capitalist lackeys (otherwise known as the administration staff) would file out onto the Square as the placard-waving Trotskyists began a sit-in.
It was possible to conduct a respectable pub crawl without even leaving the campus, and there was an opportunity to sample to the delights of coastal living with a year out in Morecambe.
For me Lancaster facilitated the transition from insecure pimply ex-schoolboy to a somewhat more secure and less pimply young adult, newly launched on what as been a very long and fulfilling career.
But the real gain from my years at Lancaster has proved to be much more subtle.
Now as I reach the end of my career, and, aided by a large glass of single malt, I look back wistfully through a life hopefully well-lived.
And I feel a growing sense of indebtedness for the richness with which my experience at Lancaster infused my life, without me realising it at the time.
I am left with a strong sense of being very privileged to have been at Lancaster.
In 1975 I was fortunate enough to win the Colorado Scholarship, which provided a year of postgraduate study at the University of Colorado in Boulder, funded entirely by contributions from American Junior Year Abroad students at Lancaster.
It was a transformational experience, and one made possible by the generosity of others.
And so the time has arrived for me to give something back, to help to create opportunities for new generations of students, and hopefully to arm them, not with just a vocational meal ticket but with some truly life enhancing experiences attitudes and skills.
I am delighted to be an ambassador for the University, and I hope this initiative is just the start of something really special, something of which every alumnus can be proud.

I spent three wonderful years at Lancaster University as an undergraduate.
My choice of university was determined by the variety of options on the LLB degree programme, as well as the distance from London and my parents!
When I came to visit I immediately fell in love with the campus and the great atmosphere, despite it raining the whole day and missing the coach back to London.
I lived at Lonsdale College during my first year, as the Law Department in 1986 was located there and it meant I could attend my lectures with minimum effort.
I enjoyed my degree immensely and found as a law student I was working hard from day one.
The weight of the work did not prevent me from taking part in a range of extra-curricular activities and I would encourage every student to try something new.
I made life-long friends at the university and was even fortunate enough to meet my husband there, so I can certainly confirm that my time at Lancaster left a lasting impression.
I always believed that law was an excellent discipline as grounding for a range of careers and when I left Lancaster I was still not sure whether I was going to teach or pursue a career in law.
As a consequence, I hedged my bets and completed the Law Society Finals at the College of Law in Chester to allow me to become a solicitor.
Then a year later, I elected to do a Postgraduate degree in Company and Commercial Law at the University of London, as a path to becoming a lecturer.
However, once my postgraduate studies were at an end I decided to embark on a career as a solicitor.
I began as an Articled Clerk (showing my age!) for the commercial firm Rosenblatt and once qualified I moved and specialised in Commercial Litigation.
Later, after starting a family I decided to change practice areas and I am now a Property lawyer.
As a Partner for ten years I have trained solicitors, trainees and paralegals thereby using my “teaching gene” and have therefore had the best of both worlds.
I am delighted to have the opportunity to be an Ambassador and support students to maximise the value of their studies regardless of their background or financial means.
I was the first female in my family to go to university and my law degree gave me the confidence and ability to go out into the world and make a successful career and life for myself, my family and others.
Over the years I have supported charities and schools to improve the lives of those relying upon the services they provide.
When I was asked to be involved in supporting this initiative I agreed it could bring about life changing outcomes and was keen to play my part.

Jane has been in the executive search industry for 18 years, and is presently a Managing Director at RSR Partners in New York City.
She recruits trustees, advisory board members, and senior executives for institutional investors and family offices.
Upon graduation from Lancaster University with a degree in politics she returned to the United States and earned an MBA from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

She currently resides with her husband in Bronxville, NY.
Her two grown daughters are educators living in Portland, Oregon and New York City, and her son is a real estate investor living in Chicago.
I moved to the UK and joined Lancaster University in 2015 as Director of Recruitment Admissions and International Development and was appointed Principal of Cartmel later that year.
Whilst researching Lancaster prior to joining I was struck how a university so young, in a system that is centuries old, came to be ranked and regarded so highly.
There are many elements to why, but one key is the collegiate system.
I have had the good fortune to benefit from a career that has provided both work and personal experiences in many countries around the world.
As a high school leaver and first generation university graduate from a small town in Eastern Canada it is a somewhat atypical journey.
The turning point was a decision to pursue a university education.
I am pleased to be in a position to be able to contribute to Cartmel College and Lancaster University to support the students of today and tomorrow in pursuit of their goals.

After three years of studies and a lot of fun, I graduated from Lancaster in 2006.
Not only did I earn a degree from one of the top UK University, but I also left the school with fond memories, I met my wife and the mother of my son, and had the necessary tools to start a career in finance.
10 years later, I am working as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer for a startup in the shipping industry.
When I was invited by the university to join the Ambassador programme, I did not hesitate very long.
It feels like a normal thing to give back.
I consider that I have a good job and I am lucky for that, I owe that hard work but also to Lancaster University and everything I learned there.
Lancaster University provides strong academic background to its students; the university has done its part of the job, now it is up to the Alumni community to help the university to build a solid reputation globally.
We need to ensure that its students are represented everywhere including the most prestigious institutions – we will all benefit from it.
Helping the university to achieve this goal is not pure altruism but also the fruit of selfish interest… So I hope that this donation, amongst many others, will help student from all background to maximise the value of their studies, have great careers and that they can themselves give back to the university in the future and help grow its reputation.
Born in 1967 in Northern Ireland Roger joined Bowland College in 1986 studying psychology, philosophy and law in his first year and extending his interest in aesthetics from the Philosophy Department with a paper considering the potential impact of applying the principles of judicial precedent in the analysis and criticism of art and vice versa.
After solicitor’s finals at the College of Law in York Roger completed his training contract with a large West End firm in London with whom he remained for a short time after qualification in the banking department before moving to join Peter Woodroffe at Woodroffes, a boutique practice in London’s Belgravia.
Woodroffes was founded in 1877 representing individuals and families of substantial personal wealth and has continued to do so for the intervening 140 years.
Roger became a partner in 1999 and senior partner upon Peter Woodroffe’s retirement (to consultant) in 2010.
Roger had built a personal practice in the intervening years representing the hotel and hospitality trade and acting for a number of five-star hotels and Michelin starred restaurants.
His firm continues to offer a highly personalised and bespoke service to wealthy individuals from across the UK and all corners of the world, creating and managing investment portfolios of commercial and residential property across the UK, often in a Sharia’ compliant manner.
Roger deals with deal making and non contentious matters.
In his spare time Roger is a season ticket holder at Tottenham Hotspur and a fan of most forms of sport, particularly motor sport.
He enjoys cars, motoring, fine dining and travel and tries to see live contemporary music as frequently as practical.
Roger dislikes most “classical” music.
After graduating, I trained as an Actuary in Liverpool.
On qualifying in 1974, I joined stockbrokers Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh as an analyst in insurance shares, becoming a partner in 1981.
After the financial ‘Big Bang’, I joined Commercial Union in 1988, initially leading the Group’s planning and strategy function, before becoming a UK Divisional Director and latterly business development director of the fund management arm.
After retiring from full time work in 2000, I have concentrated on other areas of learning, with postgraduate qualifications in Art History and the History of Ideas from the University of Buckingham, Birkbeck College and SOAS
While my subjects were fundamental for my career choice and development, Lancaster was also invaluably ‘horizon-broadening’.
My final year Operational Research project working with some Ugandan Asians, who had settled in Preston after expulsion by Idi Amin was eye opening regarding other peoples’ life experiences.
From a personal interest viewpoint, I still remember the series of concerts marking Beethoven’s bicentenary in 1970.
More widely, the very lively social and political atmosphere and events of the period, the stormy debates at the student assemblies and the late night kitchen discussions have proven to be long lasting influences.
I hope that current generations of students have the opportunity for similarly rewarding experiences.

Lancaster University has retained a place in my affections ever since I did a one-year MA in the early 70’s, in what was then called Operational Research.
It was a genuinely enjoyable year, but also a major influence in my life and subsequent career.
As a consequence I have supported the University in several ways over the years, and am now delighted to extend this by becoming a patron.
My very early career was in Operational Research – I had a passion to use mathematical techniques to solve real, rather than purely theoretical, problems.
However I subsequently found that the structured approach to problem solving was perhaps the most relevant skill I had learnt at Lancaster.
This and the experience of studying, in a class of students drawn from different cultures and backgrounds, were the really important aspects for me.
My career was mainly with Mars Incorporated - the family owned global food business.
Early on I was fortunate to be able to work in several different functions including marketing, logistics, systems, planning, before following a career in finance.
I moved with my family to Holland where I became head of the S&F (Service & Finance) Division for the groups European confectionery business.
We subsequently moved again, this time to the US where at the end of my career I was in charge of the S&F Division for the North American Region, which included pet food as well as confectionery – Mars is the global market leader in both.
My wife and I have lived in Williamsburg Virginia since I retired in the mid noughties.
My life now revolves around family; volunteer activity – I am Board Chair of a local charity, and coach local Business School MBA students on leadership; travel photography; and golf.
I remain close friends with several of my class at Lancaster.
We are all delighted to see how the University has developed from its early days to today – now an internationally ranked institution.
I look forward to this progress being continued, but know that it will take resources, and hope others will reflect back on their time there and also want to help with this.

Mike credits much of his career achievement to his excellent education and sound grounding in economic principles.
This appreciation has inspired him to lead a project to raise money to fund a Chair in Industrial Economics at Lancaster.
Mike has particularly warm memories of his tutor, Elizabeth Brunner, whose guidance and wise counsel he believes played a huge part in his success.
As Mike puts it, “Elizabeth was very instrumental in my career, firstly as my tutor on the prestigious S321 course, which she ran superbly.
She encouraged me to stay at Lancaster to do my Master's, with my thesis on Pricing in the Motor Car Industry and then helped me with my first role as an Economist for Urwick, Orr and Partners.

In 1981, I returned home with a thankful heart to start a 30-year career as a weather scientist.
Though back in Hong Kong, I have always maintained close contact with the University and provided advice on student matters.
In 1986, local graduates began to lend support at the British Education Week to recruit new students to Lancaster.
Later that same year, these devoted graduates formed an alumni association which is still active today.
It is pleasing to learn about the meaningful fundraising Programme and I am happy to be a Patron and give a regular contribution as a gesture of reciprocation to the University.
There will always be students in need and I strongly believe that given the chance of quality education at Lancaster, these youngsters could also make their dreams come true.

For a student, the application process for university can sometimes be a little stressful or overwhelming, and they will look to you to help them through this process.
See below some key milestones to help familiarise yourself with the various stages of a student's application.
The first step in the process of going to university is research.
There are so many universities and courses available to prospective students that beginning this research can feel quite overwhelming.
Narrowing down the options available can be a time consuming process so it is best to begin researching early.
You can be a big help in assisting and supporting prospective students in this research.
Some valuable ways you can help your student include:
The next step is for the student to prepare and send off their UCAS application.
They will have five spaces to fill on their application (this can be a mixture of different universities and courses) and they will also have to complete a personal statement.
UCAS has a website with helpful information to guide you through the year.
This contains advice on how to support a student through filling out the application process and how to help them write their personal statement.
UCAS applications open in September each year, and the initial deadline for most courses is in January.
However, Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary, and Oxbridge applications close in October.
Your student’s school or college will have clear deadlines to support the UCAS application process.
These internal deadlines can vary considerably between schools and colleges so it is useful to be aware of when these dates may be.
You can view the complete list of undergraduate UCAS key dates.
You may find it useful to visit our Lancaster specific webpages.
Here you can find specific information about applying for undergraduate study at Lancaster , as well as details on what happens after your student has submitted their application .
Applying for student finance can be one of the most daunting parts of the process for prospective students and is often the point at which they require the most support from you.
Applications are made through the government Student Finance website.
UK/EU Student Finance applications should be submitted by the end of May to guarantee payment at the start of the first term.
If your student is applying for a student loan based on household income, you may need to give Student Finance information about your income.

It is also shared with universities to allow consideration for additional financial support, such as our Lancaster Bursary .
You can find out everything you need to know about the information you will need to provide and all other details of the process here:
Some universities host Offer Holder Events which students can attend after receiving an offer from a university.
These differ to Open Days as they are often focused more closely on your student's department.
They can offer another opportunity to meet current students and academics and to ask any questions that might influence the decision of which university the student wants to place as their firm or insurance choice.
After receiving an offer from Lancaster University, students will be invited to attend an Offer Holder Event to meet their department and learn more about the course they have applied for.
These typically run between February and April.
Regarding receiving offers from universities, each university will work at different timescales.
At Lancaster, our Admissions Team aims for decisions to be made within three weeks of receiving the application.
However, during particularly busy periods and when their are other factors in the decision-making process (e.g.
an interview or portfolio assessment) there may be a longer wait to hear back from us.
Please also remember that applications submitted just before holiday periods (e.g.
Christmas) will take longer to process.
For some subjects including Medicine and Surgery, Physics, Architecture, Social Work and MEng degrees students may also be invited for an interview.
One way that you can offer them support during this time is to offer to practice interview techniques and possible questions with them in advance.
Once your student has received all their offers, it’s up to them to make their decision on which universities to place as their firm and insurance places and which to decline.
Their firm choice should be the university and course they would most like to attend and may have slightly higher entry requirements.
Their insurance choice should be their second choice university or course and should be one they would still be happy to attend if they do not get the required grades for their firm choice.
Often the insurance choice will have slightly lower advertised entry requirements but this is not a requirement.
Students will then have to reject any other offers they have received.
This can be a stressful time for students and we encourage all our applicants to take the time to make the right choice for them rather than rushing into a quick acceptance.
During this time students may seek your advice on the offers they receive and ask for your opinion on their options.
Once the student has made their decision on which universities and courses to place as their firm and insurance choices they begin the final stage of preparation.
During this period they will typically be focusing on their academic studies through a combination of revision, exams and remaining coursework.
This can be a stressful time for students and it is important to offer them the support they need, whether this be helping them with their revision or encouraging them to take breaks when needed.
If a student has a change of heart, and would like to be considered for an alternative course, we’re happy to consider this provided they meet the requirements and space remains available on the course.
They’ll need to contact our Admissions team to request this.
If they are planning to move away for university then this is point at which they also have the exciting decision of what accommodation they would like to pick.
At Lancaster, if a student has made us their firm or insurance choice we will contact them with options in the summer and invite them to choose their accommodation and college.
Other universities will operate on a different timeline so it is important to check how to process operates at each institution.
Then comes the scary yet exciting time of Results day !
If a student meets the conditions of their firm choice, they will have their place confirmed via UCAS .
Sometimes a university needs additional information from the student (for example, if you have to confirm details of the transcript) and we will be in contact directly.
If the university does not require any further information the status of their application will be amended from conditional to unconditional, and pre-arrival information will follow.
Sometimes a student will not meet the grades for their firm choice but will meet those of their insurance.
In that case, their application will change to their insurance institution and be amended to unconditional and again, pre-arrival information will follow.
If they are not accepted by both their firm and insurance choices, they will enter UCAS Clearing.
Clearing is an opportunity for students without a place at university to find one as universities seek to fill any remaining course spaces.
Find out more information about Clearing at Lancaster and the entry criteria.
Once a student has their place confirmed at university the final stage is to help them prepare for their university transition.
If they are moving away to university, it is at this point that they will have to begin shopping for their essential items.
You may find it useful to find a packing list online for inspiration.
This period can also be a good time for your student to practice any skills they might need to develop for university such as cooking or doing their own washing.
Your student will be sent all of the information they need ahead of time.
They will arrive at Lancaster for Welcome Week which is a time for them to settle in, meet people and get to know the campus ahead of starting their studies.

About the Lecture
Can legislation protect future generations?
From pioneering the UK’s first plastic bag charge to creating legislation that has been praised as a global model by the UN, Jane Davidson’s career as a policymaker, educator, and environmental advocate demonstrates how bold ideas can lead to lasting change.This lecture will discuss the ethics and values behind her approach to policymaking, drawing from her acclaimed book #futuregen: Lessons From a Small Country.Jane Davidson will explain how, as Minister for Environment, Sustainability and Housing in Wales, she proposed what became the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 – the first piece of legislation in history to put sustainability and future generations at the core of government decision-making.
Lauded by the United Nations, this law has sparked global conversations about how governments can rethink democracy, tackle climate change, and foster long-term well-being.
Joining Jane for a panel discussion are two Lancaster University academics:Professor Rebecca Willis, a specialist in Energy and Climate Governance, will discuss how democracy must adapt to address today’s environmental challenges, and Dr Temidayo Eseonu, Lecturer in Policy and Politics, who will explore how we can create a more inclusive, participatory democracy where every voice matters - especially those often marginalised.

An introduction to the early Quaker leader, theologian and organiser Margaret Fell (1614-1702) and to how her life and thought is still important today.
Fell is best known for her central role in establishing and supporting the Quaker movement from her home at Swarthmoor Hall (near Ulverston), for her influential early statements of Quaker principles, and for her arguments in defence of women’s preaching and leadership.

We now know that the womb is not the pitch-black environment we once imagined and it is rich in sounds from the external world.
The prenatal period is a time of intense and rapid development and our brain and sensory systems develop to surprisingly sophisticated levels.
As a newborn baby, we already prefer to look at faces (and things that look like faces), listen to infant-directed speech, and can tell the difference between small sets of numbers and different emotional sounds.
We have a wealth of knowledge of how these abilities are then shaped by our environment throughout childhood into our adult abilities to see, for example, faces in cars and cloud formations, and to count to infinite number sets.
But, how are the things that we hear, see, taste, and feel before birth already influencing our abilities and preferences for what we like to see and listen to after birth?
This talk discusses the importance of asking these questions and introduce the ways in which our research has overcome barriers to investigating the psychological development of the fetus in the womb.
For example, we have shown that the preference for faces exists before birth using 4D ultrasound imaging.
Following this work listed as one of the “Top 100 Discoveries of 2017” by Discover Magazine, this talk provides an account of what we have since learned from the use of ultrasound to measure fetal response to different emotions, types of speech, and shapes of light.
Dr Kirsty Dunn is a lecturer in Developmental Psychology at Lancaster University.
She specialises in the investigation of perceptual, cognitive, and social development in utero and throughout the first year of life.
Using light and 4D ultrasound, Kirsty and her global team have pioneered a new window into discovering how those remarkable abilities that we already have at birth develop before we are born.
In this lecture Professor Joe Moran discusses the university as an ideal, and as a real place.
What should a university stand for, who should be allowed to study there, and what should a degree lead to?
Does the university still have value as a physical space in an age of online learning?
As part of the lecture, Joe draws on the experience of his parents as two of the first students at Lancaster University in 1964.
They were first-generation students from working-class backgrounds with non-standard qualifications, and Lancaster was the only university to accept them.
How has the experience of being at university changed since they were students nearly sixty years ago?
Professor Joe Moran is a lecturer in English and Cultural History at Liverpool John Moores University.
He is a literary and cultural historian focusing on Britain in the very recent past, with a particular interest in the everyday.
He writes for The Guardian, The New Statesman, The Financial Times, BBC History Magazine, Times Higher Education and other publications, and has written a number of books including:
• 'Queuing for Beginners: The Story of Daily Life from Breakfast to Bedtime', a cultural history of daily habits in Britain in the postwar years, inspired by the work of Mass Observation;
• 'On Roads: A Hidden History', a circuitous journey around the British motorway system; and
• 'Armchair Nation: An Intimate History of Britain in Front of the TV', the story of watching television from Baird's first demonstration in Selfridge's in 1925 to the switching off of the analogue signal in 2012.
Baroness Catherine Ashton served as the European Union’s first High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from 2009 to 2014.
Ashton faced the challenge of representing the views and values of 28 nations during one of the most turbulent periods in living memory, leading historic negotiations such as the Serbia-Kosovo Accord of 2013 and the Iran nuclear negotiations.
She encountered dictators and war criminals, and witnessed the aftermath of natural disasters, military action and political instability.
In conversation, with Professor Andy Schofield and the Rt Hon Alastair Burt, she takes us behind the scenes to show us what worked and what didn’t, and how it felt to play a part in tackling some of the major international crises of our times.

As part of Lancaster University’s Public Lecture Series, BAFTA winning historian Dan Snow presented a talk exploring all the tools available to those who want to talk about, teach and enjoy history online.
A Lancaster Honorary Graduate, Dan has livestreamed on TikTok while searching for Shackleton's ship Endurance, posted on Instagram from WW1 biplanes and recorded podcasts from inside the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
When he started working there were no podcasts, no YouTube, no Facebook, no Netflix, no 3G mobile network and no iPhone.
So during the course of two decades Dan has responded to huge technological changes, taking advantage of huge new audiences… and sometimes embarrassing himself along the way!
Dan explores some of the strengths and weaknesses about making history accessible online, along with the opportunities and dangers of this revolution in broadcasting.

Nobel Prize Laureate and American physicist Professor William D.
Phillips, presents a captivating lecture featuring visually fascinating experiments and down-to-earth explanations on the topic of ‘Time, Einstein, and the Coolest Stuff in the Universe’.
Professor William D.
Phillips conducts some of the coolest explosive demonstrations with liquid nitrogen, whilst explaining how the use of ultracold atoms impacts on our everyday lives and allows us to test some of Einstein’s strangest predictions.

About the lecture
World-renowned physicist, Professor Phillips explores how the measurement of time is being revolutionised through the use of atomic clocks in our everyday lives – a development compared to how Einstein changed the way we think about time at the beginning of the 20th Century.
Now, early in the 21st Century, atomic clocks - the best timekeepers ever made - are one of the scientific and technological wonders of modern life.
Such super-accurate clocks are essential to industry, commerce, and science and at the heart of GPS (Global Positioning Systems) which guides cars, aeroplanes and hikers to their destinations.
Today, the best primary atomic clocks use ultracold atoms which achieve accuracies of about one second in 300 million years, and are getting better all the time.
A new generation of atomic clocks is also leading us to re-define what we mean by time.
Super-cold atoms, with temperatures that can be below a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, use, and allow tests of, some of Einstein’s strangest predictions.
In 1997, Professor Phillips shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for ‘development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light’.
He joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States in 1978 and is a member of the Laser Cooling and Trapping Group of NIST's Physical Measurement Laboratory.
Professor Phillips is also a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland.

The year is 2022.
We still fly in the 747 aeroplane that was unveiled in 1968 and teleportation still remains a fantasy.
School children in the early 1980s used Windows computers of the multi-purposing kind that we still use today.
Other than rising debt and global temperatures, almost everything else in our lives is slowing down, from technological advances to birth rates; and (possibly helped by the pandemic) also the number of aeroplane flights we take each year.
As we head towards what may look very much like stability, there is an urgent need for us all to work, buy, travel and do a little less with each day that passes.
Welcome to the future...

A hybrid lecture on compassionate leadership.
Watch the recording of the lecture on YouTube .
What role should kindness and compassion play in leadership?
Many of us are acquainted with the idea of leaders as ‘strong, effective and tough’, but should we be expecting more?
After an exceptionally challenging period where kindness and compassion have made the headlines more than they perhaps ordinarily would, Lancaster University brings to you a two-part hybrid public lecture hosted at the Health Innovation Campus and streamed online.
Our two speakers, Professor Mike Thomas (Chair, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust) and Professor Michael West (Professor of Organisational Psychology, Lancaster University and Senior Visiting Fellow, The King's Fund) explore what compassionate leadership involves, how we can become compassionate leaders and how we can overcome challenges that might prevent this culture being embedded in our places of work.

A panel of experts explore this changing relationship as well as the legacy of Covid-19 on the design, planning and use of social spaces.
The pandemic has made us re-think our relationship with space, with new home-seekers demonstrating different priorities, including a desire for more garden and working space.
But it's not just confined to spaces where we live.
Our experts will explore our changing relationship with space, and the legacy of Covid-19 on the design, planning and use of social spaces.
The Spaces of Social Distancing – Spearheading a Generative Signage Pilot Study for Lancaster.
Head of Architecture, Des Fagan, spearheaded a unique, automated social distancing and way-finding model for businesses preparing to re-open safely in the post-pandemic recovery.
The new model, devised with the University’s new School of Architecture, uses algorithms, special design exploration processes, generative software, sympathetic signage, electronically created floorplans and heat tracking and mapping to inspire a safe environment for people.
Working with Lancaster City Council, the project, funded through Beyond Imagination , a £13.2m Research England project at the University’s ImaginationLancaster , a design-led research laboratory, has gathered essential data on the way in which people use spaces in the pandemic.
The work will now form part of a further UKRI bid to provide the same methodology for the use of businesses at UK scale.
Filling our spaces with food growing places
Food plays a major role in our lives.
It’s essential for health and well-being and brings us together socially and culturally and, during the successive UK lockdowns, more people turned to growing their own food.
How we grow our food is also critical for our environment: 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food and agriculture, and our current ways of farming are a major driver of global biodiversity loss.
Whilst food can be a great connector, arguably our society is more disconnected than ever from how food is grown and from the natural processes that support farming.
In this talk Professor Jess Davies will consider if urban food growing offers us a solution: can growing more of what we eat nearer to where we live help us lead healthier more sustainable lives, and secure our fresh food supplies?
Space, Place and Behaviour in the Seattle Central Library
In the grips of Covid-19, the use of space has become incredibly important to many of us, as we yearn for familiar, communal spaces such as our local libraries.
Professor Ruth Conroy Dalton will present a series of studies on the Seattle Central Library, an enigmatic and simultaneously problematic space.
While winning major accolades and awards, the internet and social media were awash with accounts of people becoming lost in the space, almost succumbing to panic attacks, or posting photographs of the confusing, temporary signs that librarians were forced to improvise shortly after the building opened.
How can a building be considered a great architectural space whilst also a deeply problematic place to inhabit?
This talk will strive to get to the bottom of this paradox and explore how we can balance architectural innovation with human use.

Three experts from Lancaster University's Faculty of Health and Medicine discuss the impact of the pandemic and successive lockdowns on the health and wellbeing of frailer citizens.
How has Covid-19 affected the most vulnerable citizens in our country?
Exploring data collected from care homes and the national charity Parkinson's UK, three experts from Lancaster University's Faculty of Health and Medicine discuss the impact of the pandemic and successive lockdowns on the health and wellbeing of frailer citizens, what lessons have been learned, and how best practice can be adopted in the future.
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people affected by Parkinson’s
During the pandemic, those living with chronic health conditions have faced particular challenges, both due to the added risks of Covid-19 itself but also due to the impact of measures taken to reduce the spread, such as lockdown.
Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative condition which causes problems with slowness of movement, balance and tremor and also a wide range of other difficulties including with sleep, temperature control, pain and fatigue.
Psychological difficulties such as anxiety, depression and apathy are also commonly experienced as well as cognitive problems which can sometimes progress to dementia.
In order to highlight the impact of the pandemic period on people with Parkinson’s and their families and consider what support may be needed going forward, Professor Jane Simpson and Dr Fiona Eccles present findings from a survey carried out by national charity Parkinson’s UK of their members (including family carers) in the first lockdown in April-May 2020, and interviews conducted with people with Parkinson’s at several timepoints during the pandemic.
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people in Care Homes
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on adult social care.
Deaths in care homes in England over the first wave of the pandemic rose to approximately 150% of the same period the previous year.
There was large uncertainty over best practice for care homes over this period.
How can we optimise care to ensure COVID outbreak risks are minimised, while also ensuring that residents receive the most appropriate care possible?
In this talk Professor Jo Knight discusses findings from data collected from care homes and hospitals supplied by County Durham and Darlington Foundation Trust, and the resulting most appropriate course of action in such situation, which will then be widely applicable to policy regarding infectious disease outbreaks and transmission, such as Norovirus, in care homes in the future.
This work is part of the 12-month UKRI funded, 'Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on care home pathways, outcomes and safety of care' project.
Professor Jane Simpson is Professor of the Psychology of Neurodegenerative Conditions at Lancaster University.
As a clinical and academic psychologist, she conducts research to improve the wellbeing of individuals affected by chronic health conditions, and particular motor neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s.
Jane and Fiona have recently received two grants worth over £200,000 from UK funders to continue the work included in the presentation to be shared during this lecture.
Dr Fiona Eccles trained as a clinical psychologist and now works as a Lecturer at Lancaster University with research interests in the psychological wellbeing of people with neurological conditions, particularly Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease and dystonia.
Along with Professor Simpson, she has recently edited guidance for the British Psychological Society on psychological interventions for four neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson’s.
Professor Jo Knight is a Professor Applied Data Science at Lancaster University and the Research Director for Eden North.
She uses routinely collected data to improve the health outcomes of the population.
Her approaches are analytical and range from understanding triggers for disease to the utilisation of health services.
She also undertakes research on the genetic underpinnings of diseases.
The work she will discuss during the lecture is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

Three Lancaster University experts explore the concept of resilience through local initiatives taken during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the crisis on young people in low and middle-income countries.
In this lecture, Lancaster University experts explore the resilience of young people in low- and middle-income countries and, more locally, discuss how the Health Innovation Campus at Lancaster University acted as a catalyst for the region, and how the Lancaster University Management School supported a broad range of Lancashire & Cumbria enterprises through these difficult times.
Innovation through crisis and chaos – Dr Sherry Kothari with Annette Weekes
This talk outlines how Lancaster University's Health Innovation Campus (HIC) has been a catalyst for the region, especially in the last year, bringing together diverse stakeholders to identify and help tackle some of the significant societal and health challenges we face.
The pandemic has starkly highlighted the significant gaps in social and health equity, especially in our region.
The HIC will be instrumental in trying to shift the health paradigm from treatment to prevention, with an emphasis on the wider determinants of health.
Bringing together different sectors, communities, agencies and disciplines is a first step in solving major problems – encouraging collaboration, co-design and buy-in – and ensuring that solutions are sustainable.
The Covid-19 Manufacturing Cluster, established jointly by the HIC and PDS Engineering, during the PPE crisis last year, is a great example of how, in the face of adversity, creativity, agility and a willingness to collaborate can transcend cultural and organisational constraints and catapult a community into action.
The challenge now is to make sure we harness this to evolve, diversify, and ‘future-proof’ the region.
Supporting regional small and medium enterprises in the aftermath of Covid-19 - Professor Stefanos Mouzas and Matt Hutchinson
When the initial shock of Covid-19 had subsided, many business leaders were left wondering whether their business was still viable, whether their customers would make it through and how they could possibly overcome the financial, commercial and leadership hurdles ahead of them.
Drawing on academic research and industry experts in equal measure, Lancaster University Management School created the Covid-19 Response Programme: Recovery & Resilience for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The team has supported a broad range of Lancashire & Cumbria SMEs through three cohorts to break through the pain barrier and come out stronger, more stable and more resilient.
The programme is now in its third iteration and has supported more than 70 businesses across Lancashire and Cumbria to date, with place for another 60 planned before the end of the year.
Young Lives, Interrupted?
Resilience of young people in low- and middle-income countries during the Covid-19 pandemic - Dr Catherine Porter
Adolescence is a challenging period of life, but the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the pressure on young people trying to complete their education and enter the labour market.
Although medical research shows that the young are generally at lower risk in terms of the direct health effects of the virus, including hospitalization and death, the economic effects are likely to be long-lasting for those at the beginning of their adult life.
Many jobs have been lost, and the young have been hardest hit.
The worldwide closure of schools and higher learning institutions has no historical precedent, online learning is only accessible to some and typically excludes those with limited infrastructure or no access to the internet.
In addition, vaccine rollout is likely to be much slower in lower-income countries.
This talk presents research findings from a phone survey of just under 10,000 young people in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic crisis on young people's employment, education and mental health, and what can be done to support them.
Dr Sherry Kothari
Dr Sherry Kothari is the Director of the Health Innovation Campus, providing leadership to bring together businesses, communities, health care providers and researchers, to help address significant challenges in the North West, including health and social inequalities.

Three experts from Lancaster University discuss the impact of the pandemic on education and the lives of children.
In this Public Lecture, three experts from Lancaster University discuss the impact of the pandemic on education and the lives of children.
They explore how this situation has led many to revisit the role and purpose of schools, and revealed the challenges but also the opportunities of online learning, and discuss what measures or policies could be put into place to limit the loss of education and learning opportunities.
Searching questions about schooling
We know that Covid has acted as a magnifying glass on existing educational inequalities.
What else has it revealed?
It has laid bare some of our unquestioned assumptions about what school is for.
It has done this by showing us what is lost for children, parents and others when our young people experience a continuing absence from their schools and nurseries.
A Covid-weary teenager will tell you that schools are for keeping friends.
A Covid-weary parent may tell you that schools are for giving them respite from their children.
A Covid-weary teacher might tell you that they’ve completely lost sight of what schools are supposed to be there for – they just need to get through tomorrow.
In this talk, Professor Jo Warin discusses how the pandemic has brought about the possibility of re-imagining the purposes of schooling.
Learning from home: the barriers and opportunities
The Connecting Kids project brought together local businesses and education providers from across Lancaster and Morecambe, with Lancaster City Council and Eden Project International to respond to the emergent needs of the region's children and young people throughout the pandemic.
Global Engagement Manager and Connecting Kids Project Manager Joe Bourne will touch upon what the project team has learned about the digital divide; how non-digital provision and support is just as, if not more important than ever, and how the project took a co-designed approach to include children in the design of their learning throughout the pandemic.
What could the road from Covid-19 look like?
The current generation that is experiencing Covid is not in a position to pay these costs themselves; they are simply too much, so many of these costs have to be shifted to future generations to pay.
Are we saving ourselves at young people’s expense?
We have seen that younger people recover from Covid more quickly, and less than 5% experience Long Covid.
These are the people going to school, college, university or work.
One response to the crisis could be to apply greater restrictions to more elderly people, freeing up younger people to study and work.
In his talk, Professor Ian Walker explores how such age-related policies and other measures could help to reduce the economic and opportunity costs of Covid, particularly for the country's young people.

Lancaster University experts explore how the pandemic has affected the oncology workforce and their wellbeing, the hidden impact on child health, and how the NHS has emerged as a ‘quasi-religion’.
Invisible children: the hidden impacts of the pandemic on child health - Professor Rachel Isba
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all of us.
Whilst the disease itself generally has a less serious course in children and young people, the pandemic has had a considerable indirect impact on their health and wellbeing.
Social distancing measures and repeated lockdowns mean that children – particularly those living in difficult circumstances – have reduced access to the safety net of regular contact with education, health, and social care professionals, effectively making them invisible.
In her talk, Professor Rachel Isba discusses several research projects that showed that attendances to Children’s Emergency Departments (A&E) plummeted during the first wave, but that those children and young people who did go to hospital were more likely to get admitted; that specialist referrals for children with brain tumours were also negatively impacted during the first wave of the pandemic; and that the wider determinants of health for children have been particularly badly affected.
The COVID-NOW Project - Oncology Workforce Wellbeing and Work During COVID - Dr Claire Hardy
Since the lockdown across the UK in March 2020, the delivery of cancer care has been severely impacted.
Delays to cancer screening, surgery, treatment, and routine diagnostic work have raised grave concern for those needing these services but also for the staff trying to deliver cancer care.
In her presentation, Dr Hardy shares some of the insights gained from a collaborative research project between Lancaster University and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust exploring the experiences, perceptions and wellbeing of NHS staff involved in the delivery of cancer care across the UK.
It is the largest piece of work specifically examining this part of the NHS workforce during COVID.
The project aims to produce recommendations for cancer care staff, hospitals and policymakers to help the NHS and the patients in need of their care.
The NHS as a Sacred Value - Professor Linda Woodhead
Throughout the pandemic, it has been clear that the NHS is more than a ‘mere’ health service.
We have seen the ‘clap for carers’ initiative, and language such as ‘heroes’ and ‘angels’ used to describe healthcare workers, as well as long-established pressures on the NHS come under rightful scrutiny.
The NHS has become a symbolic focus of much that is important, even sacred, to British people, what they unite around, how they deal with suffering, reaffirm hope, and maintain cohesion – echoing the role that religion used to play.
In her presentation, Professor Linda Woodhead will explore the origins and significance of the NHS as sacred focus or ‘quasi-religion’, and consider what it means for healthcare and social futures.

This lecture presents two case studies that demonstrate quick, innovative action to two very different issues posed by the covid-19 pandemic within Criminal Justice and the Security sector.
During early 2020 all our lives were drastically altered as England and Wales followed many other countries around the world and embarked on a national lockdown in order to slow the Covid-19 infection rate.
As most of the society struggled to adjust to lockdown life, others found it easier to adapt and respond to the new challenges faced within Criminal Justice and the Security sector.
In this lecture, Dr Nicola Harding, lecturer in Criminology - Lancaster University; Tony Sales, Head of Strategic Development - We Fight Fraud; Adam Boome, Communications Director - We Fight Fraud, and Jodie Beck, Co-founder - Our Empty Chair present two case studies that demonstrate quick, innovative action to two very different issues posed by the covid-19 pandemic.
We Fight Fraud produced a pivotal online webinar just three weeks into lockdown with key warnings and preventative measures about the ‘criminal opportunity’ for fraud & financial crime offered by the pandemic.
Acting so quickly, they helped key financial institutions prevent financial crime and the significant harm faced by its victims.
Our Empty Chair is a campaign group formed to draw attention to the risks faced by prisoners during the Covid-19 pandemic from the perspective of the family members left behind at home.
As the government failed to honour their pledge to release a significant number of prisoners who did not need to be in prison, Our Empty Chair gave prisoner families a campaigning voice to show that their family members would be safer at home during this pandemic.
Dr Nicola Harding is a lecturer in Criminology at Lancaster University, she researches women and social control, critical approaches to community punishment, understanding lived experiences of the criminal justice system, alongside creative forms of qualitative research.
Tony Sales is the Head of Strategic Development and Co-founder of We Fight Fraud (www.wefightfraud.org), he is one of very few people to have ever worked at the summits of both organised crime and fraud and loss prevention.
He provides advice to some of the world’s leading brands on their fraud and loss prevention strategies.
Adam Boome is the Communications Director of We Fight Fraud, he has produced, directed and edited or developed primetime factual programmes for BBC1, 2 and 3, ITV, Channel 4 and 5, Discovery, National Geographic, TF1 amongst others.
He spent 5 years at BBC in-house productions, producing, directing and series producing often legally complex, controversial programmes in the specialist and current affairs departments.
Jodie Beck is the co-founder of Our Empty Chair (@OurEmptyChair), a grassroots collective dedicated to sharing stories about families being kept apart by prisons during the pandemic.

Talking about crime in the new world
A panel of experts from Lancaster University presents the impact of the pandemic on volunteer healthcare staff, on palliative care choices and on people with limited access to healthy food.
Click on the "show more" button below for more details on the content of the lecture and on the speakers.
One of the less recognised impacts of the pandemic has been on the contribution that volunteers make.
There are 1.5 volunteers to every paid member of staff across UK hospices, and so their contribution is central to the way that services operate.
In this first part of the lecture, Professor Catherine Walshe (Health Research, Lancaster University) draws on information from the multi-national ‘CovPall’ study to understand the impact of the pandemic on volunteering in palliative care, and how this can be addressed for the future.
If there is a point in the future when you can’t say what kind of care you want to receive, it can be helpful to share some thoughts about your preferences for treatment and care in advance.
Often only people facing a life-threatening condition consider this, but during the pandemic, we all face these issues, whether ourselves or someone we care for.
In this second part of the lecture, Professor Nancy Preston (Health Research, Lancaster University) introduces the concept of advance care planning, explores how it works, and discusses new research relating to advance care planning during the pandemic, conducted in care homes and palliative care units.
The number of people accessing support such as food banks and clubs has increased dramatically since the first lockdown.
In addition, poor health linked to diet and nutrition has also emerged as risk factors leading to a more serious illness from the virus.
Whilst the pandemic has amplified these trends, lack of access to enough, and the right kind of food, has been a fundamental problem with our current food system for many years.
In this last part of the lecture, Dr Rachel Marshall (Lancaster Environment Centre, FoodFutures, Lancaster University) and Dr Rachel Tyrrell-Smith (Lancaster City Council, FoodFutures and Lancaster District Food Poverty Alliance) discuss the links between food and health, and how our current economics and an industrial food system are driving negative public health trends.
Professor Catherine Walshe (Health Research) researches palliative and end of life care provided not only to people experiencing life-limiting illness but also in informal and professional caring contexts to provide excellent and appropriate care.
Professor Nancy Preston (Health Research) specialises in research into palliative care, symptom control and how best to support patients.
Professor Preston is involved with the local Specialist Palliative Care Network, which is a collaboration between clinicians and academics.
Dr Rachel Marshall (Lancaster Environment Centre) works on food systems and how engagement at local and national levels can support the transition to more sustainable and resilient food systems.
Dr Marshall is interested in how knowledge exchange between researchers and the wider community can deliver greater societal impact from research.
Dr Rachel Tyrrell-Smith is Public Health Project Coordinator at Lancaster City Council, working with local community stakeholders to tackle food poverty, social isolation and health inequalities.
A battle, a tsunami or a raging fire...
How are metaphors used to talk about Covid-19 and why should they be used sensitively?
For our first online Public Lecture, three Lancaster experts focus on the words and phrases used to describe or talk about the Covid-19 pandemic.
During this lecture, Professor Veronika Koller, Professor Elena Semino and William Dance will focus on the linguistics of the pandemic.
Since the beginning of the current pandemic, Covid-19 has been talked about through metaphors, for example as an enemy to be beaten, a marathon to be completed, and a tsunami overwhelming health services.
Some of these metaphors have proved controversial, however.
For example, war metaphors – such as " the battle against Covid-19" – have been criticised for potentially causing excessive anxiety; and the metaphor of the " second wave" has been described as inaccurate, because, in the words of a representative of the World Health Organization: " We are in the first wave.
There is going to be one big wave" .
In this first part of this lecture, Professors Veronika Koller and Elena Semino (Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University) discuss how metaphors have been used to communicate about different aspects of the pandemic, and why it matters that metaphors are used sensitively and effectively.
The pandemic has created a melting pot of medical, political, social and economic factors that have allowed falsehoods online to spread through all sectors of society.
A combination of mistrust, fear and people’s desire for information during a crisis has led some people to embrace conspiracy theories in a search for the “truth”.
In the second part of the lecture, William Dance (Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University) looks at how people online talk about ‘truth’ and ‘facts’ differently in relation to Covid-19, explores how disinformation has adapted to the pandemic and discusses how policymakers, educators and others can develop strategies to stop the spread of falsehoods online.
----------
Professor Veronika Koller (Linguistics and English Language) specialises in political and business discourse, health communication, and language and sexuality, with particular interests in the discourse of cancer charities and discourses around ‘Brexit’.
Professor Elena Semino (Linguistics and English Language) researches language use in communication about health and illness, medical humanities, and metaphor theory and analysis, in addition to her long-standing research interest in first-person accounts of the experiences of autism and mental illness.
William Dance is a PhD student in Linguistics and English Language, researching the use of corpus linguistics approaches to investigate deception and manipulation in online spaces.

The Lancaster Suite at Lancaster Castle is a unique seminar room, with a capacity of up to 60 people, used for academic events, teaching and training purposes.
The space is available to hire all year.
