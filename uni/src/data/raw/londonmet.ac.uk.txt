New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/applying/accreditation-of-prior-learning:
Any courses or relevant experience you gain prior to starting university could count towards your course at London Met.
This process, known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) or sometimes Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) , avoids you repeating what you've already learnt and will enable you to gain exemption from certain parts or levels of a course.
This means you could be exempt from some modules or even whole levels/years depending on the evidence or prior learning you are able to present to us.
All undergraduate and postgraduate courses at London Met are based on a Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme (CATS) whereby students accumulate credit points at the appropriate level by completing modules (15 credits or 30 credits per standard undergraduate module and 20 credits per standard postgraduate module).
These credits accumulate to give an award.
This system of quantifying learning enables credit that you have already been awarded elsewhere to count towards your course here.
Previous learning that you have gained, not on a course but through experience, can be quantified in terms of both level and volume of credit and likewise contribute to your award here.
This process of awarding credit for previous learning in order to count towards your current course is known as APL and matches your prior study or experience against the learning outcomes of the course you have applied for.
The maximum credit that can be transferred into a degree is normally two thirds of an award.
This means that at least 120 points of an undergraduate degree or 60 credits of a postgraduate degree must be achieved through modules studied at this University.
APL credits cannot be awarded for the dissertation/project element of a master's course.
If you hold a prior qualification, for example certain professional qualifications or one year at another university that may exempt you from part of your course, you can apply for Accreditation of Prior Certificated Learning.
For example you may have completed an HNC in Graphic Design, which will enable you to be awarded 120 credits towards a BA in Graphic Design and begin your studies with us in the second year of the course.
We would ask to see evidence of what you studied in the form of a transcript from your previous institution.
We would then map the credit from the course, modules or levels you have completed against the modules of the course to which you have applied.
In order to contribute credit to your new course your previous learning must be of at least the same level.
If you are awarded credit via APCL you will generally be exempted from the fees for the modules or level for which you are being awarded credit.
You should complete your UCAS application form (for a full-time undergraduate course) or University application form (for a master's course or part-time undergraduate course) with as much information as possible about your previous or current studies, including the titles of the individual subjects studied.
If you are already at the University you will need to complete a Credit Transfer Form â these are available from your school office .
Your previous institution will be able to provide you with a transcript, which is a detailed sheet of your modules and grades.
If you have undertaken significant paid or voluntary work that has resulted in learning skills or knowledge equivalent to a module you will be studying, you can apply for Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning.
For example you may have had several years working in a managerial role in business, which can count as enough credit towards a degree in Business Management to credit you for the first year and enable you to enter the course in the second year.
In these cases we would work with you to assess the credit you can claim based on your professional or voluntary experience through a process that maps your experience to the learning outcomes of the course.
Since this learning will not have been previously assessed, a claim for APEL credit involves the submission of a piece of work (such as a report or portfolio), which is assessed by a tutor and discussed with you at an interview.
If you are awarded credit via APEL you will generally have to pay about 60% of the fee for the module(s) for which you are being awarded credit.
Since an application for APEL involves the submission of a piece of work (and you may benefit from guidance in this) it is often applied for and awarded after enrolment.
However, should you wish to apply for APEL credits before enrolment you should contact our admissions team who will refer you to the relevant school APL co-ordinator.
After an initial informal assessment you will be guided through the process.

Niwa House in Southwark has been named a 2025 RIBA National Award winner, placing it among the UKâs most acclaimed new buildings.
Date: 18 August 2025
Takero Shimazaki Architects, a practice led by London Metropolitan University studio lecturer Takero Shimazaki, has received a 2025 RIBA National Award for their Niwa House in Southwark development .
The award, presented by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), is among the highest honours in UK architecture and recognises buildings that demonstrate exceptional design and contribution to the built environment.
Niwa House was one of just 20 projects selected nationwide from a pool of regional winners.
Summing up their decision, the RIBA jury praised how the design dissolves boundaries between architecture and nature:
"Carefully designed and located courtyards puncture the lower level and flood the bedrooms and circulation areas with natural light, creating lovely vignettes of gardens and sky.
The quality of light throughout the home is breathtaking.
Large full-height sliding doors and glazed walls seamlessly blend indoors and out, opening spaces to gardens, courtyards and balconies.
It is difficult to see where the building ends and the gardens begin."
Performance and precision
Despite its minimal appearance, Niwa House was delivered through complex technical coordination.
It is designed for passive performance, incorporating thermal mass, natural ventilation, high-performance glazing and effective shading.
An air-source heat pump and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery maintain thermal comfort while reducing energy use.
The architectural and engineering teams collaborated from the outset, ensuring that design intent was matched by technical integrity and accessibility.
Teaching through practice
Takero is a studio tutor on Postgraduate Architecture Unit 08 within London Metropolitan Universityâs School of Art, Architecture and Design.
The unit focuses on themes of city, weather and reuse are key concerns that are also reflected in Niwa House, which transforms a derelict urban site into a sustainable home responsive to climate and context.
London Met has a Unit-based approach to teaching where students are taught by practitioners who are actively shaping contemporary architecture, offering them direct exposure to the challenges and decisions of real-world design.
Through Unit 08, students engage with practice through tutorials, critiques and discussion of live projects.
Kaye Newman, Head of Architecture and Design, said: "We are both pleased and proud that Takero Shimazaki Architects have won this prestigious RIBA National Award.
It is a thoroughly deserved recognition of beautiful and intelligent architecture."

Date: 4 August 2025
Laszlo Budavari always dreamt of studying electronics but after 35 years of pursuing it as a hobby, he thought it was only a pipe dream.
Until one day, browsing online, a Higher Education advert popped up on social media and changed everything.
He recalls: âThe advert said âAge is just a number.
Youâre only late if you never startâ.
After some hesitation, I reached out to an agency and met someone who had a background in electronics.
He helped me choose the right subject, a Bachelorâs of Electronic Engineering and Internet of Things, and recommended London Metropolitan University.â
Laszlo was 12 and growing up in Hungary when he discovered an electronics magazine called âRadiotechnikaâ in his fatherâs drawer, that included a tutorial for building a crystal detector radio.
It became Laszloâs first ever circuit and sparked a lifelong passion.
He wasnât able to study electronics formally in Hungary, and studied in other areas including finance and accounting, but his love for electronics never went away, continuing it as a hobby for over 35 years.
Laszlo moved to the UK in 2012 to learn English and took on various jobs to transition into his new life.
10 years later, and 10 years older, studying electronics was still in the back of his mind and it was the ad that changed his life, and brought him to London Met.
This year he graduates with a First-Class Honours degree, the award for âInstitute of Engineering and Technology (IET) Best Engineering Student of the Year 2025â and will be starting his PhD research at London Met in September.
London Met prides itself on giving second chances and inspiring students that âitâs never too lateâ, and Laszlo firmly believes thatâs what the university did for him: âLondon Met truly lived up to that promise.
I felt happy, lucky, and truly at home â like I had finally found a place where I belonged.
âFrom the start, I was supported by amazing lecturers and for the first time in my education, my lecturers were not just teachers â they were friends.â
Dr.
Dion Mariyanayagam, Course Leader and Senior Lecturer for Electronics Engineering said: âLaszlo's story truly embodies the fundamental ethos of London Met, as we are a university of second chances.
Teaching Laszlo has been an absolute pleasure, and I still remember the countless hours spent in the labs.
I look forward to supervising his PhD research from September.â
One of the best parts of Laszloâs degree was feeling like he was continuing the hobby he learnt to love as a child.
He said: âI loved the hands-on learning.
It felt like continuing my hobby, but now with expert guidance.
Unlike before, when I had to research everything alone, I was now part of a community where I could share ideas, exchange knowledge, and feel truly understood.â
Chris Lane, Dean of the School of Computing and Digital Media believes Laszlo grasped every opportunity London Met provided: âAs a result, he has transformed not only himself, but also his fellow students, his lecturers and the wider university community.
Weâll feel the impact of his contribution long after he graduates.â
Laszloâs degree and study werenât without its challenges, managing daily responsibilities and deadlines, as well as the financial side, but he says it was all worth it: âIâm proud of my accomplishments.
I worked extremely hard and prioritised my studies, and it was absolutely worth it.
Achieving all Aâs and graduating with First Class Honours shows that the investment paid off.
This chapter is complete, and itâs time to celebrate!â

Date: 28 July 2025
In 2022, Anastasiia Shovkoplias, a Ukrainian teenager, was studying programming in Slovakia, on an exchange from her university in Ukraine, when Russia invaded her home country.
Three years later, sheâs graduating with honours in Journalism from London Met and will start an MA in Marketing in September and has published her very own Heavy Metal music magazine.
Anastasiiaâs dreams of becoming a writer began during the pandemic, spending a lot of time alone at home and doing some freelance writing.
She had always loved Heavy Metal, and how the music spoke of real human experience, and the darker sides of life.
Itâs the human-side that speaks to her most.
âIâm interested in human-stories, the history as well as the present, I like exploring peopleâs lives â whatâs inspired them, who they are and what theyâve been through,â she said.
No stranger to challenges herself, Anastasiia was 19 when the war in Ukraine broke out.
Studying abroad at the time, she made the difficult but necessary decision to travel to the border between Slovakia and Ukraine to meet her mum, who had left their home in Kyiv to escape the bombings.
âThere were refugee camps and charities supporting Ukrainians with necessities and buses to get to other countries.
We got a free bus to a small town in Germany, where we stayed for two months, and then my mum found the âHomes for Ukraineâ scheme in the UK so were able to go there.
From May to September 2022, we lived with a host family in Southampton, where I was able to get some work experience at the Daily Echo newspaper,â Anastasiia said.
Equipped with a passion for writing, work experience and a goal to pursue Journalism at university, Anastasiia started to search online for âBest Journalism courses in the UKâ and London Met came up.
She said: âIt was late August so admissions were closed for a lot of courses, and I was worried I wouldnât get a place anywhere.
Thankfully Clearing was open so I applied and got a place to study BA (Hons) in Journalism at London Met.â
Going to university can be daunting for anyone, but being an international student adds another challenge.
Anastassia said it took some time to get used to life in the UK, saying âAt my Ukrainian university, there were only Ukrainians, in London and at London Met, there were so many people from different countries and different backgrounds, I wasnât used to it and a bit socially awkward at first.
I donât think the pandemic helped, being on my own a lot, and then moving to another country out of nowhere.
Culture, mentality and finding that same grounding was a lot.â
But eventually, Anastasiia built up her confidence and made some great friends from all over the world, âI started talking to people, they were really patient with me, and we clicked.
I met a girl from Switzerland, from Nepal, and my best friend is from Norway,â she said.
One of the highlights for Anastasiia was her Journalism course and the support of teaching staff, âWendy and Joel, and other lecturers gave me a lot of creative freedom and didnât limit my ideas.
Iâm quite an independent person so it was great to lead with my ideas and know that if I needed help, support was there.
âTutors really went above and beyond, giving freedom, feedback and sacrificing their time for students.
The university provided me with opportunities, connections and confidence, and ultimately, I wouldnât be where I am now without it.â
And the feeling is mutual; her tutors have nothing but praise for her resilience and passion.
Associate Professor Dr Wendy Sloane, Course Leader for BA Journalism and Principal Lecturer in Creative Technologies and Digital Media, said: "Anastasiia arrived in the UK from Ukraine not really knowing what to expect - but she adapted well and very quickly found her niche.
âIn her last year, she excelled in what she enjoys most â chasing her love of music.
For her final project, she created a magazine called UnderCore, and itâs the sum of everything she adores - music, musicians, writing, business and graphic design.
She flew to several countries to interview musicians and even secured a contract to have the final product on UK newsstands.
Anastasiia set an example for others to follow - that no dream is out of reach, when you give it everything you have."
Speaking of her magazine, Anastasiia said: âItâs my baby.
The idea came out of being at a gig one day and being lucky enough to interview the band I was seeing.
It all went from there.
I developed a print magazine, gathered interviews from bands around Europe and sourced the distribution and publishing myself, all before I finished my degree.
I feel like itâs a mix of luck, motivation and my love of music which has brought me here and Iâm excited to see what happens next.â
For her magazine, Anastasiia received an A grade and won the award for Best Project in Creative Technologies and Digital Media.
After graduation, Anastasiia will begin a Masterâs in Marketing at London Met, inspired by her grandparents, who still live in Ukraine, and who she visited during winter 2024 to celebrate the new year.
âNew Year is like Christmas in Ukraine â we eat food, exchange gifts and sing carols.
There were ruined buildings and bombs going off, but after a while you get used to it, it might sound crazy, but you just get on with thingsâ, she said.
Ukraine will always be home, but London is where Anastasiia will be for now.
She said: âI miss my family and Kyiv, but Londonâs my base right now.
Iâm starting my Masterâs in September, and itâll be interesting to see what itâs like.
University is my second home and its bittersweet to graduate and finish my Bachelorâs as itâs given me so much.
Hopefully my Masterâs will do the same.
I feel less like a child now and more like an adult, and thatâs a bit scary!â
With all that Anastasiiaâs experienced in her life so far, sheâs proved being scared and doing it anyway can get you a long way, and we canât wait to see whatâs next for her.

London Met staff and students, including members of the LGBTQIA+ Staff Network, the LGBT+ Student Society, and their allies joined up to 30,000 marchers and an estimated 1 million spectators to celebrate Pride on Saturday 5 July.
Celebrations began under cool and cloudy conditions, but it wasnât long until rainbows dominated the streets.
Participants wore colourful t-shirts with âReflecting the Real Londonâ on the front, which also adorned London Metâs open top rainbow-themed Routemaster bus.
Bigger and better than last year, the Universityâs float was extremely popular with spectators, staff and students, singing and dancing all the way from Hyde Park to Whitehall, thanks to entertainment and music provided by Drag Queens Envy and DJ Milk Shandy.
âReflecting the Real Londonâ was used as a symbol of the Universityâs ongoing commitment to visibility and inclusion.
Professor Julie Hall, Vice-Chancellor for London Met, who joined staff and students in the procession, said: âPride is the perfect opportunity to celebrate and accept every individualâs uniqueness and identity, and to celebrate our wonderful LGBTQIA+ community.
âWe pride ourselves on building a community where everyone feels seen, heard and valued, and truly reflects the city it belongs to.
Being Vice-Chancellor of London Met fills me with a huge source of pride, and it was a joy and honour to lead our university in the parade!â
As the float moved through the crowds, people caught their reflections and smiled, waved, hugged, and blew kisses, taking pictures of themselves, their friends, their loved ones and even a few dogs in rainbow jackets!
We asked spectators what the âReal Londonâ means to them.
Tru, a member of the London Gay Menâs Chorus and originally from Vietnam, said: âInclusivity, diversity and a place for everyone to be their true and authentic selvesâ.
Molly said: âAnything goes, everything is OK and nothing is weirdâ.

He said in a statement: âHundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to our capital are uniting in a sea of colour and creativity â as we march in solidarity and celebration with our LGBTQI+ community.â
And the Mayor wasnât the only person to talk about solidarity, Kelly Cooper, Dean of the School of Social Sciences and Professions, who joined the march, said: âPride, to me, is about visibility, celebration, and solidarity â a time to honour the LGBTQIA+ community, while continuing to stand up for equality and inclusion.

It is a privilege to be part of a university that not only supports, but uplifts and champions LGBTQIA+ voices.â
Kelly also spoke about the atmosphere and London Metâs float: âIt was vibrant, full of energy and a true reflection of our diverse community and the values we stand for.â
This yearâs Pride theme was âThe Power of Communitiesâ, celebrating the diversity within LGBTQIA+ communities, highlighting how collective solidarity fosters positive change, resilience, and innovation, and the strength found in unity and supporting one another.
Yolieris Diaz Rivera, MA Marketing student and Student Representative who joined the float, said: âIt felt really good to represent London Met and our inclusive, accepting community.
I felt proud to promote higher education within LGBTQ+ spaces and showing that everyone has a place here.â
Community, collaboration and inclusivity is core to London Metâs values.

Northern Polytechnic Institute in Holloway Road, 1942.
Picture: London Metropolitan University Archives
In the early 70s, the Polytechnic of North London, the new name was building a name as a standout live music venue.
When John Martyn played the Polytechnic in 1970, he was already starting to reshape British folk.
His mix of acoustic guitar, jazz and improvisation made his set feel more like a glimpse of what was coming.
He went on to become one of the most influential musicians of his generation.
In 1971, Fleetwood Mac played with Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Christine McVie in the line-up, three members who would later form the core of the bandâs world-famous Rumours era.
At this point, though, the sound was very different.
The band had started to move away from their original blues roots, but guitar-driven British blues still shaped much of their set.
Slade took to the stage in 1972, all platform boots, glitter and singalong anthems â a symbol of the loud, swaggering sound of British glam at its peak.
They were one of the biggest bands in the country at the time, and their appearance helped cement the venueâs reputation.
Just a few years later, Dr.
Feelgood brought something very different.
Their sound embodied the pub-rock scene, and their working-class attitude fit with the surroundings.
Although not part of the punk movement, they were a clear influence on it.
Many who saw them play went on to form bands of their own.
As the decade continued, the Poly attracted a mix of acts who reflected the changing sound of British music.
The Jam came through with their sharp suits, The Damned delivered the chaos and speed of early punk.
There were more unexpected bookings too.
Can brought their experimental krautrock to the stage.
Thin Lizzy, Supertramp and Mott the Hoople all played, showing that the venue could draw major names while still backing bands out of the mainstream.
As documented by the Islington Pride website :
âOn the evening of Saturday 1 July 1972, the day of the first London Gay Pride protest in central London, organised by the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), the post-parade disco was held here at the Polytechnic of North London.
It promised âmusic, lights and even more surprises.â This reflects an important aspect of Britainâs LGBTQ+ history from GLF onwards: the combination of protest and celebrationâserious political action with fun, play and party, often combined in the same event.â

In the 1980s, the Polytechnic gave a platform to bands trying new things.
The Fall played a number of times, with their rough-edged songs and no-frills style.
A Certain Ratio mixed punk with funk, creating a sound that was sparse and a bit off-centre.
New Model Army played loud, serious music with a strong political streak, while Billy Bragg turned up with just his guitar and made just as much impact.
In 1982, just two years after forming from the ashes of Joy Division, New Order appeared at the Polytechnic.
They hadnât yet settled on their new sound but were beginning to experiment with the synths and drum machines that would soon define them.
That evolution would later come to fruition just a year later with their seminal hit Blue Monday .
Some of the acts leaned more towards indie pop.
Orange Juice were tuneful and clever.
The Housemartins, fronted by Paul Heaton and featuring Norman Cook (later Fatboy Slim) on bass, combined singalong melodies with thoughtful lyrics and a lot of heart.
My Bloody Valentine played in 1987, long before they were well known, with a noisy, swirling sound that stuck with people.
Other bands kept things raw.
The Screaming Blue Messiahs were fast and intense.
Pop Will Eat Itself brought a mix of guitars, electronics and samples that felt chaotic but fresh.
Among the most notorious events was a The Jesus and Mary Chain concert on 15 March 1985.
Overselling of tickets and the bandâs abrasive style led to chaos, the show lasted only about 16 minutes before concert-goers erupted in a riot, smashing the bandâs equipment and tearing down the PA system.
Roughly Â£8,000 worth of damage was done, with police called to regain control.
London Metâs Professor Emma Short attended events between 1988 and 1992 while she was a student in London: âPNL was very much seen as the cool place to be as a student for music, activism and self-expression and the Rocket was a venue right up there with some of the legendary clubs of the time, lots of us would travel across London to gigs and dance nights to be part of a vibrant scene.
I saw a few bands there, it was louder, more exciting and edgier than anywhere in North London.
It would be fascinating to hear from people who were part of this and gather their recollections so this part of our history can be sharedâ
In the 1990s, the Rocket continued to host bands just before they broke through.
Lush played in 1991, with their hazy guitar sound.
Pulp performed that same year, still a few years away from the Britpop spotlight.
The Levellers had already played in 1989, mixing folk and punk with a strong message that resonated with student crowds.
At the same time, the Rocket was becoming known for its club nights.
Club Orange was a regular fixture, popular with students and locals alike, known for its mix of house, techno and indie-dance.
It had a reputation for being loud, sweaty and a bit unpredictable.
Later in the decade, nights like Return to the Source helped introduce new electronic sounds.
The Rocket became a key venue for early drum and bass, acid house and trance, with DJs like Fabio, Grooverider, Hype, Randall and Seduction playing some of their first London sets.
These nights helped shape the underground music scene and gave space to sounds that hadnât yet broken into the mainstream.
In the mid-90s, the space was divided vertically.
The upper floor preserved the Grade II listed Great Hall for formal university events.
The lower floor became a student bar, retaining The Rocket name.
The Great Hall is mainly used for exams and official university events.
The downstairs Rocket continues as a cafÃ©-bar and study space, carrying forward more than 130 years of culture, community and student life on Holloway Road.
A Club Orange promotional flyer from 1992 Alistair Dyer, London Metâs Head of Fees and Funding, regularly attended Club Orange and other events at The Rocket in the early 1990s: âClub Orange was a real staple of London nightlife.
It had a loyal crowd, and the atmosphere was always great.
For a while, The Rocket genuinely gave places like the Electric Ballroom in Camden a run for their money as a must-visit night spot.
I think it stood out because it brought so many different scenes together.
It always felt like you were at the heart of something.â

Date: 7 July 2025
A new wave of entrepreneurial talent is emerging from London Metropolitan University this summer, with over 15 students and recent graduates taking part in the our 8-week Summer Startup programme.
Launched by our Enterprise team, the programme supports our students and recent graduates to develop their early-stage business ideas and turn them into launch-ready business ventures.
Through eight interactive, practical weekly sessions, participants receive all the tools, support, and confidence they need to turn their ideas into a reality.
With students and graduates taking part from different Schools across the university, the collaboration and energy have been electric in the first few weeks.
Final year Illustration and Animation BA student Agnieszka Albinowska told us, âThe Summer Startup programme has been a great way for me to continue building my business after winning the Peopleâs Choice award in the Big Idea Challenge 2025.â Agnieszka continues, âThe London Met Enterprise team have all been amazingly encouraging, and the sessions so far have been really fun.
Iâve learnt loads already and itâs only week 3!
Iâm so grateful for all their support and feedback as I get closer to launching my board game Sensorial Love.â Alongside their ongoing support, the Enterprise team have also arranged for six London Met alumni, who have all launched their own businesses or gone freelance, to offer mentoring to members of this summerâs Summer Startup cohort.
The programme will conclude on 13 August with a final pitch day, where our students and graduates who have taken part will have the opportunity to showcase their businesses, share the progress theyâve made during the programme, and outline their plans for the future.
From food and fashion to tech and creative services, the ideas being developed are as exciting and diverse as the students and graduates behind them.
Whether theyâre aiming to launch a side hustle or go all-in on their new business venture, Summer Startup is giving them the support, space, and spark to make it happen.
If you would like to book a one-to-one business or freelance support session with the Enterprise team or explore their other programmes for students and graduates, visit the London Met Enterprise webpage .

Are you interested in becoming a solicitor or barrister?
Or maybe you want to study law and advocacy, but not actually practise in the industry.
With so many options, itâs easy to feel lost but donât worry, weâre here to help.
We understand that finding the right law course can be difficult, especially if youâre not sure where to start.
Thatâs why weâve put together this handy guide to get you started.
We have two types of undergraduate law degrees:
In this guide, we'll explain the difference between both and the types of careers each could potentially lead to.
If you're a UK applicant wanting to study full-time starting in September, you must apply via UCAS unless otherwise specified.
If you're an international applicant wanting to study full-time, you can choose to apply via UCAS or directly to the University.
If you're applying for part-time study, you should apply directly to the University.

A lawyer is a person who practises law, either as a solicitor or a barrister.
To become a lawyer youâll need to complete a postgraduate course.
Letâs take a deeper dive into the routes you can take to become a solicitor or barrister.
To become a solicitor, youâll need an undergraduate degree, but it doesnât necessarily have to be in law or an LLB law degree.
In addition, youâll need to complete the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE), which is the new centralised assessment for anyone who wants to qualify as a solicitor.
This regime was previously known as a Legal Practice Course (LPC).
The LPC is still running presently but will only be available to students who have already started their law degree.
Unlike in previous years, if you have a non-law related undergraduate degree you donât need to undertake a Graduate Diploma in Law (e.g.
the Common Professional Exam (CPE)) in order to qualify as a solicitor.
The SQE is the new training regime for becoming a solicitor.
The previous route, known as a Legal Practice Course, will eventually be phased out.
Itâs centrally managed by educational establishment KAPLAN Higher Education.
The first SQE assessment is a 180 question multiple choice exam that covers basic law and elements of legal practice.
The second assessment is not multiple choice, instead focusing on the practical elements of law such as drafting, interviewing and advocacy.
After, before or during these assessments, youâll need to complete the practical element of the SQE.
You need to prove that you have completed two years of qualifying work experience, but this can be consultancy-based or even voluntary work with an organisation such as the Citizens Advice.
Your legal practice experience doesnât have to be two consecutive years and can be submitted as a portfolio, so long as it has been signed off by no more than four fully-qualified solicitors.
Theoretically, it should be cheaper to do the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE) as thereâs no requirement to pay for a training course.
The average price for the SQE exam is between Â£4,000 and Â£6,000.
However, itâs worth noting that without completing a training course or understanding the foundations of law, itâs unlikely that youâll pass.
Also, you must pay each time you take each exam, unlike a Legal Practice Course (LPC) where you have three chances to pass, included in the fee.
To become a barrister, youâll need an undergraduate law degree.
This doesnât necessarily have to be an LLB (Hons) law degree.
If you have a bachelorâs degree in any other subject than law, youâll need to complete a Common Professional Exam , otherwise known as a Graduate Diploma in Law.
This is typically a one-year course, if studied full-time, or longer if studied part-time.
After this, youâll need to complete a Bar Practice Course and then go on to complete a barrister apprenticeship (called a pupillage), which is the first part of work experience thatâs essential to qualifying as a barrister.
If you have an LLB undergraduate degree, you donât need to complete a Common Professional Exam or Graduate Diploma in Law.
Instead you can skip straight to completing one of the Bar Practice Courses available at various institutions.
From September 2021, the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE) is being phased in.
This is the new centralised way to qualify as a solicitor in England and Wales.
Eventually it wonât be possible to become a solicitor by completing a Legal Practice Course such as an LLM, and the only route to becoming a solicitor will be via an SQE.
For postgraduate study, you can still choose to become a solicitor via the LPC route if, on, or before 31 August 2021 you had completed, started, accepted an offer, or paid a deposit
for either:
For undergraduate study, if youâre an LLB student, you can still choose to complete the LPC and become a qualified solicitor if, on, or before 21 September 2021, you had completed, started, accepted an offer, or paid a non-refundable deposit for the LLB.
Please note, the courses must start on or before 31 Dec 2021.
If youâve already started an LLB law degree, Graduate Diploma in Law, or a training contract, donât worry.
There will be transition arrangements in place until 31 December 2032 to help you qualify as a solicitor under the current routes.
The only condition is that the courses still need to remain available.

The University welcomes students from a wide variety of backgrounds and recognises that some of its applicants may have criminal convictions.
We have a positive approach, and disclosure of a conviction does not automatically result in the withdrawal of an offer.
However, because of our obligations to protect staff and students, we expect applicants to disclose any unspent convictions relating to certain offences once you've been made an offer of a place.
If you're applying for certain courses (such as Dietetics, Counselling Psychology, Social Work, teacher training, Primary Education, Early Childhood Studies, Montessori Early Childhood Practice and Early Years Education) we expect you to disclose all unspent convictions and all spent criminal convictions that are not eligible for filtering at the earliest stage and before we make an offer.
Find out more about the University's approach to criminal convictions.

The Graduate Teacher Apprenticeship Programme is a nationally recognised, work-based route into teaching.
It offers a postgraduate-level qualification with no tuition fees and the opportunity to earn while you learn.
It is aimed primarily at candidates who have a good understanding of what it means to work in a school and have built up some experience, perhaps as a teaching assistant or in similar role.
Many candidates are working in schools already and are looking to make the next step.
You will be employed by a school on the Unqualified Teacher pay scale.
You will undertake off-the-job training, which will occupy 20% of your teaching time; this is split between face-to-face training at the University and independent training tasks in the workplace.
You will receive an induction at the University.
The course will then build on well-established and successful foundations by combining the expertise of our course tutors who are experienced classroom practitioners and teacher trainers; with a dynamic curriculum designed to cater to your needs as a teacher apprentice.
You will be encouraged to reflect upon your own practice and to critically engage with current research, policy and pedagogy, leading to a PGCE award with 60 M asterâs Level credits and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
You must be a graduate and be able to meet all of the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) entry requirements:
Please note: A non-UK citizen is usually eligible for funding if they have permission from the UK government to live in the UK (not for educational purposes), and have been ordinarily resident in the UK for at least the previous three years before the start of the apprenticeship.
You will be required to be employed as an unqualified teacher on a full-time basis and paid according to the unqualified teacher (UQT) pay scale at point one or higher.
You may be working with a school already, in which case it is possible that your school will be willing to arrange an apprenticeship training position for you.
If your employer school will consider arranging an apprenticeship place directly with London Metropolitan University, please visit our employer information page or contact apprenticeships@londonmet.ac.uk to have an initial discussion.
Alternatively, you can search for apprenticeships from the list of our partner school alliances below, all of whom offer apprenticeships via London Metropolitan University.
Please note, each of the school training alliances and federations has a slightly different recruitment policy and process.
Please look carefully at the information provided and discuss your application directly with them before applying.
Our partner schools include:
All applications must be completed on the Department for Educationâs 'Apply for teacher training' service by searching for the school.
For example, if you would like to work with Viridis Federation of Schools, you would search for that school rather than London Metropolitan University.
In most cases the apprenticeship requires a two-stage interview process, with an assessment at the school followed, for successful candidates, by an invitation to undertake the Universityâs selection process.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/courses/routes-into-teaching/essential-guide-for-your-pgce-application:
We are delighted that you are considering applying to London Metropolitan University to train to teach.
These guidelines have been written to enable you to complete your PGCE application with confidence and to avoid some of the âapplication pitfallsâ which can await the unwary candidateâ¦ Remember to check the deadline for PGCE applications to ensure you can submit yours on time.
When preparing to apply for a teacher training course, it is essential to do some research into the education world:
Research the UK education system and the role of a teacher in the present day â do not rely on your own experiences as a school-pupil!
The role of a teacher is constantly changing; it is important for you to understand how teaching works in the contexts in which you will be operating.
You will be expected to be able to talk about this in an interview situation:
Research the particular subject or phase that you are applying to teach.
What are the requirements of this particular phase or subject?
Many people assume that unless they have a degree in a particular subject, then they will not be able to train as a teacher in that subject.
This is not strictly true.
Many people would have the necessary knowledge in a particular subject to be able to train to teach it.
The requirement is for a degree, possibly in a related subject, and also to demonstrate that your subject knowledge is good enough.
You may also be able to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course (SKE), to improve your knowledge.
For example, many Secondary Maths teachers have degrees in Accountancy, Engineering, Economics or other subjects with a high maths content; they will then brush up and enhance their maths through a SKE.
For another example, many Secondary Modern Foreign Languages teachers have degrees in other subjects, but because they are a ânative speakerâ of a language, they are able to train to teach that language.
In researching your chosen phase or subject, you should also explore the aims of the subject and what methodologies are employed currently:
The âgold standardâ for teacher training courses is those which offer QTS plus PGCE (Qualified Teacher Status plus Masterâs Level Postgraduate Certificate in Education).
All of the London Met teacher training courses are QTS plus PGCE.
Make sure that you are applying for the correct route for you.
There are three main routes offered by London Metropolitan University:
Please note the following about the different routes:
All London Met routes into teaching involve training days in university combined with extensive practical experience.
Research your own eligibility for the course:
"Teachers make the education of their pupils their first concern, and are accountable for achieving the highest possible standards in work and conduct.
Teachers act with honesty and integrity, have strong subject knowledge, keep their knowledge and skills as teachers up-to-date and are self-critical.
Teachers forge positive professional relationships and work with parents in the best interests of their pupils."
-Preamble to the Teacher Standards .
Teaching is emotionally demanding work, and levels of work-related stress, anxiety and depression are higher within education than within many other occupational groups.
There is an increasing recognition that the nature of teaching and learning and the contexts in which this takes place demands what we might call âeveryday resilienceâ; that the capacity to be resilient is an important factor in teaching and teacher effectiveness over time.
Competence standards relating to teaching, personal and professional conduct have been issued by law.
The Teachersâ Standards set a clear baseline of expectations for the professional practice and conduct of teachers and define the minimum level of practice expected of teachers in England.
You are strongly encouraged to familiarise yourself with these standards before applying for this PGCE course.
Applications are all undertaken through DfE Apply .
This is a new service, introduced in October 2021.
The application window opens in October, for the following academic year.
Early applications are more likely to succeed.
In completing your form, there are a few key things to bear in mind:
All London Met interviews will ask you to undertake a presentation.
The nature of this will depend on the course you have applied for.
However, it is essential that you prepare yourself well to undertake the presentation:
There will also be a âformalâ interview.
The questions are generally very similar for each interview, in order to ensure that the process is fair.
Again, the interviewer is aiming to give you positive opportunities to demonstrate why you will make a good teacher.
In thinking about how to answer questions, prepare yourself to talk about relevant experiences or transferable skills which you have demonstrated.
The interviewer is also likely to ask you about any aspects of your application which need clarifying or which might affect your ability to take up an offer.
Please also prepare some questions yourself and be ready to ask them.
Please note: the rules, regulations and entry criteria for teacher training are set out by the DfE; London Metropolitan University has implemented an interview process which enables us to assess whether you meet these criteria, which we do as impartially as we are able.
On the London Met Routes into Teaching pages, there is a series of blogposts aimed at giving you detailed information on improving your application.
You will also be asked to undertake short Maths and English diagnostic assessments.
These are designed to ensure that you have the core competencies required of a teacher.
These assessments are mainly used to set learning targets for pre-course and during the course.
The university is responsible for ensuring your Maths and English are of an appropriate standard by the end of the course.
Maths Assessment:
This will consist of 30 questions, each worth 1 mark, divided into 3 key topic areas:
English Assessment:
This will consist of a short (500 word) hand-written discussion on an educational topic which will be given to you at the start of the assessment.
It is designed to assess your ability to:
Subject Knowledge Assessments
For courses at secondary level, in particular, you will be required to demonstrate your subject-specific knowledge.
This might be through a set of exam questions, or through discussion during the interview.
There may be some discussion during the interview as to whether you require a Subject Knowledge Enhancement course (or SKE), particularly designed for those who may be a bit rusty, or who have not studied the subject to degree level.
You should expect to hear within a few days, whether your interview has been successful.
If you have been successful, you will receive a conditional offer.
There are some conditions which everybody will have to meet, and there are some which may be specific to you or the particular course which you have applied for:
Everybody will need to complete the following:
Some people will also need to supply:
You will need to accept the conditional offer and then to meet all of the conditions before you are able to enrol.
If you have not met the conditions, you will not hear about enrolment and you will not be able to enrol.
As a training provider, we have a responsibility to ensure that trainees have the health and physical capacity to teach and will not put children and young people at risk of harm.
The activities that a teacher must be able to perform are set out in the Education (Health Standards) (England) Regulations 2003.
Under these Regulations, we are responsible for ensuring that only trainees who have the capacity to teach remain on the programme.
Successful applicants offered a place on an ITE programme will be asked to complete a fitness questionnaire prior to commencing the programme.
This will be assessed by our Occupational Health team.
You may be asked to provide further information in a meeting with the assessor, or a letter from your GP or specialist.
Applicants should at an early stage disclose any disability that may have implications for fitness to teach and contact our Disabilities and Dyslexia Service team for professional advice where necessary.
People with disabilities or chronic illnesses may have the capacity to teach, just as those without disabilities or medical conditions may be unsuitable to teach.
Any assessment of individual is fit to teach will take account any reasonable adjustments that could be made to assist the applicant in working in the teaching profession.
Our research demonstrates that where early disclosure occurs, disabilities are less likely to have a negative impact on the training course.
If you are unsuccessful at interview, you will receive a letter giving an explanation as to why it is felt that you are not yet ready to train to teach.
You will be given some suggestions for areas that the interviewer feels would help you to progress towards a successful application in the future.
Read about our admissions process and policy , including guidance on how to make a complaint.
The complaints procedure can be followed if, for example, you're concerned there's been an administrative error, if you believe you've been treated unfairly because of bias or prejudice, or if there are circumstances unknown to the University that you feel might have affected the decision.

We want to make your application to London Met as stress free as possible.
That's why we complied a list of the most frequently asked questions to help you navigate through the process.
You can search on our routes into teaching page which will give you a great idea of the options available to you.
You can apply throughout the year from October.
The normal cut off point for applications is July, after that applications would be considered as âlate applicationsâ if there are still places available.
Early application is highly recommended as courses may fill up before July; many candidates will also need to complete SKE or other conditions so should give themselves time to complete these.
The most popular route into teaching is the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) pathway, which combines school placements (120 days) with studying education theory at university.
Alternatively, you can take a Graduate Apprenticeship which is a salaried route into teaching, but you will already have to work in a school as a unqualified teacher or need to have found a school willing to support you.
This is a non-salaried, employment-based route into gaining a Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
You apply to a school but the course is delivered by the university in conjunction with the school.
This route is almost identical to the Universityâs own âcoreâ PGCE, though you would have a slightly closer link with the school and would complete placements there.
To teach at a further education college you will need a degree in the subject you wish to teach, however you do not need a PGCE qualification.
If you are considering working in sixth form you will probably need to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
Yes, PGCE is an internationally and highly recognised qualification.
However, âQTS onlyâ routes are rarely recognised abroad (all of the LMU training routes offer QTS plus PGCE).
If you are applying for a training bursary, please be aware that you would only be eligible for this if you are committed to teaching in England on completion of your training.
Yes, teachers with disabilities make important contributions both in the learning of their students as well as culture of the school they work in.

Providers have a responsibility to ensure that trainees have the health and physical capacity to train to teach and will not put children and young people at risk of harm.
Providers are responsible for ensuring that only trainees who have the capacity to teach remain on the programme.
Being fit to teach means that you meet the physical and mental fitness requirements to perform teaching duties without putting children and young people at risk, and that's the case for all subject pathways, not just physical education!
Teaching is a stressful and hard working profession and it is important that trainees are aware of this and have the resilience, both mentally and physically, to cope with a job in teaching.
All applicants are required to complete a Fitness to Teach questionnaire and may have to demonstrate that they âhave the health and physical capacity to train to teach and will not put children and young people at risk of harmâ.

Please check the entry criteria on the course page for the subject you are applying to study as each route has its own specific requirements.
All routes into teaching require you to have a university degree.
For routes into primary teaching, there is no specific degree required.
For secondary routes, most (but not all) candidates will have a degree relating to their subject area; if your degree is not in the subject area, you would need to demonstrate strong subject knowledge.
Yes, you will need a C/4 or above (or equivalent) in English and Maths as an essential requirement for all pathways.
For primary and early years PGCEs you also need to have a pass in a GCSE in Science, Maths and English.
Y ou will need to make sure you have the GCSEs and certificates in place before you can take up a place on a PGCE programme.

This is not a requirement but is highly recommended.
You will need to demonstrate commitment to the profession and an understanding of it.
You could study towards a postgraduate qualification in teaching (PGCE), or take the Graduate Apprenticeship.
The latter option will require you to get the school youâre teaching at to support you through the apprenticeship, or to  apply for one of our partner apprenticeships in a different school.
You may also be suitable for the Assessment Only route if you already hold a degree.
For the AO route you need to have at least 2 years whole classroom experience across the age range for your phase, and experience teaching in at least two schools

You will not be able to enrol if you have not met all the conditions.
You may apply again next year, but you will have to address the conditions and advice given to you in the first interview.
In order to defer your place you would need to have met all your entry requirements and have an unconditional offer.
If the offer is still conditional, you would need to apply again when the recruitment cycle re-opens in October.
At that point, if the recruitment processes have not changed, you may be exempt from repeating those parts of the interview that you have already completed successfully.
An academic reference and a professional reference are the best combination, but not from a family or friend.
If you have worked in a school or any other place of work, it is useful if the professional reference comes from a line manager in that workplace.

An interview with PGCE Modern Foreign Languages (German and French) Secondary and College Trainee Teacher Josef Al-Raheme, who also somehow finds time to moonlight as a Citizens Advice legal adviser whilst polishing up his chess and piloting skills.
I have a diverse background.
I am originally from Iraq and I was born and raised in Germany, a beautiful country that instilled in me a love for languages and a keen sense of global perspective.
In 2013, I made a significant move and relocated to London, a city that's both historically rich and pulsating with modern energy.
Upon settling in London, I undertook my GCSEs and later, my A-Level qualifications.
My passion for understanding societal structures and justice led me to pursue a law degree at City, University of London.
This period of my life was particularly transformative.
Not only did I immerse myself in the intricacies of the legal system, but I also had the honour of being offered a scholarship for academic excellence, a testament to the hard work and dedication I invested in my studies.
In 2023, I graduated, armed with a wealth of knowledge and a renewed sense of purpose.
As of now, I hold both German and British nationalities, and I deeply value the unique perspectives that each part of my heritage brings to my identity.
However, my academic journey didn't end there.
My German roots and my love for languages beckoned me to contribute to the realm of education.
I decided to undertake a PGCE in Modern Foreign Languages, focusing on German and French.
When choosing where to continue this next phase of my educational journey, London Metropolitan University stood out.
Given its reputation for fostering a diverse and supportive learning environment and its emphasis on practical, real-world teaching experiences, it felt like the perfect fit.
In essence, my journey from Germany to London and from law to teaching has been guided by a blend of personal heritage, academic passions and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the lives of future generations.
London Met, with its unique offerings and ethos, seemed like the ideal place to further this mission.
The decision to study in London was driven largely by the unparalleled academic resources and opportunities available in this vibrant city.
London is home to a myriad of world-renowned institutions, libraries, and research centres, making it an academic hub thatâs teeming with knowledge and learning opportunities.
The cityâs rich tapestry of cultures and its status as a global metropolis mean that the learning extends far beyond the classroom, offering insights into diverse world views and global perspectives.
In addition to the academic resources, Londonâs dynamic and inclusive environment was a significant draw.
The cityâs unique blend of historical richness and modern innovation provides a stimulating backdrop to academic pursuit, offering countless opportunities for exploration, cultural enrichment and personal growth.
The cityâs reputation for academic excellence, combined with its cultural diversity and its abundance of learning resources, made it the ideal place for me to pursue my academic journey and broaden my horizons.
The energy of London â its people, its culture, its institutions â it all converges to create a learning environment that is both enriching and inspiring.
My favourite part of the course so far has been the opportunity to further enhance my proficiency in French.
Diving deeper into the language has been both challenging and rewarding, as I navigate the nuances and intricacies of its linguistic landscape.
However, beyond language acquisition, what truly stands out to me is the focus on the pedagogical aspect of the course.
Learning the skills and methodologies of becoming an effective teacher has been an enlightening experience.
It's not just about conveying knowledge, but understanding how students learn, adapting teaching strategies to cater to diverse learning needs, and creating an inclusive and stimulating classroom environment.
This blend of language mastery and educational techniques ensures that when I step into a classroom as a teacher, I'll be well-equipped to inspire and educate the next generation.
One of the most challenging aspects of being a student has been striking the right balance between academic pursuits, personal development, and social life.
The academic rigour and demands of the curriculum often require long hours of study, research, and preparation.
While this is invigorating in its own right, it can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when deadlines converge.
Lastly, while university life offers abundant opportunities for socialisation, finding the right balance between social engagements and academic commitments is an ongoing challenge.
It's a constant effort to ensure that while Iâm making the most of the vibrant social scene, Iâm also staying on top of my academic responsibilities.
In essence, the student journey, while incredibly rewarding, is a tapestry of challenges and triumphs, each contributing to personal and academic growth.
The professors and teachers at London Metropolitan University have been instrumental in shaping my academic journey.
They bring a unique blend of expertise, passion and dedication to the classroom, which has greatly enriched my learning experience.
In particular, I'd like to highlight Amanda Powling .
Her support has been invaluable to me.
Not only is she a phenomenal educator, seamlessly blending theoretical knowledge with practical insights, but she also genuinely cares about her students.
It's evident in the way she teaches and interacts with us.
With Dr Powling, it's not just about disseminating information; it's about ensuring we truly understand, internalise, and can apply what we've learned.
Her commitment to student success, both inside and outside the classroom, has left a lasting impact on me.
Overall, I feel truly fortunate to have been under the guidance of such dedicated educators.
Their support, coupled with their ability to make complex topics accessible and engaging, has made my academic journey both rewarding and inspiring.
In essence, I am driven by a deep-seated desire to better myself and to continuously seek challenges that push the boundaries of what I thought possible.
Whether it's in the courtroom, the classroom, the skies or over a chessboard, I am propelled forward by an innate passion to make a meaningful impact and live a life filled with purpose and discovery.
What I'm most proud of in my life revolves around my commitment to education and personal development.
Earning my law degree from City, University of London stands out as a significant achievement, given the rigorous academic challenges and the depth of understanding required in this field.
However, beyond academia, I'm immensely proud of my work at Citizens Advice as a legal adviser.
Every pro bono case I undertake isn't just about legal representation; it's about standing up for those who might not have the means to stand up for themselves.
Knowing that I've been able to make a positive impact in areas like welfare benefits, housing law, employment law, and debt management brings me a profound sense of accomplishment and purpose.
Outside of the professional realm, pursuing my Private Pilot Licence and my passion for chess are achievements that reflect my multifaceted interests.
Chess, in particular, is a testament to my dedication, strategic mindset, and competitive spirit.
All these facets of my life, when combined, paint a picture of dedication, service, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in varied domains.
The synergy of my academic, professional, and personal achievements is what I'm genuinely proud of, as they reflect not just what I do, but who I am.
My favourite spot within the University has to be the courtyard.
It's this expansive area that serves as a serene escape from the bustling academic life.
What I particularly love about it is the opportunity it provides to sit down, take in some fresh air, and enjoy the weather, especially on those rare sunny days in London.
It's more than just a relaxation spot; itâs also a social hub.
I've had countless conversations, both light-hearted and profound, with friends and peers there.
It's where we come to take a break from our studies, share our experiences, or simply enjoy the ambiance of the campus.
The courtyard, for me, symbolises the perfect blend of relaxation, reflection and camaraderie â making it an invaluable part of my university experience.
Yes, I am working while studying.
I'm currently employed at Citizens Advice as a legal adviser.
This role isn't just a job for me; it's a manifestation of my commitment to ensuring everyone has access to justice, regardless of their financial situation.
I undertake pro bono cases, offering free legal assistance to individuals who otherwise might not be able to afford such services.
The areas I specialise in are welfare benefits, housing law, employment law, and debt management.
Each day, I'm confronted with the real-world implications of legal issues, seeing first-hand how they impact people's lives.
It's both challenging and immensely rewarding.
While balancing work with my studies can be demanding, the experiences and insights I gain from my role at Citizens Advice are invaluable.
It not only complements my academic journey but also reinforces my belief in the transformative power of legal advocacy.
Through my work, I aim to make a tangible difference in the community, ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their economic status, has a voice and the necessary legal support.
Outside of my academic pursuits at university, I have a deep-seated passion for flying.
Currently, I am working towards obtaining my Private Pilot Licence.
The thrill of being airborne, the intricate mechanics of operating an aircraft, and the freedom of soaring through the skies exhilarate me.
This enthusiasm isn't just about the physical act of flying; it also embodies my belief in pushing boundaries, embracing challenges, and literally reaching for new horizons.
Another passion of mine is chess.
I regularly compete in chess games, and it has become more than just a hobby for me.

S/he then explains how they intend to investigate some aspect of the unknown (research design or methodology).
This is followed by conclusions and a list of references.
The proposal should be organised as explained below.
Follow the format presented here using the same main headings, and in the same order as shown here.
All sections must be completed.
Suggested word count is up to 3,000 (less for computing and science subjects).
Your proposal should indicate:
Specify as clearly as possible the focus of your research, written as an aim and subordinate objectives or as one or more research questions.
Think of a research aim as an orange and the objectives as the segments.
You would not try to put the whole orange in your mouth.
Rather you would divide the orange into segments and eat each segment.
In a similar way think of the research aim as a broad statement, which you need to divide into segments (subordinate objectives) in order to carry out the study.
If your research is driven by policy debates, describe the specific aspects of these debates on which your research will focus.
If your research is driven by theoretical debates, or apparent omissions or inconsistencies in the existing literature (theoretical or empirical), what aspects of these debates will you address?
If your research focus is on the nature of practice in some field (eg business management or science research) then what aspects of practice will you explore (eg managerial behaviour or scientific discovery?).
In thinking about aim and objectives it may be useful to keep in mind the purpose of most research.
Research is normally undertaken for differing (and sometimes overlapping) intellectual reasons:
Aims
Once aims have been established, the next task is to formulate the objectives.
Generally, a project should have no more than one or two aim statements, and should include a number of objectives consistent with the aim(s).
Objectives
Aims and objectives should not:
Example research questions and potential hypotheses, these need to be testable, for example:
Word count: 200â300
Following the stated aim or research question, you must review the published literature on your topic.
Here you show what has already been proposed, claimed, or established.
The literature you review should normally comprise theoretical and empirical studies, policy and industry reports and articles published in the quality periodicals and newspapers.
Summarise and evaluate the usefulness of these previous studies in relation to your stated aim or research question.
It is important that you show awareness of the most important and relevant theories, models, empirical studies and methodologies.
A good literature review will compare and contrast theories and empirical results, pointing out agreement and disagreement, gaps and overlaps of argument.
A poor literature review often simply provides summarised lists of theories and empirical studies, with little or no attempt to compare, contrast or evaluate these theories and empirical studies.
Make clear how well these published studies address your research focus, by examining the extent to which they provide insight to, or answer, each of your research objectives or questions.
The identification of omissions or weaknesses in the published literature leads to the opportunity and justification for your study.
In addition, identifying weaknesses and omissions within the published knowledge base represents your contribution to knowledge: a contribution that you will seek to elaborate and establish more firmly through carrying out your own empirical research.
Depending on your intended research design (next step) you may convert the identified weaknesses and omissions into hypotheses.
A hypothesis is a simple but testable statement that proposes that one factor (call it A) causes another factor (call it B) to behave in a certain way.
Word count: 600-750
Following your literature review, you should outline how you plan to go about collecting empirical data that will build the understanding required to fulfil your research aim, or test the hypotheses you have developed from your review of the literature.
Describe how you will carry out your study, referring to frameworks and concepts found in the research methods literature.
Specifically this section must describe your overall approach and specific methods/techniques of collecting data .
You must also explain how you will analyse the data collected (methods/techniques of data analysis), what measures you are taking to ensure the quality of your research design (research quality issues), and show an awareness of ethical considerations around academic research (research ethics issues).
The proposal requires that you have made firm arrangements with your target (eg: the organisation or community you propose to study or work with) for access to data prior to writing the proposal, rather than describing that you plan to seek access to your target after the proposal is written.
Word count: 500â700 words
Summarise your proposal, including your potential contribution to knowledge.
In thinking about what could be your contribution to knowledge, consider:
Making a "significant contribution" means adding to existing knowledge or to the discourse around a phenomenon.
Research work is part of an ongoing discourse among many researchers, each critiquing the availÂ­able evidence and providing fresh argument and evidence that contributes to knowledge and understanding.
Research involves questioning the accepted wisdom (the obvious), examining and analysing phenomena from a different perspective, and investigated through a variety of techniques.
Research seeks to create new understanding of the world, using new ideas and approaches, rather than describing it using existing frames and tools.
As more evidence is presented, existing explanations are re-evaluated.
In this way knowledge is constantly reconfirmed, elaborated, revised, or overturned.
Knowledge claims may be small and still contribute to the discourse.
Word count: 200 â 250 words

Distance learning involves spending part of each year at London Met and part of the year away from the University, probably in your country of residence.
Supervisors and students keep in regular contact through face-to-face meetings as well as through email and other electronic means.
A PhD is unlike an undergraduate or taught Masters degree.
For an MPhil/PhD, the student must conduct original, independent research.
How this is done will depend on the area of research and the methods agreed with the supervisors.
Some of the research and employability skills training may be undertaken on-line.
London Met offers a wide range of subject areas.
A good place to start looking is to consult the Research centres, units and institutes page to find out about the research being undertaken and at London Met.
Through our supervisor search, you can contact staff members whose research interests are complementary to yours.
The MPhil and the PhD are both research degrees.
They are awarded by the University after the successful presentation of a thesis based on an original piece of research completed under the supervision of University staff.
Students generally register for an MPhil degree and then apply to transfer to a PhD.
To obtain a PhD, the candidate is expected to investigate a topic and make an original contribution to knowledge.
Research at MPhil level should represent an extension of existing knowledge, although the demands of originality and sustained enquiry are less than those for a PhD.
A full-time student normally reaches the standard for MPhil within two years of registration and for PhD within three years.
The minimum and maximum periods of registration are as follows:
MPhil
Full-time:
Part-time:
PhD (via transfer from MPhil registration and including the period of MPhil registration)

When preparing to apply for teacher training, itâs essential that you research teaching, the education system and all the different routes into teaching.
That said, we know thereâs a lot of information to navigate so hereâs or quick guide to help you break down the necessary prep into three different areas:
A lot of things could have changed since you were at school, so itâs really important to look into what the current education system is like and understand the challenges teachers are facing.
This will help you make an informed decision about whether you think teaching is the right career for you.
Find out what the requirements are for the subject or Key Stage youâd like to teach.
Lots of people assume that unless they have a degree in a particular subject, they wouldnât be able to teach it.
But thatâs not the case.
You may have a degree in a similar subject or have covered enough similar content to demonstrate that you have enough subject knowledge.
There are also Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses that you can undertake to improve this.
While researching your chosen subject or Key Stage, also explore the topics covered and what the aims are.
You can look at the national curriculum and also research how the subject or Key Stage is assessed eg phonic exams, SATs, GCSEs, A Levels, plus internal school and teacher assessments.
There are lots of different ways that you can become a teacher and all routes give a minimum of 120 days of school experience.
The âgold standardâ of options is a course that offers QTS and PGCE, which is Qualified Teacher Status and a Masterâs level Postgraduate Certificate in Education.
All of our training courses offer QTS plus PGCE and combine training days in the University with extensive practical experience.
Itâs important that you choose the route thatâs right for you.
This is the most popular route into teaching.
Youâll experience university lectures, assessments and receive support and guidance from tutors and lecturers.

Youâll be employed by the school and work as a teacher for up to 80 per cent of your time, with the other 20 per cent set aside for training.
Places on these apprenticeships are salaried and in short supply.
Usually these are taken by candidates who already have experience of working in schools because schools offering these opportunities will want to make sure they employ someone who can hit the ground running.
Almost identical to a university-led PGCE, but youâll be linked more closely to a specific school partnership or location.
This course would be the most appropriate option if you need to work in a specific location or school.
Itâs also important that you research your eligibility for a course.

If youâre applying to train as a teacher youâll be required to write a personal statement as part of your application.
Take your time writing your personal statement.
Itâs your first chance to make a good impression so it's well worth investing time to develop a clear structure and style of writing.
Itâs a good idea to proofread your statement thoroughly and get others to read through and check for typos, grammatical errors, style, and tone.
The personal statement is crucial to your PGCE application; it is used primarily to decide whether to invite you for an interview.
A poorly written personal statement could end your teaching career before it has started!
This is your chance to demonstrate what you have to offer as a teacher.
You should also explain why you want to teach a particular subject or age range, and how your skills and experience will help you become a great teacher.

It should also show that you understand the education system, what challenges teachers face and that youâre engaged with issues around education.
If youâve not taught before, think about any other things youâve done that might demonstrate the skills youâll need to be a teacher (your transferable skills).
Although itâs a good place to expand on your skills and experience, this shouldnât be the main focus of your personal statement as the rest of the application will showcase this.
Up to 400 words.
Remember to not repeat anything you have already said in section 1!
If youâre writing a personal statement for secondary teacher training, use this section to describe your knowledge and experience of the subjects youâve chosen.

Apprenticeships are a fantastic way to start or enhance a career.
London Met is delighted to currently offer the Level 6 Teacher Apprenticeship and our Architect Apprenticeship (Level 7) (RIBA Part 2 and Part 3) - MArch as part of our learning portfolio.
Apprenticeships enable you to be employed full time, being paid, whilst being released to learn and qualify in your occupational area.
What is even better is that your employer would fully fund the cost of your training through their Apprenticeship Levy fund.
Apprenticeships have to be commissioned by your employer.
The first step, therefore, is to speak to your line manager or human resources lead to discuss the apprenticeship and how this links to your role and career progression.
Your employer would need to contact London Met to discuss the course particulars.
Once this is all agreed, you would be asked to make an application to London Met for the apprenticeship.
The process and documentation will all be shared with you and your employer, and the apprenticeship team will support you through the process.
If you're not currently employed but are keen to develop your career through a qualification in your chosen area, London Met would be delighted to discuss other courses that may be suitable.
Please feel free to browse our courses or contact our enquiries team .
London Met is delighted to be delivering the following apprenticeships:
If you're interested in undertaking an apprenticeship, please get in touch using the form below.
An apprenticeship is a training course delivered by a registered provider that is undertaken whilst you're working.
You therefore must be employed, with an employment contract, to be an apprentice.
Apprenticeship courses, known as apprenticeship standards, range from Level 2 (equivalent to GCSE level) to Level 7 (master's level).
Each standard has been developed by industry employer groups to determine the skills they need within their industry area.
The standard sets out the knowledge, skills and behaviours that must be achieved during the course in order to pass the apprenticeship.
An apprenticeship provider will deliver the training for your course, which will include all teaching, learning, support and guidance to meet the standard.
To pass the apprenticeship, every apprentice must undertake an End Point Assessment (EPA).
This is a final assessment at the end of the course that will determine whether you have met the requirements.
This is nearly always undertaken by a third party provider, not your training provider.
To view what apprenticeship standards are available nationally you can visit the Institute for Apprenticeships website .
At London Met, we take our obligation to guarantee the security of our students extremely seriously.

In this module we will explores and seek to understand popular music with reference to its history, the local and global cultures that it has been produced in, and some critical theories that help to explain it.
We will consider the history of popular music since the mid-twentieth century as well as discrete periods of its development - such as 1955-60, 1975-80 and the early 2000s - and the types of music that emerged and were popular during them, e.g.
rock n’ roll, hip-hop, punk and EDM.
Different forms and phases of pop music will be thought about historically and factually, as well as in terms of the socio-cultural and socio-economic circumstances that accompanied them and that informed their musical and cultural features and styles.
Theories that develop and deepen an understanding of all these aspects of pop music will be drawn on.
We will, for example, examine both rock and rap with reference to theories of race and ethnicity, sociological theories and feminist theories.
Non-Western as well as Western music forms, styles, cultures and subcultures will also be considered, including afrobeat, jungle, rai, highlife, reggae and K-pop.
Less commercial or fashionable Western forms like folk, country and independent and experimental music will be considered too.
Yet other theories will be applied to some or all of the above forms and will include music theory, genre theory, social and political theory, psychoanalysis and historical materialism.
Particular attention will be paid to certain historical and socio-cultural issues that are apparent and significant in contemporary pop music such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality and social class.
We will also consider some or all of the following important aspects of popular music and culture: globalisation, the construction of star personas and celebrity, the nature of audiences (and fans and subcultures), economic and cultural convergence and integration and technological (especially digital) innovation and change, especially its effect on musical creation and distribution (streaming, home studios, social media, etc).

If youâre worried about results day, these feelings of comparison can be amplified, so itâs a good idea to turn off your social media notifications or pause your apps.

Spend time with friends and family, get a summer job or keep your mind busy with books or podcasts.

Self-care allows you to take time to prioritise your own wellbeing.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/clearing/what-is-clearing:
If youâre interested in going to university this autumn, itâs useful to be aware of Clearing (often called UCAS Clearing).
You may already have your university place sorted or you may have only just started thinking about going to university â but whatever your situation, you could find yourself needing Clearing.
So, what is Clearing?
Clearing is a way that universities fill places on their courses as they get closer to the start of the new academic year.
Clearing generally opens in the first week of July and it can be a useful service if you want to go to university but find yourself in one of the following scenarios:
Clearing Plus is a UCAS service available to you if:
UCAS will look at your original choices, as well as your grades and qualifications, and seek to match you with a course and university that has places available through Clearing.
You will only be shown matches that you meet the entry requirements for.
If youâre eligible for Clearing Plus, youâll be able to view your matches in your UCAS Hub .
In your UCAS Hub, you will be able to indicate whether youâre interested in any of the courses/universities that you have been matched with.
If you indicate youâre interested, you will usually receive a call from that university (or universities if youâve said youâre interested in more than one) â they are likely to ask you a few questions about why you think youâll be a good fit for the course and may then offer you a place.
Of course, you can also do your own research and find courses that you believe are a good match.
UCAS Clearing Plus is simply trying to save you time by doing that research for you.
If youâre looking to do your own research, why not take a look at our five steps for Clearing success ?
In most cases, anyone can apply to university during the Clearing period.
However, some application routes are only open to UK students or EU students with settled or pre-settled status.
At London Met, you should only apply through our Clearing hotline or via our quick online Clearing application form if youâre applying for a full-time undergraduate course and youâre either from the UK or youâre from the EU and have settled or pre-settled status.
Providing the international application deadline hasnât passed, if youâre an overseas student, you can still apply during this period but you need to apply in a slightly different way â simply browse the Clearing courses available and apply from your chosen course page.
This is also the application route for all part-time courses, regardless of whether youâre from the UK, EU or outside of the EU.
Please note that the application deadline for international students always happens much earlier than the end of the Clearing period.
If applying directly to a university through Clearing, make sure you have your personal details ready â this includes personal details, your contact information and details of any qualifications you hold.
If you know which course you want to apply for, thatâs great, but remember, if calling a universityâs Clearing hotline, one of their advisers should also be able to provide guidance to help you in your decision-making.
Remember, thousands of people go through this process every year so it doesnât need to be daunting.
You may find it useful to hear about other studentsâ experiences of Clearing â find out from Josh what Clearing’s like .
It isnât possible to predict what courses will or wonât be available through Clearing as this can vary and can often depend on the university â but here at London Met, we usually have a wide range of Clearing courses available .
Hopefully you now have a better idea of what Clearing is, who itâs for and when itâs available â plus hopefully youâve picked up a few extra Clearing tips along the way.
We wish everyone going through the Clearing process this year the best of luck.

As I near the end of my Journalism degree I feel that now is the best time for me to reflect.
Not only to reflect on whatâs been a fun journey, but also a learning curve.
Hopefully my journey can inspire and allow you to take something away from it!
On 3 October 2017, I walked through the entrance of the Holloway campus for a 10am class.
I had no idea what my tenure at London Met would entail, but what was to follow provided me with fun, friends for life, opportunities, and most of all, life lessons.
On the same day as my first lesson, I immediately headed for the Studentsâ Union (SU), as I was eager to join the media team, Verve.
Before I knew it, not only was I hosting my own radio show but also writing for the magazine, and then a few months later working in the SU.
I owe a lot to the staff at the Studentsâ Union past and present, as they made me feel welcome.
Being a part of Verve Media in my first year was the first step I took to becoming comfortable at London Met.
Academically, as the year progressed, so did my work.
I was getting to grips with everything, thanks to the journalism department staff who gave me a confidence boost and the self-belief that was much needed.
In the summer of my final year, I was fortunate enough to be able to be part of an advertisement for the University.
Whilst it wasn't Hollywood, I had always wanted to feature in an advert, so this was a cool experience.
What awaited me in my second year was nothing short of memorable.
Both academically and outside lessons, this year was about to provide me with opportunities I would never have thought would fall my way.
In June 2018, I was appointed Editor-in-Chief of Verve Magazine .
Growing up being the editor of a magazine was on my ever-growing list.
To be able to tick that off, was something I will not ever forget.
In freshersâ week of that year (September) my first edition of Verve Magazine was published and still to this day it holds a lot of sentimental value to me; it always will.
Continuing my work with the SU, enjoying every moment and making new friends all the time, it truly made my second year at London Met my favourite year.
It seemed like only yesterday the SU took a chance on a young lad with little experience, but through my own work, it paid off.
Once again, I was part of an advert for the journalism course, something I thoroughly enjoyed doing.
In April 2019, I spent two weeks working at Sky News and Sky Sports News.
Thanks to the head journalism lecturer Wendy Sloane, I was provided with an amazing experience that I will never forget.
This too was something I had dreamed of, and to be able to tick that off my list was a proud moment.
Another year, another freshersâ, but it would be my final one.
The year was heavy but that was much expected as it was the final push in my degree and three years at London Met.
Prior to the year beginning, I joined the social media team as an ambassador with several other students.
I would highly recommend joining them!
It is a lot of fun, creativity, working with great people â and itâs paid!
The marketing team provided me with great opportunities to help them, which was something I am eternally grateful for and learned a lot from.
Working on my final project has been a lot of fun, as it allowed me to pick my topic of choice and get creative with it.
Despite the tough moments of loads of assignments and deadlines, it has taught me to be more consistent with my work, especially with added pressure.
In what has been an amazing journey at London Met, not only have I made friends and memories for life, but I have also been able to grow from a lost 19-year-old boy into a man, ready for anything.
Always look forward and not behind, for the reward you seek is ahead of you.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/blogs/student-blogs/the-benefits-of-studying-at-a-multicultural-university:
Since joining London Met, Iâve been surrounded by and interacting with a large number of students with different stories and from various cultural backgrounds.
Date: 17 September 2019
My journey as a student at London Metropolitan University began two years ago when I enrolled on the Art and Design Extended Degree (now Art and Design (including foundation year) BA ).
Being in a multicultural environment has really helped me to adapt, fit in and integrate into university life.
Iâve seen people who are going through what I've experienced, people who have left their motherlands behind, living away from their friends and family and I have felt that they understood what Iâm feeling.
I have learnt a lot about London from British students too â I've learnt about English history, their slang and also their habits.
It has felt like Iâve been exploring the world and experiencing its variety of cultures without travelling.
Iâve tried different types of food and learnt about different cuisines.
I have seen how people pray, hold different beliefs and the many different ways they practice religion.
Iâve been able to learn about the different journeys people have taken in order to come to university.
I have seen people not giving up on education while having children to raise.
I have been surrounded by people who finished school and came straight to university, but also by mature students who decided to wait until later years to re-enter education.
I have been surrounded by people with great motivation and some people who lack motivation.
Iâve also been able to see how people interpret tasks in different ways.
I've felt inspired.
The diversity of people and being in such a vibrant environment has helped me to connect my own pieces, understand myself better and relate to different habits and cultures.
I became more tolerant and inclusive with a large variety of people.
I became more open-minded.
I have added places to see on my travel list.
I have met people who give me a reason to get on a plane.
Another thing that I really liked and that makes my university life easier is the variety of teachers.
We have teachers from all over the world and I think that this really helps students to integrate more and create a better relationship between teachers and students, which helps us do better and achieve more.
I think this is important in a university because it removes any cultural barriers between the students and staff.
The cultural diversity at London Metropolitan University gives my degree even more value to me, knowing that I will always feel included and that I can always find someone that will understand and support me.
I feel like this University represents London with its variety of people, cultures and backgrounds.
It is like a home far away from home to its students, who get to collect and give a part of their story to other people.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/blogs/student-blogs/being-accepted-at-london-met-as-part-of-the-lgbtqia-community:
Date: 14 November 2019
My name is Nils and I self-define as homosexual.
I came out at the age of 15 and visited a school at this time where I wasnât quite accepted â I was even bullied â because of my sexuality.
Sadly, some of my former teachers werenât well educated about the topic of LGBTQIA+ and therefore didnât step in to help.
I think that part of the problem was that they were uncomfortable with my openness about the topic.
As I didnât feel accepted because of my sexuality, I joined a LGBTQIA+ association shortly after coming out.
The association advocated for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community and fought for equality in the area that I lived in.
They also held small yearly events that were considered part of the pride parades of northern Germany.
Working together with such great and proud people of the LGBTQIA+ community really helped me to fully embrace my sexuality and also develop a sense of pride for it.
Unfortunately, the city I lived in was in what was generally quite a right oriented part of Germany, which was not the most accepting of the LGBTQIA+ community.
Therefore, every now and then when I left the city I lived in I felt like I had to hide my sexuality just to stay safe from homophobic attacks of any kind.
Then, in September 2017, I came to London and I was able to live fully openly as a gay man.
London is so diverse and the LGBTQIA+ community is very accepted here.
However, when I decided that I wanted to start studying Social Work at London Met, I wasnât sure if I could be open about my sexuality.
This insecurity resulted from Germany not being very accepting towards LGBTQIA+ social workers while I was living in foster care from the age of 15 to 18.
Luckily, the University was fully accepting of my sexuality and I got accepted for the course.
As the academic year started, I realised my fears were all for nothing.
The teaching staff were well educated about the LGBTQIA+ spectrum and also very accepting and welcoming towards me.
The University also made a very big step towards equality with opening a LGBTQIA+ forum in the academic year 18/19.
With this forum the University offered members of the LGBTQIA+ community a space where students who self-identified as part of the community could come together in a safe environment that allowed them to be themselves without having to fear any kind of judgment.
I appreciated this forum a lot as it was nice to get together with like-minded people again.
I felt as though it mattered to the University that the LGBTQIA+ community was fully respected.
In my second year, the student registers even gave students the chance to provide the lecturers with their preferred names.
In my opinion, this is a huge step towards accepting trans, genderfluid or non-binary individuals.
It gives those individuals the chance to avoid being referred to by their birth names, which might not represent their current person anymore.
All in all, I really feel like London Met has done a great job with providing an environment where I as a gay man feel accepted and comfortable.

Date: 11 April 2019
London offers various places for meeting up and spending time with friends.
I could write a list as long as an essay, but I have tried to be selective and give you what I consider to be the four most memorable places to visit!
Located near Kentish Town Station, Knowhere Special is an exceptional underground cocktail bar, great for a night out.
Only 20 minutes by bus from the University, itâs an excellent place for a few drinks after a long day of lectures and they offer mocktails too!
To get in, you go through a small and well-hidden door and then downstairs to the basement where the bar is.
There are a few seats at the bar, and there are three little alcove seating areas which provide a more secluded spot to sit with friends.
I loved the unusual entrance and the vibes of the place and really enjoyed spending time here when I last visited.
These secret and cheerful gardens are one the coolest I have ever seen in London.
I can guarantee that you will drain your phone battery taking pictures of the beautiful surroundings â I know I did!
In these gardens, youâll find multiple random objects transformed into art including: a colourful van, a small boat, a campfire, a robot made of scrap, and little boxes of plants.
There is a bar and cafÃ© area with chairs and sofas where people can chill out and enjoy nature too.
My favourite spot in the gardens is a small hub where there is a piano and a bookcase.
This artistic green oasis is in Shoreditch which is no more than 30 minutes from all of London Met's campuses.
The Vault is near Tottenham Court Road Station which again is no longer than 30 minutes from any of the Uni's campuses.
My friends and I discovered this bar through pure luck and itâs an excellent place for a cocktail night.
Like Knowhere Special, the entrance is fairly hidden.
I think this adds to the charm.
The door is concealed behind a large bookcase at the end of a corridor and beyond this, stairs lead down to the basement.
The bar has a chic and refined atmosphere and offers a vast array of cocktails.
One New Change shopping centre is near St.
Paulâs station.
If you take the lift up to the sixth floor, youâll find the rooftop terrace, from which you will get a close-up view of St.
Paulâs Cathedral dome.
The sight of some of the most iconic buildings in London makes you feel like you could almost touch the skyline.
I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves picturesque settings.
I hope this short guide will help you to discover new places and have a richer experience during your studies at London Metropolitan University.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/blogs/student-blogs/what-being-a-student-ambassador-means-to-me:
Date: 20 February 2020
My name is Yasmeen and Iâm studying International Relations .
Iâm also a first year so people are often surprised that Iâm so involved at London Met, because us first years take time to adjust to uni life.
While that was true for me, I had already told so many of my friends that I was âmade for uniâ, whatever that meant.
To me, university equates to opportunities, not just in regards to the academic side but also discovering parts of yourself you didnât know existed or finding out that youâre actually a pretty confident person if youâre surrounded by company thatâs right for you.
Thatâs why I chose to become a student ambassador â to find out who I really am and what Iâm capable of but also to help other people and step outside my comfort zone.
To me, being a student ambassador means a great deal of responsibility, not just to the University because youâre a representative, but also to the students you try to help.
Nothing fulfils me more than helping people.
Being a student ambassador gives me so many opportunities to influence a young personâs mindset and help raise their aspirations, not necessarily to go to university, but to go somewhere.
I remember this one higher education fair I worked at where I met this GCSE student who had no motivation to do anything after his GCSEs and was just filled with self-doubt.
If Iâm being honest, he reminded me of my younger self â I didnât believe I was smart enough or good enough to pursue any form of higher education or do anything worthwhile.
So when this student asked me, âWhat if Iâm not good at anything?â, I knew I had to do something to change this mindset of his, because if he didnât do it at 15, it would be a lot harder to change it at 17.
I told him that you couldnât reach the conclusion that youâre not good at anything if you havenât tried everything.
There were so many doors open for him.
After telling him this, he felt so much better and much more confident about himself, but as a lot of us know, building confidence takes time and is always a work in progress.
More than anything, I just wanted to enable him to help himself and grow in any way, shape or form.
Another reason I became a student ambassador is to provide prospective students with the correct information about London Met.
When I was in Year 13, trying to figure out the five universities I wanted to apply for, I went to London Metâs open days and the applicant day.
I met amazing student ambassadors who gave me valuable insight into university life and the lecturers were clearly passionate about what they did.
I applied and made it my first choice as well.
All the positive ideas I had about London Met were solidified when I started in September, especially through my inductions.
My lecturers are way more student-oriented than I thought and they genuinely want to help you succeed.
The Uni as a whole is incredibly inclusive and respectful of the diversity that exists, and I want to relay this information on prospective students who come to our open days.
I believe in London Met and I want other students to believe in it too.

We welcome students from all over the world and currently have more than 120 nationalities on campus.
The data below provides ethnicity, gender, age and disability representation across our staff.
Women make up 57% of our workforce.
Numbers of staff with declared disabilities remain low and with little change year on year.
There has been little change in employee age profile from last year.
We value and promote diversity and dignity at work through our staff development programmes, policies and practices, as well as new staff induction .
We also value the contribution of our staff and seek to ensure that they are supported and do not face unnecessary barriers to their employment.
We have set out our commitments in our Strategic Plan and in our Equality and Diversity Policy .
All job applicants are asked to submit an equality and diversity statement of no more than one page, articulating how they will contribute to making our University more inclusive and what they have previously done to advance equality.
We are a Disability Confident Employer
We are proud to take part in the government's Disability Confident scheme as a Disability Confident Employer and have published information to help and support our staff and our managers.
Our mean gender pay gap for 2022/23 is 5.99%, which is 1.66% lower than it was in 2021/22 (7.65%).
Our median gender pay gap for 2022/23 is 4.04%, which is 4.8% lower than it was in 2021/22 (8.83%).
UCEA benchmarking indicates that the 2022/23 median gender pay gap at the median HEI is 12%, meaning that our median gender pay gap is approximately 8% better than our comparators.
Our median gender pay gap is also 4.8% lower than it was in 2021/22.
2021/22 figures are shown in brackets.
The main reason for our pay gap is because we have more women than men in our lower pay quartile, which is almost entirely due to the composition of our employed students.
We have a strong commitment to providing our students with the best support and this includes giving them paid work to help them financially during their studies and to equip them with workplace skills that help them with their careers after they graduate and proudly employ our students via MetTemps, our own employment agency.
Estimates are that our MetTemps programme accounts for between 2% and 3% of our Gender Pay Gap.
MetTemp appointments are normally paid the London Living Wage (Â£11:05 p/hour in 2021/22) and make up between 9.18% (2016/17) and 18.12% (2019/20) of our overall workforce headcount.
Our MetTemp population generally represents our student population, so for 2021/22 women make up 63.39% of MetTemps with men making up 36.61%.
Our MetTemp workforce directly affects our Gender Pay Gap.
Since 2018/19, our data shows that the proportion of our workforce who are not MetTemps directly correlates with our Gender Pay Gap.
We maintain equal pay through a range of measures:
Our gender pay action plan aims to further reduce or eliminate our gender pay gap by:

We have a proud tradition of embracing and valuing diversity and this is reflected in our student body and staff, which we monitor and report on annually at the end of each academic year.
Our Transparency Return
Our 2025 Annual HR report provides profile data with key successes and challenges.
Age
73% of our staff fall within the 31-60 age range.
Recent years have seen a slight increase in the proportion of younger staff (aged < 30).
Our Professional Services staff tend to be younger than our Academic group.
Academic staff have more than twice the proportion of 60+ staff and a reducing proportion in the 51-60 age group (reducing from 27% to 24% between 2020-24)
Men are better represented in the older age groups (51 to 60 and Over 60).
Women are better represented in the younger age groups (21 to 30 and 31 to 40).
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
The data demonstrates increasing confidence in declaring, with 74% of staff disclosing their sexual orientation, up from 66% in 2020.
In 2023/24, 7% of staff who have declared sexual orientation identify as LGBTQ+, up from 5% in 2020/21.
Increasing numbers of staff are disclosing their gender identity status (79% in 2023/24)
Our Gender Pay Gap (GPG) - Our Mean GPG is 4.39% (our lowest reported value ever).
Our Median GPG is 5.82% which is significantly lower than the UK median GPG of 13.1% (ONS, 2024) and the HE sector median of 9.0% (Advance HE, 2024).
Staff Declarations - Staff declarations are increasing across all categories with the exception of disability.
However, disability declaration at 92% is notably high overall and the disability staff disclosure at 8%, is now above the average for the sector.
Senior representation â Increased female and BAME representation at senior levels and within our academic staff group.
BAME representation within our low - middle grades is now proportionate to overall workforce representation.
BAME representation is increasing most in our upper middle and above academic grades (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader) creating a talent pipeline but is still below the overall workforce representation.
The proportion of staff who declared a disability rose from 6% in 2020/21 to 8% in 2023/24 which is above the UK Higher Education disability disclosure rate of 7.2% (Advance HE reported in 2024).
Gender balance at Professorial level - Professor and Senior Professors roles have the lowest representation of women at 15 out of a total of 45 roles in 2023/24.
Gender Pay Gap - Women are less well represented in the upper pay quartile and over-represented in the lower pay quartile, which contributes to our remaining Gender Pay Gap.
Ethnicity Pay Gap  - Our Ethnicity pay gap is significantly above the sector average and is explained by the over-representation of BAME staff, at lower - mid grades within our structure.
A positive link to this is an increase in BAME representation overall and a growing pipeline which points to the importance of targeted positive action to support BAME staff to develop, secure promotions and help the institution close the gap.
Seniority - Minoritised staff (particularly BAME and LGBTQ+ Professional Service) are less likely to be represented in senior grades.
For LGBTQ+ Professional Staff, out of a population of 45, there are no reportable senior staff.
Learning difference such as dyslexia, dyspraxia or ADHD is most commonly cited (43%), followed by long term illness or health condition (21%) and an impairment, health condition or learning difference not listed (18%).
Strategy and action planning - Data will inform a review of priorities within our Charter Mark work (Athena SWAN, Stonewall and Disability Confident renewal, Race Equality Charter application and the Inclusive Culture strand of our People Strategy.
Staff declarations - We will periodically encourage our staff to declare using Oracle self-service to reduce unknown data.
People data dashboard - We are developing a People Dashboard as part of the Digital First Strategy which will focus on enhancing the quality and availability of demographic and intersectional data to our organisation and to leaders and managers, to enable the examination of trends by area.
Provision of applicant and appointee data - Following the implementation of the Oracle People and Finance system, we are focusing on being able to provide applicant and appointee data to support our Charter Mark work and equality plans.
Pay gap analysis - We will continue with our gender pay gap action plan with the aim of making more progress in closing our gap.
We will focus on gaining a better understanding of our ethnicity pay gap, through an ethnicity equal pay audit and intersectional equal pay audit and develop an action plan to address it in a swift, impactful way.
Talent management and pipeline support - We will design professional development interventions with our pipeline in mind, paying particular attention to where there are representational disparities in staff profile.
Impact of age-related policies - We will consider the impact of age-related policies as part of our staff engagement work, including understanding why there are differences between the Academic and Professional Staff profiles in the 60+ age group.
Our new HR system facilitates tracking participation and completion rates.

The University as it is today was created in 2002 with the merging  of London Guildhall University and the University of North London, the first merger between two universities in the UK.
Its roots, however, lie firmly in the nineteenth century with the establishment of the Metropolitan Evening Classes for Young Men in 1848.
In 1848 the then Bishop of London called upon the clergy to set up evening classes to improve the "moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in the metropolis".

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/about/jobs-at-london-met/how-to-apply-for-job-applicants:
At the university we utilise two different types of application form.
We use criteria-based application form for most of our jobs at the university and there are some roles such as research and teaching that utilise the CV-based application form.â¯
This type of application is used for most of our advertised roles at the university.
It allows the hiring manager to collect information in a structured template seeking examples that allow you to demonstrate your skills, competencies and experience for the role.
Remember, if you donât have direct experience for the role or this is your first job you can give examples from education or other roles of responsibility that you have held outside of work.
By highlightingâ¯transferable skillsâ¯in your answers, you will help us to see the potential that you have to perform in the role.
In all cases we remove access to the sensitive application data for the hiring manager and selection panel (age, religion, sexual orientation, sex, disability, nationality, ethnic origin).
We also use anonymous shortlisting for many roles, which means the panel will also not have sight of information such as your:â¯
This allows the selection panel to focus solely on the evidence you have provided in relation to your knowledge, skills and experience for the role.â¯
The âsensitive dataâ provided in your application is only visible to our Human Resources Team.
We ask that you do not reference any protected characteristic or share personal information in your criteria-based answers or supporting statement.
You can find more information about protected characteristics on ourâ¯ Equality, Diversity and Inclusion website.
We are continuously working to improve the inclusiveness of our recruitment processes and in most instances ourâ¯ criteria-based application â¯process is anonymised.
If you are applying via aâ¯ criteria-based application , ensure that you give specific examples to support your answers to the questions.
We recommend structuring your answers using the following technique to ensure the selection panel have all the information they need to make a shortlisting decision.â¯
Think about the question/criteria/competency/requirement you are evidencing and share an example to demonstrate how you meet it.â¯â¯
For some roles we use aâ¯ CV-based application .
This application type often applies to our research and teaching roles, where a CV and other supporting documents such as a publication list and a supporting statement/cover letter is required.â¯â¯
When making aâ¯ CV-based application , make sure you tailor your CV to reflect the role requirements, providing details of how you meet the skills and experience asked for in the role profile.
The role profile document is always attached to the bottom of the advert page.â¯â¯
Key things to include in your CV are:â¯
The âsensitive dataâ provided in your application is only visible to our HR Team and used for monitoring and reporting and, where relevant, to ensure we meet ourâ¯Disability Confident commitments.
We ask that you do not share personal information that references yourâ¯protected characteristicsâ¯in your CV, unless it is directly relevant to the skills, knowledge, experience or qualifications required for the role and detailed in the person specification.
We are taking this approach so applicants cannot be individually identified from their application information ahead of shortlisting and to ensure our recruitment processes are as inclusive as possible.
Within the additional information tab on the application form you have an option to provide extra information you could not include within your responses to the specific application questions or that might otherwise have included in your CV.
For example, your motivation for applying and why you think you are a good fit for the role.
You can also choose to use this section to add a cover letter if you wish, although this is not mandatory.
Please ensure you do not include your name and personal details in your additional information section and please do not include information which should be detailed under the relevant criteria for a criteria-based application.
The selection panel will rely on the information in the criteria-based application section to inform shortlisting decisionsâ¯
You may also use theâ¯additional information sectionâ¯to explain any gaps in your employment history that you feel may be relevant to include.
We recognise that people have varied career patterns and would encourage you to provide any details that you would wish to.
For example: you can detail that you took a career break and share your reasons why.â¯Please note, career breaks and any details that you share will not be taken into consideration during the selection process, they are forâ¯informationâ¯only and will not impact the selection decision.â¯
London Metropolitan University is proud to be a Disability Confident Employer .
Increasing the diversity of our employee community is extremely important to us and we are committed to the aims of Disability Confident Scheme, and:
As part of our commitment to Disability Confident, we ask all candidates (within the Equal Opportunities section of the application form) if they wish to be considered under this scheme should they meet the minimum criteria for the role.
By opting-in to this scheme, candidates will be disclosing that they have a disability solely for the purpose of the interview guarantee.
We will not assume nor infer that an applicant wishes to disclose or record their disability in any other way.
If you require any reasonable adjustments in order to attend the interview or complete any assessments required as part of the selection process, please let us know as soon as possible.â¯â¯
To learn how to make a good application, follow our guided steps.

The London Met Student Partnership Agreement (SPA) is an agreement between the students, the Studentsâ Union and the University.

These values and principles will be embedded into the culture of London Met, ensuring all staff and students are aware of the SPA and are committed to working together as partners.

The SPA reflects the commitments in those documents, defining what our work will look like in practice.
Read our latest staff blogs about the Student Partnership Agreement
Building a partnership approach to how we do things at London Met requires us to define what partnership is, and what values and underlying principles we will use to guide the approach we will take.

Committing to being open and honest, even when that may involve difficult or challenging conversations, as both an institution and as individuals.
Respect for one another is at the heart of all that students and staff do together
We are transparent, take responsibility and are held accountable for our actions and promises in everything we do.

Everyone experiences difficulties at some stage in life and studying at university is well known to be a challenging and sometimes stressful experience.
We meet with current students to discuss not only the difficulties you may experience but also to help you lead a more fulfilling and successful life, particularly at university.
Counselling provides an opportunity for you to think and talk about any personal or emotional difficulties that may be concerning you.
It is time and space to examine, clarify and understand these concerns and an opportunity to develop more effective ways of addressing them.
The majority of students who have used the service say that counselling is very supportive and valuable.
Many students describe counselling as a life-changing experience, which has made their time at university much more rewarding.
In many ways, mental health is just like physical health: everybody has it and we need to take care of it.
Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and react in the ways that you need and want to live your life.
But if you go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you're frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with.
This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse.
Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year.
They range from common problems, such as depression and anxiety , to rarer problems such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .
Meeting with a counsellor can provide a confidential space to express your thoughts, feelings and experiences in a confidential space.
It can also provide a better understanding of your mental health difficulties, ways to regulate your stress, and the support that you might need by specialist services outside the University.
This site, created by Mind , explains how having a mental health problem can impact upon being a student and suggests ways of coping.
We offer a Certificate in Personal Development and Emotional Awareness ; a free programme that we designed, which can be completed through a combination of distance learning, occasional workshops and the completion of a creative journal.

I was listened to in a non-judgmental manner and was given the awareness and tools available."

"It was easy for me to get in contact with my counsellor.
I could do this via email, telephone or going to their office."

He helped me to perceive things differently and he also empowered me.
I felt being heard, not being oppressed."
"It was professional but also very human and understanding.
I always felt comfortable talking and never judged.
Helped me think more clearly."

The elemental analysis service has been successfully running at London Metropolitan University for the past 40 years.
Solid and viscous liquid samples are weighed using Mettler Toledo high precision scale and analysed using ThermoFlash 2000.
Elemental analysis uses flash combustion that quantitively converts the sample into combustion gases of its elemental components.
An oxidation catalyst is used to complete the oxidation of the sample and a reduction catalyst is used to carry out any required reduction and remove any excess oxygen.
The resulting gases are measured with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The determination of the mass percentage of CHN elements in your sample is based upon the direct weight of the material sampled.
Thus, samples must be dry, free of impurities such as dust, rust, hair, aluminium foil, parafilm, and paper filter fibres (the most common contaminant).
Please inform the lab if and what metals, halides, or other interferences are within the sample.
If you require a quote, please email back the completed Elemental Analysis Quote Request Form .

Research is central to delivering the highest quality university educational experience.
The scholarship that staff undertake makes their teaching unique and this, in turn, impacts positively on what students can learn and aspire to.
Equally, student researchâwhether undergraduate projects, masterâs dissertations, or PhD thesesâdefines us further as the community that we are.
Smaller universities, such as ours, gain recognition in certain areas of research simply because they understand that they cannot cover all subjects in equal depth and focus instead on their strengths.
London Met, in particular, has an excellent reputation in subjects where high-quality research is connected to the real-world objectives of external partners, both in London and other regions and cities in the UK and internationally.
We are all familiar with what constitutes research and furthermore, research of the highest quality.
The metrics of measurement are clear, and we are confident we can continue to support work of the highest quality and standards.
Knowledge exchange (KE) is a newer concept.
Broadly, it embraces many facets of the work that we do and is a natural expression of our research.
More specifically, KE is defined as âa two-way exchange between researchers and research users, to share ideas, research evidence, experiences and skills.
It refers to any process through which academic ideas and insights are shared, and external perspectives and experiences brought in to academiaâ by the Econmic and Social Research Council.
The Office for Students also has a usable definition:
âKnowledge exchange is a process which brings together academic staff, users of research and wider groups and communities to increase the impact of research.â
Where a body of research empowers and influences partners both inside and outside the academy and then becomes an Impact Case Study for the Research Excellence Framework (REF), we see the perfect alignment of all elements of the Research and KE journey.

Date: 9 - 10 July 2025
London Met's sixth Student and Staff Research Conference was a great success that both showcased and enhanced our postgraduate research community and showed our aspirations and values in action.
It was opened by our Vice-Chancellor Professor Julie Hall and, for the first time, took place in the Great Hall, which provided an excellent setting for the conferenceâs plenary format and the accompanying poster exhibition.
Students and staff from all six schools contributed 15-minute papers or 3-minute lightning presentations over two days, addressing innovation in computing and science, sustainability in construction, social justice in relation to gender, child and health protection, and many other topics.
Highlights were the two keynotes by Dr Torange Lang , Reader in Art, Architecture and Design, and Phoebe Kalungi , Public Health Programme Lead for Children and Adolescentsâ¯in Tower Hamlets.
They both addressed issues of innovation and community in the realms of teaching (Torange) and health (Phoebe).
Both are alumni of the university, as is Dr Anthony Phipps , Security Design/Consultancy and Design Lead with Lloyds Banking Group, who delivered the well-received closing lecture on digitally securing our future.
Further standout features were the student-organised Vice-Chancellor's PhD Scholars panel and an Innovate UK â Supporting Business-led Innovation panel.
The former reported on challenging unexpected encounters that changed research projects for the better or worse.
The latter featured three presentations from London Met's Knowledge Transfer Partnership Associates and talks by Dr Edward Cole , Head of ICURe Regional Hub â London & South-East (England), and London Met's Dr Matthew Lam on the ICURe opportunities and application process.
It is a feature of the conference that students are involved in the planning, the chairing of panels and papers, and, very importantly, the judging for prizes.
Fidelis Ejike-Ume, a doctoral student at the Guildhall School of Business and Law and one of our prize judges for this year's conference, highlighted "the amazing presentations" and "impactful research being conducted by the London Met research community within the UK and abroad".
The 2025 prize-winners are:
Dr Eirini Meimaridou , PGR Coordinator at the School of Human Sciences and chair of the Postgraduate Research Student and Staff Liaison Forum, commented on "a fantastic two day event":

"There were so many standout moments that it's hard to choose", she added.
"However, one thing that truly stood out was the strong presence and contribution of PhD students.
Their involvement was evident across every aspect of the conferenceâfrom organising and presenting to leading insightful discussions.
This conference continues to showcase the power of student-staff collaboration, and Iâm already looking forward to the 2026 conference!"
Congratulations to the prize winners and a big thank you to all student volunteers!

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/research-hub/2025hidden/junehidden/london-met-researcher-awarded-leverhulme-research-fellowship:
Date: 25 May 2025
Dr Craig Lundy , Reader in Social and Political Thought at the School of Social Sciences and Professions, has been awarded a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship .
The two-year Fellowship, commencing in September 2025, will enable Craig to carry out research on the thematic âAfter Progress: Revaluing Life Amidst Catastropheâ.
The Leverhulme Trust offers Fellowships for experienced researchers to spend between 3 and 24 months completing a piece of research.
Craigâs research will investigate the question: Can we reimagine human and more-than-human arts of living and flourishing from the ruins of âprogressâ?
Progress is one of the most influential ideas in history.
It is invariably appealed to when reflecting on the course of social groups and individual lives.
But as the threat of ecological devastation and Covid-19 have brought into sharp relief, if the pursuit of progress leads to the imperilment of the Earth and life as we know it, then what does this idea really mean and how do we go beyond it?
By cross-pollinating developments in âprocess philosophyâ, âcomplexity sciencesâ and experiments in pursuing life âafter progressâ, Craigâs research will seek to explore and articulate promising possibilities for revaluing life amidst catastrophe.
Literature on âprogressâ has to date been predominantly concerned with debating the âendsâ of progress and how to get there.
But most interestingly, both advocates and critics of progress â from decolonial critiques on the left to conservative reactionaries on the right â largely share in their affiliation of progress with the ethic of betterment.
They also share an overriding focus on the content of progress: what âcountsâ as progress.
Craigâs research will attempt to bring into question not merely the goal or object of progress, but the nature of this idea as a process.
By problematising the âformâ of the idea of progress, not merely its âcontentâ, the research hopes to make a useful contribution to the construction of promising alternatives.
âIâm really excited to embark on this researchâ, Craig comments.
âOver several years Iâve had a lot of conversations about the idea of âprogressâ with academics from diverse disciplines, and many people outside of academia.
What Iâve discovered is that pretty much everyone has an opinion on the topic, and valuable insights.
Most of my work on the topic up till now has focused on bringing these insights and contributions into conversation with one another, for example through an edited collection I put together and an artistic digital exhibition I curated.
But now I get the chance to more fully focus on articulating my own views on the topic.â
âThe surrounding climateâ, Craig acknowledges, âhas, rather depressingly, made this topic increasingly pertinent, as more and more people come to see the future as darker than the past.
Despite this, however, the idea of progress lives on, in a similar fashion to âhopeâ.
This is perhaps not surprising, since the idea of progress has survived many bleak moments, such as the two world wars.
Nonetheless, Iâd like to think that a thorough deconstruction of the concept, combined with the experimentation of alternatives, can be of help for navigating our contemporary predicament.â
Professor Svetlana Stephenson , Head of Research and Knowledge Exchange for the School of Social Sciences and Professions, adds: âThis is fantastic news for Craig and for London Met.
Being awarded a Leverhulme Research Fellowship is a major achievement and a testament to the strength and originality of Craigâs work.
His research addresses vital questions about how we live and think in a time of global uncertainty, and it is exciting to see this important project being developed here.
I look forward to seeing the contribution it will make not only to academic debates but also to wider public conversations about how we imagine the future.â

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/in-todays-unstable-world-education-about-biosecurity-risks-is-a-missing-string-to-our-bow:
Date: 18 June 2025
While no-one may know what caused the Covid outbreak, Professor Lijun Shang of London Met believes the pandemic should be a defining wake-up call for the world.
What more visceral example do we need about how biohazards can spread uncontrollably, wreaking global havoc?
Such hazards can be anything from a mutating virus to which we have no immunity, to crops which have been manipulated to become poisonous, to nerve agents like Novichok, as used by the Russian state in Salisbury in 2018.
âWe know the impacts of the Covid pandemic were profound in almost every area of human existence â health-wise, psychologically, socially, economically.
And yet, since 2019, the stakes have been raised considerably by a new development in science and technologyâ, says Shang, a professor of biomedical science in London Metâs School of Human Sciences.
That new development is Artificial Intelligence.
Just as AI can be used for aiding âdrug discoveryâ â the process of refining medication until it becomes most effective against pathogens â it can also be used for the reverse: the creation of biohazards.
As demonstrated by every sci-fi villain in literature and film, scientific advances can be used for good but also for harm.
And, without proper governance, the advent of AI has opened up the potential for harm more dramatically than ever before.
âAI is one of the hot topics in biosecurity at the momentâ says Professor Shang.
âWhen the technology is developing this fast, and when gene-editing has become so easy, how can we continue to keep the world safe from nefarious actors who want to use biological advances to cause harm?â
There are various ways to maintain global stability in this context, explains Professor Shang.
Among these, international collaboration and education are important.
This is why Shangâs centre at London Met, the Biological Security Research Centre , is building the International Biological Security Education Network (IBSEN).
It hopes to be similar in scope to the International Nuclear Security Education Network (INSEN) which is organised through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and its work will be akin to the work of the Advisory Board on Education and Outreach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
IBSEN does not yet receive UN funding.
The work of IBSEN will address: firstly, policy makers to set up proper national and international biosecurity strategies; secondly, scientists and professionals, for building an appreciation of concerns about the âdual useâ of research; and thirdly, the general public, to improve their understanding of biosecurity risks.
Since 2020, the centre has been developing new methodologies and creating new initiatives to boost biosecurity education nationally and internationally to address the challenges and drive impact.
For example, Oliva Ibbotson, a PhD candidate in the Biological Security Research Centre, has recently been leading a piece of work to pilot education in secondary schools for STEM students.
Itâs a complex and challenging subject matter.
Olivia explains how she attracts interest from the young people:
âI pique studentsâ interest in advance, by promoting the workshops with a degree of mystery to try to build their curiosity about what they might be about.
Iâm aware that students aged 16-18 years are likely to be under a lot of stress with exams, and so I keep the workshops casual and low pressure, with quizzes, games and ultimately, in the third and final workshop, a simulation exercise.
The scenario is that there is a biosecurity outbreak at the school, and the students have different roles, and it is up to them to decided how to respond to the developing situation.
âI also use pop-culture references, like movies, TV series, video games and even music, to help them relate to the ideas and issues.
âSo, I make it fun, but ultimately my aim is for the students to use the insights they learn, and the interest theyâre building, in the future.
What Iâd love is to see biosecurity included in secondary school curriculum, and at foundation degree-level education, so that the next generation of professionals are armed with a real understanding about the threats we face.â
In a world where conspiracy theories are rife, and where misinformation is itself a weapon of rogue states, perhaps education for the next generation is the greatest tool in our kit to combat biosecurity risks.

Professor Louise Ryan has been ranked among the top 0.5% of scholars worldwide in the 2024 ScholarGPS rankings, which assess more than 30 million academic profiles.
She placed 49th globally in social network research, recognising her outstanding contributions to the field.
ScholarGPS uses a rigorous, data-driven methodology assessing research productivity, impact, and quality across 14 fields, 177 disciplines, and more than 350,000 specialties.
Its rankings reflect exceptional scholarly output and influence, with Professor Ryanâs work demonstrating consistent academic leadership.
Reflecting on this career milestone, Professor Ryan said: âThis recognition reflects years of collaborative research and the importance of making visible the lived experiences behind the data,â Louise said.
âIâm particularly proud that work rooted in real-world impact can be honoured alongside more traditional metrics of academic excellence.â
The announcement comes during a period of notable public and academic engagement surrounding Professor Ryanâs most recent book, Irish Nurses in the NHS, co-authored with GrÃ¡inne McPolin, a documentary maker, based in Ireland, and London Met PhD student Neha Doshi.
The book explores the lives of Irish women who migrated to Britain to work in the National Health Service.
In April, the book was launched in Dublin by the Irish Minister for Health at a ceremony hosted by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, an honour underscoring the bookâs national significance.
That same month, Ryan appeared on Irelandâs national broadcaster, RTE, for her second interview about the book.
More recently, the Mayor of Liverpool formally launched the book at a major civic event attended by local community organisations from across the city in May.
The event recognised the contributions of nine Liverpool-based participants featured in the book.
Ahead of the launch, Louise and Grainne were interviewed on BBC Radio Merseyside to discuss the event and the bookâs continuing impact.
âWe always hoped the book would resonate with the communities who shared their stories, but the depth and warmth of the response has been genuinely humbling,â said Professor Ryan.
âItâs clear that the legacy of Irish nurses in the NHS is deeply cherished, and this project has shown just how profoundly Irish communities have shaped healthcare and society in Britain.â
The continued engagement and public response underscore the broad cultural and scholarly impact of the book and Professor Ryanâs work.

Dr Bhaven Patel, Dr Daniel Sykes and Dr Rhiannon Brooksâ innovations help students to achieve their true potential and have contributed to graduate outcomes.
Date: 3 June 2025
Three academics from London Metropolitan Universityâs Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences were recently shortlisted for two prestigious national teaching awards, recognising their transformative approach to inclusive, employability-focused education.
Dr Bhaven Patel, Dr Daniel Sykes and Dr Rhiannon Brooks were shortlisted for the AGCAS Academic Employability Award in the Curriculum Design for Employability category through a partnership with Noclor , the NHS Research Office, of the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust.
They were also finalists for the LearnSci Teaching Innovation Awards , having previously won in 2021.
The entries focussed on their work redesigning second-year cross discipline modules using digital learning tools and student-centred practices.
âWeâre always looking for ways to enhance the learning experience for our students,â said Dr Sykes.
âWeâre delighted to be recognised by these prestigious national awards, itâs a testament to the hard work of our team and the voices of our students that shape what we do.â
Transforming outcomes
In their judgement of the Londo n M et Entry , the LearnSci award judges recognised the focus on tackling systemic barriers:
âDifferential outcomes of minoritised groups are often perpetuated by systematic biases that are hard to isolate and change,â the judges noted.
âThis project however has shown clear progress towards a significant narrowing of the awarding gap which is fantastic!â
Their project used interactive digital tools called LearnSci Smart Worksheets and LabSims to make second-year chemistry topics, such as analytical, inorganic and physical chemistry, easier to understand and more engaging.
Since making these changes, student marks have improved dramatically, rising from below 50 percent to over 75 percent on average.
More than 90 percent of students are now passing these modules, and the gap in results between different student groups has significantly narrowed.
Innovations were driven by student feedback.
These included introducing Smart Worksheets in the first year to reduce assessment anxiety, increasing time for digital exams, and refining assessment language.
Students also received supplementary marks for showing written calculations.
Employability focus
To enhance employability, the team developed a spectroscopy-themed âchemistry escape roomâ and partnered with Noclor to offer CV support, application guidance and interview preparation, alongside ongoing work with colleagues Tiffany Platt, Vanessa Airth, Shauna Arnold and Alexandra Banks in the Graduate Success team.
As a result, the BSc Chemistry graduate outcome score reached a three-year average of 89%.
Seventy percent of students in the department identify as being from ethnic minority backgrounds, and many are mature or international learners.
The teamâs efforts support London Metâs Education for Social Justice and Careers Education Frameworks, as well as its widening participation goals.
Their work has also secured funding from the Royal Society of Chemistry to develop further digital tools for mature learners.
While the awards ultimately went to other nominees, the recognition affirms the departmentâs position as one of the most innovative of its kind in the country in evidence-based innovation and educational equity.

Professor MichaÅ Garapich, on what inspired That Boy, the risks involved, and what it reveals about extremism, reconciliation and the possibility of change
In the powerful new documentary That Boy , a reformed Polish neo-Nazi meets a Roma man who experienced anti-Roma violence growing up.
The film captures a rare and raw dialogue between a former perpetrator and a victim.
A few weeks on from its premiere, at the European Parliament in Brussels on 9 April , we spoke to Professor MichaÅ Garapich to discover how the film came about.
What inspired you to initiate the dialogue between a reformed neo-Nazi and a Roma attack victim in That Boy ?
Itâs a complex story, but in short, it came out of our research into the Polish-British transnational far-right.
We were exploring different far-right milieus.
Many of the people my team â Dr Anna Jochymek, Dr RafaÅ Soborski, and I â interviewed had been involved in football or music-based skinhead subcultures in Poland during the 1990s.
That world often involved a lot of violence, much of it directed at Roma people.
Through my other research interests, I also know many Polish Roma who lived through that period and experienced that violence.
So I found myself hearing both sides: from victims and from perpetrators.
Eventually, I met Mirek, a former skinhead.
As part of his church work, he visits prisons to speak with inmates.
One day, he told me heâd be willing to meet someone he had â even indirectly â hurt, and ask for forgiveness.
That made me think of Toby GÃ³rniak, a Roma man from Poland who I met in Plymouth in 2017.
Weâd been talking for a while about making a film, but many early attempts fell through.
Filming former extremists brings complex ethical, political and personal challenges.
Then I thought: why not connect Mirek and Toby â and film it?
It's rare to see individuals like Toby and Mirek come together.
Were they open to the discussion, and how did you ensure they both felt it was a safe space?
It might seem rare, but life is often more surprising than we assume.
I met Mirek in a Polish-speaking Pentecostal church in Cambridge.
He was already talking to Roma families there, so the idea wasnât entirely new to him.
I asked if heâd be willing to talk outside a religious framework â with someone who didnât share the same ideas about conversion or redemption.
He said yes.
Toby understood the significance of it straight away.
For him, this wasnât just symbolic â it was personal.
He wanted to confront what it meant to be seen as a victim and to challenge that label directly.
Speaking with someone who had once hated Roma people offered a way to do that.
They were both willing.
My role was to be a gentle â I hope â intermediary and to document the exchange.
In terms of safety, we agreed from the start that both would have final say over what was shown.
Nothing would be included without their consent.
But emotional safety is another matter.
This wasnât a light conversation â they knew it would be hard from the outset.
Academics often like to control variables.
Was it nerve-wracking to make a film where you couldnât predict how it would unfold?
Yes, definitely.
Iâd never made a film before, and this one was unscripted, spontaneous.
That said, Iâm an anthropologist â my work often involves dealing with the unplanned and unexpected.
I had a general sense of how the conversation might go, but no guarantees.
Toby and his film crew, New Vandal Media, had a loose plan and led the production side.
If anyone had control over the set-up, it was them.
Even so, editing the film became a collaborative process.
The really nerve-wracking moment came when the film was selected to premiere at Roma Week at the European Parliament.
Making a film is one thing.
Showing it to an audience emotionally connected to its themes is another entirely.
Netflixâs Adolescence shows a 13-year-old radicalised online.
How does That Boy contrast with or complement fictional portrayals of youth radicalisation?
Itâs a good question.
On the surface, That Boy seems very different: two adult men, talking about the 1990s in Poland â a very different time and place.
But dig into their conversation and youâll see familiar themes: broken families, isolation, a need to belong, violence, masculinity.
Itâs all there.
Theyâre honest.
They open up.
And that shows the value of dialogue.
At the heart of it all is the vulnerability of youth.
Do you think political leaders and educators fully understand how young people are being drawn into extremism?
I donât think political leaders have much understanding at all.
The recent riots are a case in point.
Educators, on the other hand, are more in touch.
There are strong programmes and committed individuals working on this.
Britain has long dealt with extremism and terrorism, and thereâs some institutional memory.
But technology moves quickly.
Extremism adapts fast, and policymakers often struggle to keep up.
The internet makes violent content easily accessible.
That makes it dangerously easy for young people to get pulled in.
How did policymakers and experts respond to the film at the European Parliament?
The screening was part of Roma Week â organised by the European Roma Grassroots Organisations Network.
Itâs an annual gathering of Roma activists from across Europe.
This year was particularly poignant â it marked 80 years since the end of the Roma Holocaust.
Roma communities have fought for decades for proper recognition of their persecution under the Nazis.
So showing a conversation between a Roma man and a former neo-Nazi was confronting for many in the room.
The reactions were powerful.
Some people cried.
Others asked hard, sceptical questions.
There was also genuine praise.
Thanks to Toby, I think people saw the value of it.
We collected over 30 detailed pieces of feedback.
The response was overwhelmingly positive.
For Roma viewers especially, it was moving to see someone openly acknowledge their past violence and ask for forgiveness.
What role do you think That Boy can play in raising awareness and fostering dialogue?
Many people assume this kind of conversation could never happen.
The film challenges that idea.
It shows these moments do happen â and they matter.
This wasnât staged.
These were real people with raw emotions.
And it shows that academics can influence the world beyond universities.
We live in diverse, multicultural cities.
Everyday encounters across ethnic or religious lines are one of our best defences against hate and extremism.
Mirek and Toby could have this conversation partly because they were used to that diversity â they live in England.
Thereâs also a bigger message here: people can change.
Even those who once held hateful, violent views.
I hope this film makes some people stop and think.
About what they believe.
And about the harm those beliefs may be causing â to others and to themselves.
Looking at the journeys of Toby and Mirek, what do they teach us about de-radicalisation and personal transformation?
Every story of change is different.
But for both of them, parenthood was a turning point.
Theyâre both fathers.
And being a parent âwith a pastâ is hard.
You worry your child might make the same mistakes.
That fear can be a powerful motivator.
When people begin to care about the next generation, thatâs when change becomes possible.
But it needs work.
We have to keep talking about the past â and confronting it.
Hate doesnât disappear on its own.
It lingers.
Mirek and Toby are trying to lay some of those demons to rest.
Thatâs a good thing.
As a society, we should do the same.
Academics, artists, educators and policymakers all have a role in that process.
We help people tell their stories â and make sense of them.
"On the surface, That Boy seems very different [to Netflix show Adolescence]: two adult men, talking about the 1990s in Poland â a very different time and place.
But dig into their conversation and youâll see familiar themes: broken families, isolation, a need to belong, violence, and masculinity.
Itâs all there." Dr Michal Garapich ----- That Boy will be featured at a special screening at the Science and Media Museum in Bradford on Saturday 14 June 2025.
This screening will feature an exclusive live Q&A with theâ¯Romaâ¯man himself, Toby Gorniak MBE.

Date: 22 May 2025
FORESTED ( Future-Oriented Regeneration of Ecological Spaces through Timber, Education and Design ) is a regenerative design collaboration between London Metropolitan University, The Royal Danish Academy and Bexley Council, intended to amplify ecological citizenship in one of Londonâs largest urban woodlands.
Beginning in September 2025, the 12-month project will provide woodland furniture within Lesnes Abbey Woods , made from locally sourced trees, opening the landscape to increased amenity use and enhanced local ecology.
This work will be led by George Fereday , Associate Teaching Professor at the School of Art, Architecture and Design .
Funded by the Ecological Citizen(s) Network+ , this project will enhance engagement with 88 hectares of urban woodland, using digital design tools and community fabrication of public furniture from underutilised hardwood tree species.
The project will take place at a newly built woodland hub, âThe Clearingâ, and engage established community volunteer groups in advocacy for the local ecology.
Connecting woodland management, in-situ use of harvested timber, and amenity access to woodland, the project will create a template for ecological citizenship in other community woodlands.
The project aligns both with the Universityâs strategy of âgiving back to the cityâ set out in its Civic Statement , and regional goals set out in the London Urban Forest Plan , including:
The Ecological Citizen(s) Network+ is a UK Research and Innovation funded project based at the Royal College of Art.
Responding to the urgency of climate and ecological crises, the Network funds innovative, short-term projects that explore Ecological Citizenship for a sustainable digital society.
In 2025, applicants were invited to share their ideas with the Ecological Citizen(s) Network+ around the theme of The Natural World.
FORESTED was one of 15 ground-breaking projects selected for funding , out of 85 applications received.
George Fereday, Principle Investigator, said: âSupport from the Ecological Citizens Network + will help us demonstrate the latent potential of urban woodland for ecological and societal change.
Using digital tools, we will intertwine functional use of hardwood, enhance woodland ecologies and expand human experiences of these vital urban spaces.
We hope this combination will reinvigorate local woodland culture and act as a template for ecological conservation and community action in other council-run woodlands across the region.â
Anne Markey , Dean of the School of Art, Architecture and Design, added: âI am delighted that George Fereday has been awarded funding by the Ecological Citizen(s) project which will enable him to continue his valuable research into the use of woodland timber for sustainable structural design to address Climate Change whilst supporting our treasured woodlands.â

Date: 20 May 2025
A new UK-wide study led by London Metropolitan University is calling for volunteers who have experienced cyberharassment or online stalking to take part in a groundbreaking research project.
The ECHO Project, led by Professor Emma Short, is investigating the real-world impact of online abuse such as harassment, stalking, and unwanted digital contact.
The study aims to give voice to those affected by technology-enabled abuse and help shape better support systems and responses.
âWe know that technology can be used to exert control, intimidate, and harm,â said Professor Short.
âThis project is about understanding those lived experiences so we can improve safety and support for people who are affected.â
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 1.5 million adults in England and Wales experienced stalking in the year ending March 2024.
Of those cases, 42% involved online abuse, including threatening messages and harassment on social media.
The Suzy Lamplugh Trust reports that just 1.7% of stalking cases lead to a conviction, showing a clear need for improved support and a stronger response to these crimes.
Get involved
Participants are invited to complete a confidential online survey, which takes approximately 20â30 minutes.
The survey includes space to share experiences in greater detail, if desired, and all responses are anonymous.
Who can take part?
Take part in the survey
The findings will inform future policies and practices aimed at tackling online abuse and creating safer digital environments.
The project is part of ongoing research within London Metâs Forensic Cyberpsychology Research Group , led by Professor Emma Short in collaboration with Dr Chelsea Mainwaring.
The group also investigates bystander responses to online abuse and how the criminal justice system addresses technology-enabled harassment.
For more information, contact Dr Mainwaring at c.mainwaring@londonmet.ac.uk.
Professor Emma Short (pictured above) is one of the UKâs only experts in cyberpsychology.
She has conducted research in cyberstalking, image based sexual abuse and technology facilitated abuse since 2005, working with partners in the third sector, higher education, the police and government bodies.
She continues to work with a wide network of academics and practitioners within the UK and internationally whose focus is on cyber enabled behaviours and online harms.

SiÃ¢n Moxon says rewilding cities starts in our own back gardens.
Date: 16 April 2025
âWe canât rewild our cities without winning hearts and mindsâ, says London Metropolitan Universityâs SiÃ¢n Moxon.
SiÃ¢n is the creator of the award-winning Rewild My Street campaign, and she is an associate professor of sustainable architecture in the universityâs School of Art, Architecture and Design.
Her research project, Wild Ways â a collaboration with associate professor Justin Webb - investigates how people can be persuaded to turn their London gardens into spaces for nature recovery, using behaviour change and design approaches.
âOver the years, as a researcher, itâs become clearer and clearer to me that if we want greener, healthier, wilder cities, we need to bring people with us.
Any changes we advocate need to work for people as well.â
But why do we need greener cities at all?
SiÃ¢n explains: âweâre at a point in history where urban rewilding is now vital.
By 2050, nearly 70 per cent of humanity is expected to live in urban areas by 2050.
âOne of the problems with that is that human-made materials in cities create an abundance of hard, dark surfaces which both absorb and radiate heat, and also rapidly shed rainwater.
And these lead to sky-high temperatures, and flash flooding.
âSo, our cities are not places where we can live comfortably during extreme weather events â whether thatâs during heat waves, or intense rainfall.
And, with climate change, these things are only going to become more frequent.â
SiÃ¢n explains that leafy urban spaces can help: trees provide shade, and their canopies catch heavy rainfall.
And, of course, they are a habitat for wildlife.
Research shows that rewilding cities helps people as much as it does other species.
Being in nature boosts our mental health, and calms us by reducing our stress levels.
Whatâs more, patients recover more quickly in hospital where they have a view of nature.
In offices and schools, workers and pupils are more productive when they can see nature.
And in cities, access to nature supports creativity, child development and social interaction.
It is even associated with lower crime rates.
But at the moment, city-dwellers are a long way from such an ideal:
âMany adults experience âplant blindnessâ, when they no longer notice wild plants.
And sadly, most children cannot name even common wildlife, such as bumblebees, blue tits and oak treesâ says SiÃ¢n.
So, SiÃ¢n, Justin and a wider team of academic collaborators set out to pool their design and behaviour change skills to create an evidence base for how to entice people to rewild their cities, via their own gardens.
Wild Ways was born.
With a brief to understand and influence urban-rewilding behaviour in Londonâs private residential gardens, the research project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Kusuma Trust UK.
The research follows four stages: firstly, a literature review of existing studies; secondly, surveys of London residents to understand the capability, opportunity and motivational factors influencing urban-rewilding behaviour; thirdly, co-creating an intervention strategy with London residents to promote the desired behaviour; and fourthly, testing of the intervention strategy through Rewild My Street, with support from the Design Museumâs Future Observatory, industry partner Kusuma Trust and other experts.
The team have completed the first phase and are awaiting publication of papers for stages two and three.
They are about to embark on the fourth stage which will see them trialling messages on social media, to understand which narratives drive engagement and ultimately, behaviour change.
Are people in their target audience motivated by broader issues about climate change and biodiversity loss, or about the health and other benefits they stand to gain personally, or in how wilder cities can solve practical problems?
The team will publish their results for the benefit of other pro-environment campaigns.
But how willing are people likely to be to hand over their private gardens to nature, and to let weeds and other uninvited guests take root?
âI guess that's where I want to come in as a designerâ says SiÃ¢n.
âWhile there may need to be a little bit acceptance of âmessâ, there's also a role that design can play in making these spaces look nice most of the time.
There are ways to do that by containing or framing wild patches, or contrasting it with more geometry.
For example, in my own garden, I have a lot of messy log piles, but I have one that I have made into a perfect circle.
So, the overall effect is of a habitat which has been created intentionally.
SiÃ¢n continues: âwith gardens, people want to see that they are looked after and not neglected.
Thatâs why people often label their wildflower patches as for pollinators, or mow the edges of their lawn to create a sense of contrast and a nod to neatness.â
There are indications that the vision of untamed nature in cities bursting with life is not unrealistic.
Counter-intuitively, for many species, cities are already an important refuge.
Urban hedgehogs, foxes and herring gulls are more successful than their rural cousins.
Studies show that more biodiversity is found in urban ponds than rural ones.
Peregrine falcons thrive in cities â including at London Met itself - having adapted to substitute tall buildings for their conventional clifftop nesting sites.
They occupy over 200 urban sites in the UK.
SiÃ¢n says that âparticularly in people's private gardens, we need to create a bit of a mind shift to help people to understand that your garden can contribute to something bigger, and that it does matter.â
And so, the holy grail is to create a network of wilder gardens offering food for birds, bats and pollinators, and through which species like hedgehogs and foxes can move, forage and make a home.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/i-would-say-sorry-neo-nazi-and-roma-attack-victim-come-face-to-face-in-powerful-new-film:
A powerful new film developed by London Metropolitan University academics brings together a reformed violent neo-Nazi and a Roma man who was brutally attacked by 'skinheads' as a child.
That Boy premiered at the European Parliament in Brussels on 9 April 2025 as part of Roma Week, in front of an audience of MEPs, policy experts and civil society groups.
The University was also represented by Dean of the School of Sciences and Professions, Kelly Marie Cooper, and Maeva Khachfe, London Metâs Director of Research and Knowledge Exchange.
Believed to be the first film ever to depict a conversation between a former neo-Nazi and a Roma victim, That Boy was created by London Met researchers Professor Michal P.
Garapich, Dr Anna Jochymek and Dr Rafal Soborski as part of their work exploring the roots of violent extremism and how to confront rising hate and intolerance across Europe.
The filmâs stark and honest conversation saw Roma activist Toby Gorniak MBE sit across a table from Mirek, a former skinhead.
Both men, originally from Poland, now live in the UK.
A brutal attack
In the 1990s, Toby was beaten and left for dead as a child by three adult men, targeted simply for being Roma.
Following the attack and amid a wave of escalating racist violence, his mother fled the country with the family for their safetyâpacking a bag and leaving in a taxi with no destination in mind.
In their intense exchange, both men described their early lives.
Toby spoke of realising, aged five, that he would always be hated because of his ethnicity.
Mirek, in contrast, described a loving childhood until his parentsâ divorce.
He traced his radicalisation to the emotional fallout of that event, which left him feeling rejected and vulnerable.
Seeking belonging, he found brotherhood among violent neo-Nazi skinheads.
Encouraged by Tobyâs questioning, Mirek openly described how he descended into hatred and violence, including violence towards women.
But living in the UK in his thirties, he encountered multiculturalism and Christianityâand to his surprise, the hatred left him.
He attributed the change to the influence of God.
In one deeply moving moment, Mirek shared childhood photographs and discussed the stories behind his tattoos, including a swastika that his daughters have urged him to remove.
He explained that he chooses to keep it as a painful reminder of his past.
Now both advocates against hate, Toby works with young people through charitable programmes, while Mirek shares his story to warn others of the dangers of extremism.
Towards the end of the film, Mirek offered Toby a heartfelt apology on behalf of those who attacked him.
Asked by the director what he would say to Toby as a child, he replied, visibly emotional: âI would say sorry.â Toby, in turn, thanked Mirek for his courage in meeting him.
For more information on the project, please visit the Everyday transnationalism of the Right page.
Exploring radicalisation
That Boy was produced as part of a research project on the transnationalism of the far right, led by Professor Garapich, Dr Soborski and Dr Jochymek.
Their interdisciplinary study examines Polish immigrantsâ engagement with right-wing groups in the UK and is funded by UK Research and Innovation.
Professor Michal P.
Garapich, from the Global Diversities and Inequalities Research Centre at London Met, said:
âI am grateful to both Mirek and Toby for their courage and candour.
We cannot tackle extreme ideologies without understanding their roots, which means speaking directly to those who once held them.
This film is especially relevant in todayâs world, where far-right ideologies and intolerance are on the rise.â
â That Boy explores the moments when young boys become vulnerable to radicalisation.
Our research shows that rejection or abuse from family often makes them susceptible to the appeal of violent ideologies.
These are vital lessons for society.â
Dr Anna Jochymek, postdoctoral research assistant at London Met, added:
âIntolerance is rising globally, and our research suggests toxic masculinity often plays a role.
We canât address it without understanding it.
Beneath this hard-hitting film lies a hopeful story of redemption and mutual understanding.â
âIn todayâs uncertain world, That Boy shows us a path away from violenceâthrough dialogue, empathy and accountability.â

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/london-met-research-at-the-heart-of-new-police-training-guidance-on-sexual-offending:
Professor Fiona Vera-Gray and Jo Lovettâs work has led to new national guidance, strengthening police response to non-contact sexual offences.
Date: 17 February 2025
In 2024, London Metropolitan Universityâs Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit (CWASU) was commissioned, alongside Professor Clare McGlynn of Durham University, to conduct new research to understand the nature and extent of non-contact sexual offending as well as to explore challenges in the current police response.
The CWASU team translated their findings into new guidance, announced today by the College of Policing - the professional body for police leadership, standards, and performance - which has been developed into e-learning for officers across England and Wales.
The new measures are a direct response to the Angiolini Inquiry, led by Dame Elish Angiolini DBE KC, which was launched following the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer with a known history of non-contact sexual offending.
Non-contact sexual offences (NCSOs) are sexual crimes that do not involve physical contact between the offender and the victim.
These include offences such as indecent exposure, voyeurism, upskirting, and sending unsolicited sexual images.
While they do not involve direct physical harm, NCSOs can cause significant psychological distress and are often part of a pattern of escalating or repeated offending.
Transforming Police Response
"One of the reasons why non-contact sexual offending is starting to be taken seriously is because it was featured so heavily in the offending history of Wayne Couzens," explained Professor Vera-Gray .
"Dame Angiolini recommended that there needed to be a step change with more guidance and training for officers, and this is hopefully fulfilling that."
P rofessor Vera-Grayâs research with the College of Policing, build s on her involvement in a previous project on sexual exposure conducte d for the College of Policing, as well as Operation Soteria - a nationwide initiative to improve rape investigations and prosecutions with a victim-centred, suspect-focused approac h - demonstrates that these offences are not minor or isolated but often part of a repeated pattern of harmful behaviour.
Changing Attitudes Towards Non-Contact Sexual Offences
The research challenges the assumption that non-contact sexual offences are only a concern if they escalate into more serious crimes.
Findings show that many offenders do not escalate but instead commit these crimes repeatedly against multiple victims.
This reinforces the need for robust police intervention from the outset.
"People sometimes think that offences like indecent exposure or voyeurism arenât serious because they donât cause physical injury," Professor Vera-Gray said.
"Because thereâs no physical contact, theyâre seen as less harmful and not needing as thorough a response."
While this new guidance is just the start of the process, Professor Vera-Gray is hopeful that attitudes are changing.
"Working with the College of Policing and individual officers from forces across England and Wales has been really heartening," she said.
"I can really see that there seems to be a desire within policing to make a change.
Thereâs been a recognition of the problem, and thereâs a desire for change."
Chief Superintendent Jamie Daniels, College of Policing, said: "This training weâve developed,  based on the research from Professor Vera-Gray and Dr McGlynn, will be vital in reframing the way police approach and respond to non-contact sexual offences.
Their research provided the strong evidence base we needed to lay out the facts and challenge misconceptions â particularly around the severity and patterns of offending relating to NCSOs.
"Sadly, we know these offences can be precursors to, or indicators of, more serious crimes.
By improving early investigation and intervention, we can better protect the public by spotting repeat behaviour patterns and ensure weâre investigating these crimes with the level of attention they deserve, right from the outset."
Turning Research into Action
The Angiolini Inquiry called for urgent improvements in how police handle these offences.
The new guidance ensures that officers are trained to recognise patterns of offending and act early to prevent further harm.
By placing expert research at the heart of its approach, the College of Policing is demonstrating a firm commitment to tackling sexual violence and Professor Vera-Grayâs work is central to that.

I have enjoyed every moment.
This experience has made me realised how much I want to continue with research and so, currently, I am undertaking my PhD studies in School of Human Sciences at London Met.
My PhD topic is focused on the effects of microplastics in human health.
Microplastics are created by the weathering and breakdown of plastic objects, car tires, clothing, paint coatings and leakage of pre-production pellets and powders.
They may also be intentionally added to daily-life products (eg cosmetics and abrasive cleaners).
The ubiquity of microplastics (plastic particles < 5 mm, including nanosized plastics < 1 Î¼m) in the global biosphere raises increasing concerns about their implications for human health.
Recent evidence indicates that humans constantly inhale and ingest microplastics; however, whether these contaminants pose a substantial risk to human health is far from understood.
Furthermore, biofilms growing on microplastics may be a source of harmful microorganisms.
A better understanding of the ability of microplastics to cross the epithelial barriers of the airway, gastrointestinal tract, and skin is needed to reduce the current uncertainty in the human risk assessment of microplastics.
My research project aims to determine the effects of these microplastics particles in the development of cancer and oxidative stress.
This project investigates the effects of these microplastics on human cells lines in vitro and whether they play a role in the development of malignancies and metabolic disorders.
I am passionate about science and the environment, particularly, the alarming global production of plastics yearly (approximately 270 million tonnes and the corresponding waste production is around 275 million tonnes) which is a major concern.
Additionally, data has shown that around eight million tonnes of plastic may enter the global water bodies each year and it is estimated that there might be 10,000-100,000 tonnes of plastic in the surface water and even more in greater depths on the seafloor.
Moreover, tap water from 159 global sources was tested and 81% were found to contain microplastics.
The statistics are alarming regarding the quantities of micro and nanoplastics that humans are inhaling, ingesting and exposed to via dermal contact.
Meanwhile, less is known about the toxicity of microplastics in human tissues and organs such as lungs and intestines.
Therefore, I would like to investigate the potential risk of microplastics on human health.
The support at London Met from the research office and my supervisors has been excellent.

Which leadership models work best?
Dr Nidhal Al-Sarraf has been studying just this question with his formidable background in statistical analysis, research and teaching as well as a range of senior leadership roles himself, as part of his recently completed Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) at London Met.
I was born in the "mother of culture" city of Baghdad, in Iraq.
I started my professional career as a statistical researcher in the Organization and Productivity department of The Ministry of Electricity in Iraq, also taking an MSc in Operational Research from the University of Sussex in 1997.
My main duties were to study the practical problems faced by all departments (more than 30,000 employees) â using quantitative techniques to achieve alternative solutions and following up.
In 1981, I moved to the Scientific Office of the Scientific Research Council of Iraq as Head of Researchers until 1991, where I led research staff and committees to study issues in higher education, transportation, industry, agriculture, and other Ministries.
I was also teaching part-time as a lecturer and trainer in various universities and colleges including the Iraqi Engineering Society, Arab Union of Physics and Mathematics, Iraqi Physics and Mathematics Society and the National Center of Planning and Development of Iraq.
In 1992, I left Iraq for the Yemen to work as an assistant lecturer in the University of Taiz, and following that, I joined the HSA Group of Companies (Yemen) as the Head of HR and Executive Manager in the Decisions Support function.
In 1997, I enrolled as a PhD student in economical statistics and cybernetics at the University of Bucharest in Romania.
My thesis title was: âOperational Research Methods for Replacement/Maintenance Strategies in a Group of Industrial Companiesâ, which I completed in 2002.
Since 1999, I've continued working with the HSA Group (Egypt) as a Board Member as well as various organisational and HR roles.
Working with HSA for more than 20 years made me realise that HSA is in a very critical situation, as it's in the maturity stage of its life cycle but is still expanding â and that this family business would be very soon heading towards the decline stage.
My aim as a researcher was to study the impact of leadership on the family business life cycle (considering HSA as the research setting) in order to conclude how to expand the maturity stage of its life cycle before it reaches the exit/decline stage.
Then to think about how to revive the business in order to start a fresh life cycle.
To achieve this, I joined London Met.
My research project was to study the relationship between leadership and family business performance, and to answer my research question: âhow does leadership impact organisational performance in a family business?â considering different leadership styles.
I tested various hypotheses using statistical analysis and different organisational performance measures.
The study chose eight companies as the research setting, with data collected from 588 participants; seventy-six who held leadership roles (top and mid-management levels) were asked to complete a questionnaire that was compared against historical company data.
The results showed a very strong, or strong positive relationship between many of these leadership styles (subscales) and some of the organisational performance measures.
Some of these relationships are statistically significant.
The challenge (to see the funny side) was my age!
When I joined the course, I was around 62 years old â one of my fellow students who also became a friend was 26 years old.
This put me under pressure to work very hard, especially as I continued to lead my work team remotely in Egypt.
My research work makes a significant contribution to knowledge and literature by providing solid empirical evidence about the relationship between each of these three leadership styles (twenty subscales) and the selected organisational performance measures (four measures) â this is the area where a theoretical gap has been identified.
In addition to the theoretical conclusions, the study makes a significant contribution to practitionersâ knowledge, by offering recommendations that are beneficial and practically useful to the HSA Group and any similar company who is in the process of selecting and recruiting new leaders and/or setting up development programs for existing leaders.
The course management, professors and experienced lecturers and staff were very good and helpful.
I was able to achieve one of my dreams â to get a Doctorate, especially in business administration, from the UK.
Completing my course also helped me to establish my private company in management consultation.
The challenge, continued success and solving business problems are my main drivers.
The moment when I received the following email from my supervisor Dr Hazel Messenger after my viva:
âCongratulations 'Dr Dr' Nidhal;)
I heard from the internal examiner and the Chair that they were very satisfied with your thesis and also with the way that you defended the questions.
You should be very proud of yourself...
let the family take you out for dinner!
Best wishes
Hazel

Through academia, I wish to bring subjectivity to those of us who are black, brown and 'other', to humanise our experiences and ways of life, and dismantle notions that it was only the white man who had anything to contribute to rational thought.
Why podcasts?
Anyone who has attempted to enter the media landscape knows how challenging it is for someone of colour to speak their mind and avoid self-censoring.
Podcasts, with their informal distribution channels and low production costs, are an accessible form of media representation and offer an alternative space for marginalised people to convene.
Podcasts are also hosted by people whose lived-experience align in some way with the guest or listener, so they have the opportunity to offer closure to those who've experienced the trauma of racism.

But I have made friends with a few people in the same department whose research interests align well with my own, and I have often sought them out for advice, or just to chat about what we might have learned.
I've also become a member of the Postgraduate Research Society , which has also been a great space to share ideas, to ask questions and to learn about new opportunities.
Both have been lifesaving at times.
How have you found your research supervisors Professors Jenny Harding , Anne Karpf and Peter Lewis ?
Jenny, Anne and Peter are incredibly helpful and so approachable!
I've heard stories of very aloof supervisors, or supervisors who want to direct their PhD candidate's research.
I really have nothing to complain about, because they are very quick to respond and seem genuinely interested in my ideas.

I hope to apply that same curiosity to my PhD and to continue asking students at university questions that don't have easy answers.
My aim is to continue in academia and to become a professor in the field of cultural studies.
I love the diversity of London Met, with students and staff from many backgrounds and walks of life.
I immediately feel at home when I walk into the library or a classroom.
It feels like a safe learning environment, which hasn't always been offered to me.
Join groups of PhD students â they will keep you going when the going gets tough.

By adapting the local vernacular and construction techniques â in conjunction with locally sourced sustainable materials â the proposal is highly replicable along the numerous gutters which run through Freetown.
Because of this, the expansive aim of the proposal was to establish a collection of community halls and markets along the gutters of Freetown.
Establishing them as socially flourishing formalised places of commerce; each with their own retail specialism, run by the women of Sierra Leone.
Freetown, Sierra Leone, is a city that has borne significant physical and institutional changes due to its unique topographical landscape and socio-economic climate.
There is often a disconnect between how these settlements are recorded by the government, international organisations and the residents themselves, with the styles of recording and purposes differing greatly.
My thesis builds on the place-based research carried out to date in Freetownâs neighbourhoods by ARCSR at London Metropolitan University and ASF-UK.
The aims are to understand the matters of most concern to the inhabitants of Freetownâs informal settlements, to examine what the local physical and cultural topography can contribute to address these concerns, and to develop a physical proposal from this.
The main research method will involve extensive first-hand mapping across several scales â from individual homes to the wider city â analysing not only the physical (topographical) of these scales, but also the individual social and ethnographic narratives embedded within them.
These will then be cross referenced with existing contemporary and historical research as narrative involves time.
In order to fully contextualise a singular persona's narrative, one must assess the historical imprint of a location.
It is important that the new maps and narratives produced are not only observations detailed by an âoutsiderâ, but also authentic recordings of the observations and experience of local residents of all ages, gender and abilities.
Empirical research will include map-making participatory workshops within particular transitional settlements as the primary forum for narrative exchange.
The aim will be to host at least four workshops each in two distinct settlements: one workshop with important community leaders representing different parts of their communities; one workshop inviting any adult wish to participate regardless of their gender, abilities and social role; and two following workshops with children.
These settings are chosen not only to produce new primary data but also to encourage local social ownership of that data.
In addition to promoting urban equality by giving the local residents ownership of the outcomes developed through the workshops.
The expected output of this thesis is the provision of a mapping toolkit for the settlements, their governments and potential NGO initiatives combining cartography, architecture, ethnography and indigenous narratives to inform, imagine and represent community-led action plans at the local and city scales.
In addition to this, the hope is that I will be able to co-design with children in Freetown a set of satellite proposals that can be implemented across several sites in the city.
Professor Maurice Mitchell and Dr Bo Tang I have known for some time now; they were my Part 2 tutors at London Met, and a big part of why I chose to do a PhD at London Met.
And having the perspective of Dr Beatrice De Carli â who has an abundance of on-ground experience in Freetown â has been vital to how Iâve began to approach possible future workshops in Freetown.
It is probably clichÃ© to say that architecture â and therefore my career â is my biggest passion in life, however I have always wanted my career to be something I enjoy.
I have always enjoyed both highly academic and highly artists subjects, and architecture is both of those.
It is a passion where I am able to both think methodically, and also embrace my creativity.
I believe that my current achievements are not the ceiling of what I can achieve in general.
As soon as I achieve a goal, I have proven to myself that I am capable of achieving more, and that is then what I set out to do.
There are a few moments that come to mind, however I think the main one would be graduating from my masterâs degree.
My parents sacrificed a great amount to relocate to the UK, and I am glad I have been able to make the most of every academic and career opportunity I have been blessed with.
I am of the first generation in my family to have gone to university, and the first person in my family to acquire a master's degree.
My current goal is to successfully complete my PhD.
Further from this I hope to complete the architecture accreditation process, in order to become a fully qualified architect.
I wish to expand my knowledge and practice to sufficiently be able to design in difficult economic regions, with a focus on humanitarian-driven bottoms-up architecture.
I hope to establish an architecture firm where I am able to combine both research and practice; as I believe that the two donât solely belong to either the realm of academia or occupation respectively.
My favourite space at London Met would probably be the Unit studio spaces.
It is a highly time-consuming course and being able to work alongside your peers â especially near to critical deadlines â is so incredibly beneficial.
It is something that has been denied to some recent architecture students due to current events.
My biggest advice to any architecture student, whether undergraduate or postgraduate, would be to make the most out of their studio space and to work in unison with their peers when they can.
In my first year of my masterâs degree I was a member of the School of AADâs resident Architecture Society.
I wholeheartedly recommend the experience.
Not only was I able to meet architecture students from different units and year groups, it was also a way to participate in academic and practical discourse in a socially driven and non-curricular way.
Make the most out of resources available to you.
London Met has an amazing library team, and the School of Art, Architecture and Design in particular has many great workshop spaces that are available to students.
This also includes clubs and societies; higher education can seem daunting at times, but having connections to like-minded people at the same university as you makes for a great support system.
"My parents sacrificed a great amount to relocate to the UK, and I am glad I have been able to make the most of every academic and career opportunity I have been blessed with.

If the use of chemicals as weapons of war fills you with horror, then youâre not alone.
Meet Olivia Ibbotson , whose unusual journey through life has led her to a PhD at London Met that tackles the international criminalization of biological and chemical weapons.
I used to coach gymnastics throughout my youth â and then I stopped coaching when I was about 18.
Throughout my GCSEs and A levels my academic interests mostly focused on politics â I was very very vocal as a teenager â and I was a big feminist.
I remember being in one of my first sociology classes and a question was, whoâs a feminist?
I was probably one of the only people to raise my hand.
Until the end of the year â then everyone raised their hand because they understood what a feminist was.
I was very into politics at that age and still am now, although I undertook my bachelorâs in the life sciences.
I've always been interested in science â when I was little, I was always the person to question why why why.
I was also interested in military and medical history â particularly when I did a project on Vietnam in Secondary school.
We did a module on biological and chemical weapons which was the first time I had been introduced to the subject, which is actually linked my current PhD research.
I had quite an untraditional route into getting into Biomedical Science.
I originally took my A levels in Government and Politics, Sociology and Psychology.
I had to take a foundation year first â so I originally came to London Met to study Forensic Science .
I fell in love with the biomedical aspect of it, and so I worked very very hard to make up for the fact that I didn't have science A levels.
I managed to switch courses into Biomedical Science and my first two years were pretty much online because of COVID.
I studied at home which was great because I had all the opportunity in the world to study.
My favourite part of my degree was an infection control module taught by Ian Hancock â we went from A-Z on how to manage infections and how to prevent them, and all the different steps.
In my third year I got to undertake my dissertation project (Supervisor â Cassandra Terry ) which I loved â I studied protein misfolding disorders and my project was entitled âReplicating Hens Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL) fibril formation in vitro using fluorescent spectrometry as a way to screen natural compounds as potential therapeutics for protein misfolding disordersâ.
I used HEWL to imitate the human brain cells and put it into different conditions to try and initiate misfolding.
I then used natural compounds to try and reverse or prevent it from misfolding.
I used compounds derived from red wine and green tea, which revealed quite promising results.
Because I spent my first two years online, I was quite nervous to go into the Superlab .
But I got the best training and was very comfortable quite early on, especially with undertaking my dissertation in the lab â I got a lot of hands-experience working alone and in partnership.
Unfortunately, COVID meant a lot of institutions stopped placements.
I emailed NHS labs, pathology labs, mortuaries â I sent a million emails.
I did volunteer in a high school in my second and third years as a science technician.
I worked with another technician, and we set up lab practicalâs for students from year 10 to year 13.
I also helped do a little bit of teaching in these classes.
Most of my work was focused on health and safety, so doing auditing for chemicals.
At the end of the year, you have to write exactly what chemicals you have and how much is in them and sort out the wastage, so I got very good hands-on experience.
I do still pop back to school semi regularly as well â I developed a very good working relationship with the science technician.
I've always wanted to do a PhD â I've always been interested in research.
I'm an avid reader.
I love writing, I love words, I like writing essays â so I always knew that I wanted to turn it into a career in academia, but it was the Biological Security Research Centre here that sparked my interest.
I was looking up biological security on the internet and at different PhD options and I saw that we had a Centre here which was perfect for me.
I had a meeting with Professor Lijun Shang who is the director.
We began talking about different ideas â and that's how I fell into the PhD route.
I have an excellent supervision team with Professor Lijun Shang who provides both life and social science experience, Professor Don MacRaild who is an historian, and Professor Malcolm Dando, from Bradford University, who originally trained in Biology but has spent his career researching international security focusing on chemical and biological weapons (particularly bio-neurological weapons).
As such, I have a very very good, wise supervision team â interdisciplinary as well.
The research that I'm doing does not necessarily fall into one subject category â say if I have a chemical, I have to look at it from every perspective â politics, international relations, economics etcâ¦ â every sort of subject fits into it, which has been very interesting, but also a challenge.
I had to spend my first year pretty much learning every international law and convention â but that was also fun.
I would like greater public awareness in general, and more discussions within the international community.
For example, there's a chemical that I've been doing quite a lot of research on the moment that isn't actually covered under any of the weapons or arms control laws, but about 10 years ago did get quite a lot of attention.
It has inconsistent attention from NGOs (non-governmental organisations) since, but not much in the international community â so I would like to bring a little bit of campaigning into getting these chemicals spoken about and just greater conversations about these weapons and the harm, research concerns and risks there that arise with them.
At the moment, we have so many different risk factors that we're facing in the 21st century â climate change, a rise in AI, in addition to how incredibly unstable international politics is creates and nurtures a honeypot for these sorts of things.
For example, as a result of climate change, there are various plant and zoonotic diseases that have arisen in Europe.
I was reading the other day about Black Stem Rust â climate change has affected the jet streams which has led to rise in Black Stem Rust in Western Europe.
I think it is just a very relevant, prominent subject.
Theyâve been excellent â I cannot fault the guidance and the help I have been given.
I have invaluable members of my supervision team, and I have spoken to PhD students from different universities and their experience is not the same as mine.
I pretty much have all the resources I need to complete my research.
I could ask my supervisors any question and I would never be made to feel as though I was being a âsilly PhD studentâ or a young researcher.
I have had so much support and mentorship.
I feel like I am really being guided into a well-crafted career and Iâm so grateful.
I always say to my friends and family it's like I've won the lottery â I get to study and research exactly what I want with invaluable help and mentorship â it is excellent.
Curiosity, I would probably say.
Iâve always been very very curious and wanting to know why and the thoughts behind things.
From my research particularly, I think we can bring around real change â and so I think that's also what drives me.
I get to study real-life situations that are currently happening and apply my own research to it.
The chemical that I've been researching to campaign that it's inhumane or should be made illegal â that is affecting people's lives now and has done for years.
It isn't a pleasant topic and it can be emotionally quite difficult.
I could spend a whole day researching the human effects that these chemicals have on people â from severe burns to birth defects 20 years down the line.
It is also quite politically sensitive, so I also have to think on how I'm presenting my work and how I'm researching, if there's any of my own bias or any other bias in my research.
Am I only looking at Western documents, or am I looking at documents from different regions of the world?
How I am viewing the big picture?
(not just through a narrow angle).
I think that is probably what drives me â that I can fully dive into this topic and try to find answers to these questions that seem to be neglected.
Particularly where you can see the real life consequences of these chemicals, whether that be in the land or humans.
The most challenging thing for me has been public speaking.
I've always been quite a nervous public speaker, so my goal for my first year of my PhD was to get comfortable at public speaking, as thatâs something that will be part of my career.
In my first year I signed up for as many conferences and public speaking as possible.
I memorised every single word I was going to say â and even when I was going to breathe!
At the London Metropolitan University Past, Present and Future conference, that is probably the proudest I have been.
I lost sleep about the speeches for months and from the second I submitted my abstract it'd been looming over me.
The fact that I managed to successfully complete those talks and win some prizes as well was a great personal (and academic) achievement for me.
I won first prize for the lightning talk and then first prize for a recorded presentation I did as well â that was very good because I was so incredibly nervous, and I don't actually have any memories of being on stage at all!
I also learnt a lot about myself â I found that I actually find it easier to answer questions on stage than I do presenting work, which is probably because I don't have much time to think about it when I'm answering questions.
Yes â originally when I started my PhD I was working in a bar and then in 2024 and I became a research assistant for the Biological Security Research Centre, and Iâve been helping on a British Academy-funded research project on biosecurity in agribusiness.
I've been working with Professor Lijun Shang developing research materials for a Horizon Europe bid.
My research has been focusing on biosecurity and its education within animals, plants and the environment.
I have also been assisting on a separate project called the International Biological Security Education Network (IBSEN ).
IBSEN is developing an international network of scientists, academics and various other experts in the field of biosecurity education.
In the first part of 2024 I also did some teaching as an associate lecturer.
Itâs great experience and life skills and youâre learning when youâre teaching.
My favourite place is the PhD office â it's where I complete my research and it's my favourite place firstly because it's like a nice safe little area for me to do my work so I can just put my headphones on and research from one hour to eight hours and itâll go in the blink of an eye.
Secondly because of all the students and staff who are in the office â they are all very welcoming.
I was quite nervous to go into the office â I didn't know how I'd be received, but I was received with open arms and everyone's very friendly and lovely and very supportive as well.
If I have any questions, theyâre more than happy to answer.
Probably my main interest outside of university is reading â I am an avid reader, I have been since I was quite young.
I read quite varied literature ranging from non-fiction to the classics to fantasy and science fiction.
My favourite classic is A Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde and another favourite book which isn't a classic but I imagine probably will be eventually is The Secret History by Donna Tartt.
A very good science fiction read that I just finished was The Ferryman by Justin Cronin which was excellent.
I would like a career in academia â I enjoy researching, I enjoy writing so I would like to continue with research, and perhaps lead on to teaching.
Professor Lijun Shang has provided invaluable guidance in regards to teaching, whether that be with marking or how to explain different concepts to students.
Whether you do five minutes or two hoursâ worth of research, itâs worth it.
If you have a day where you feel as though you can't physically research any longer, five minutes is better than nothing.
Normally five minutes is just enough to get you back into your research and interested again.

My research will look specifically at Asian, African and Caribbean heritage care-experienced children and young people.
We know children from all races and ethnicities experience sexual abuse.
However, research tells us Asian, African and Caribbean heritage children experience additional barriers to accessing adequate support and are less likely to disclose to professionals.
The majority of research in this area is from adults looking at historical abuse.
Research and practice show us that children and young people do talk, and want opportunities to talk about their own lives in their own words.
I have a passion for young people and their voices being heard.
From a social care perspective I think there is still a lot that practitioners can learn from listening to children and young people.
Social care as an institute is embedded in Eurocentric assessments and processes that do not always ensure good outcomes for Black, Asian and other racially minoritised families.
We need to critically evaluate those areas of weakness and find practical ways to address them.
I hope we as practitioners can have a better understanding of ways to adequately address sexual abuse in those families.
Not having structured classes and assignments has been a big change for me and I work well into routines.

I was a single teenage mother and things have not always been easy but with the right support and belief, anything is possible.
So many people have inspired and encouraged me.
I feel like I am meant to say getting a scholarship and starting my PhD.
But in fact, it would be my son getting to the third year of his Criminology degree.
Being at the same university is nice, studying at home and learning from and with him has been cool, but I think he would likely disagree with that.
As part of my scholarship , I am only allowed to work part-time and I work for a great 'by and for' organisation, which aligns with my values and also has links to my PhD research.
My manager is supportive so I have some flexibility around uni events.
I also access clinical supervision through work which is a great space to debrief and reflect.

By carrying out research with children and young people I want more research to be centred around childrenâs voices when focusing on the harm that children face.
It is important for me that when professionals talk about good practice, and we see this documented in reports, to understand how this equates to positive outcomes for the children and young people we support.
Who is judging this as good practice, do the professionals and children perceive this to be the same?
I would want the research to be purposeful for children, young people and Local Authority practice.
I still enjoy frontline work and I hope to facilitate reflective practice workshops from the research findings.

Initially working in mental health, Dr Ava Kanyeredzi undertook a PhD at London Met examining issues faced by African and Caribbean heritage victim-survivors of violence/abuse.
She is now a published author, researcher and lecturer, and the University welcomes her back from time to time as a guest lecturer.
She is also active within the Black Church Domestic Abuse Forum â where Dr Kanyeredzi and her team provide domestic abuse resources for church leaders.
Initially I wanted to research the role of child abuse or domestic violence in mental distress and looked for institutions offering opportunities.
When I found the Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit (CWASU) at London Met were offering the PhD as part of the Vice-Chancellor’s Scholarships , I thought, given my research interests, studying in a specialised research unit would be the perfect fit.
I was excited by the opportunity to learn more about research at CWASU and possibly get involved in projects there.
I was also thrilled to return to London Met, my alma mater, where I studied my undergraduate when it was the University of North London.
I took modules in Research Methods, Woman and Child Abuse and Life History Research.
I found the lecturers knowledgeable and passionate about their subjects and delivered in an accessible and intellectually stimulating style with lots of lively student discussions.
On the Woman and Child Abuse MA modules, I studied with practitioners from a range of backgrounds and with peers from my cohort.
This made the experience even richer and informed my methodological approach.
I was in Ladbroke Grove to begin with and had always loved the architecture of the building, the familiarity of the corridors, library, student spaces where I spent so much time during my undergraduate degree.
This made me feel ready for the challenge of undertaking my PhD.
When we moved over to the Holloway Road campus, I was crestfallen to begin with.
However, the familiarity and homeliness that was and is still present at the Holloway Road campus soon distracted from this loss: the welcoming smells of the meals being prepared in the canteen, the bustle and flow of students through the entrance.
I always pause at the entrance when I return to reflect on memories of conferences and events in the Henry Thomas Room and again the feeling of familiarity and sense of home that I experience there when I am there.
I love the fusion of the old and new interiors in Holloway Road campus and that there is always somewhere to sit.
The vibrant research culture is present everywhere you go in London Met, more noticeable from the posters in the corridors and the regular talks presented, many of which I attended during my PhD.
I also got the opportunity to work on research projects at CWASU, to publish work whilst there.
Initially, my plan was to become a clinical psychologist, but during my Graduate Diploma studies I became interested in the psychosocial aspects of mental distress.
More specifically, I was working as a healthcare assistant in a medium secure forensic psychiatric unit and wanted to understand peopleâs routes into these services.
There was a lot of child abuse in patientsâ background histories, but they became known to services through perpetrating violence/abuse.
The racialised and socioeconomic disparities within patientsâ lives are impossible to ignore when working in mental health services.
Through literature searches I identified an absence in studies across the board about Black British womenâs lived experiences and about sexual violence/mental distress in particular.
I conducted research with 15 women, seven practitioners and nine as victim-survivors.
I also used visual methods photo-elicitation and photo production in life history interviews.
Research carried out in the USA has showed that poverty, disadvantage, needing support with so much more than domestic violence and abuse places African American women outside the remit of refuges in some states.
African-American women carry the legacies and burdens of what Patricia Hill Collins terms "controlling images" about Black women â that they are strong, invulnerable, can manage more by themselves, are too sexy to be raped, loud, aggressive and emasculating.
I found that Black British women victim-survivors of child sexual abuse/domestic abuse do also carry these controlling images of being a "single mother", "less attractive", and they are very much aware that these images are used to judge and disregard them.
They hold these images in constant consideration and in decisions to seek help and support.
Their responses can include staying silent about experiences and adopting a "strong Black woman" persona to cope.
Seeking help and support means having the trust to reach out.
This may be too much for women who have experienced systems, services and the people who represent them as hostile and discriminatory.
This hostility within their everyday exchanges, in places of employment, study and public spaces, influence them to be hyper-vigilant, leaving them feeling judged and unheard.
The research has raised the issues of how race, gender and experiences of violence/abuse intersect in Black British womenâs lives and has been cited in policy documents on the experience and needs of minoritised British victim-survivors.
I am regularly invited to present keynotes at academic, health, policy and practitioner events.
I also annually return to London Met on the CWASUâs Woman and Child Abuse MA to deliver a guest lecture on my research.
I thoroughly enjoyed my PhD experience.
It gave me the space, time and opportunity to read and reflect on violence/abuse research, feminist/Black feminist theories and their relevance to Black British victim-survivors of violence/abuse.
I enjoyed having peers within the same unit and our many debates and discussions.
To be honest, during the PhD I thought little about what I would do when it ended.
The most enjoyable aspect of my time at London Met was further developing my research skills, being sensitised to womenâs words and all of the embodied ways in which violence/abuse and oppressions impact their lives.
My PhD supervision by Prof Liz Kelly , Dr Maddy Coy and Prof Jenny Harding enabled me to shift my thinking and understanding of the topic and to reflect on the complexities of womenâs lives in my writing.
As a lecturer, I strive to create that careful, compassionate nurturing and containment that I received at London Met to enable students to produce their best work.
I was pleasantly surprised by the sense of community within London Met that made me feel that I belonged and welcomed.
That has not changed since I first studied here.
The book presents in-depth issues for African and Caribbean heritage victim-survivors of violence/abuse and is the direct result of my PhD research.
It focusses on themes from interviews with African and Caribbean heritage women victim-survivors of violence/abuse.
The book documents the forms of abuse they experienced: child sexual abuse, multiple-perpetrator rape, emotional abuse and neglect, domestic violence.
Some had experienced many forms across their life-course, most were abused in childhood.
In addition, women offered how forms of abuse were racialised, derogatory comments about their hair texture/hairstyles, skin complexion, feeling racialised in public spaces, leaving a sense of not belonging â even though all were British citizens.
Those who perpetrated abuse were mostly men they knew who exploited access to the women as children.
Women were also physically and emotionally abused and neglected by mothers.
Developing on Liz Kellyâs sexual violence continuum, I conceptualised the many forms of abuse/violence women experience as a "continuum of oppression".
Women were at first silenced by family members as children, leaving them the burden of reflecting on what had happened and the costs of speaking.
Two women who had experienced domestic violence lost custody of their children to their abusive partners.
The book is useful for practitioners/researchers/students who have found it invaluable in understanding the sociocultural contexts UK for Black British women victim/survivors.
I am the research/evaluation lead for this collaboration of practitioners, theologians, academics, church leaders, lawyer, journalist, victim/survivors, convened in 2016 to provide domestic abuse resources for church leaders.
We have developed a training toolkit called Walk in the Way of Love, to enable church leaders to better respond to churchgoers who report domestic abuse.
The BCDAF works primarily with Black Majority churches (BMCs).
BMCs are churches of any denomination where congregants are mostly people of African or Caribbean heritage.
BMCs have more than 100-year history, from their origins in Southwark in 1906 with over 500,000 in membership.
BMCs are essential as spaces of safety, solace, education, employment and immigration support, fellowship, family, belonging and spiritual uplift.
BMCs are under-researched especially on domestic abuse.
I am currently carrying out research funded by a BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grant to investigate awareness and understandings of domestic abuse within BMCs.
This will include focus groups and interviews with BMC church leaders and churchgoers on their experiences of reporting or supporting domestic abuse.
Find out more about this research
One of the findings from my PhD research was that faith/spirituality was important for all of the women I interviewed.
I did not ask about their faith.
Women shared photographs of church spaces that made them feel connected, were able to weep without question and I was interested in how these spaces could be more responsive to victim-survivors of child abuse or domestic violence.
After I completed my PhD, I was connected to this collective.
I was initially interested in church/faith spaces for victim-survivors but the BCDAF became so much more.
I have learned so much about the process of working collaboratively on shared goals from diverse perspectives and producing outcomes.
We hosted a very successful official launch event in January 2021 that was attended by 170 delegates with keynotes from church leaders and the now Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales.
The event has further enabled us to connect with a wider network of individuals and projects doing similar work in faith communities.
The BCDAF is also a member of the Faith and Violence Against Women coalition.
It was challenging at first to work at the pace of the collaboration that felt too slow.
It took us a number of years and many deliberations to agree the resources and strategies for our target communities.
Through this process I learned that the complexity of the issues that involve working with groups that are marginalised and feel under public scrutiny, yet still want to support victim-survivors, requires careful consideration and slow scholarship and collaboration.
It is difficult to not feel part of something greater than my research interests because of the current cultural, historical and political contexts.
More public debate about the intersections of race/gender oppressions including lived experiences of violence/abuse benefits my research in terms of awareness and applications for funding.
However, there remains the challenge of always me still having to highlight that violence/abuse is no more prevalent in minoritised or Black communities; rather, people face more challenges in seeking support for a range of complex reasons.
This informs me that more work is required to dismantle racist/racialised controlling images about minoritised communities.
There should be more attention paid in policy and practice to intersecting inequities that can be replicated in the very spaces where minoritised women seek support.
More work should be done to diversify images and case studies of victimisation so that all victim-survivors feel more enabled to seek support.
Within communities and families, more conversations about sexual consent, violence/abuse could reinforce the importance of these for men/women/children.
I am excited by the work we are doing in the BCDAF with church communities as this can enable people to seek support in spaces where they already feel safe to do so.
Remote/online learning/teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled me to connect with students in ways that are a more flexible and convenient for them, some of this I wish to continue doing post pandemic.
My work has felt more challenging and exhausting during the pandemic, especially when schools were closed.
I have also been managing with a few physical health challenges and am one of those for whom the pandemic delayed medical interventions.
However, I have also felt most productive during this period, albeit with limited physical capacity.
All of the political movements during the pandemic have amplified our societiesâ inequities.
This has meant for church communities, the issue of domestic abuse.
Covid made our work at the BCDAF easier as people are now more aware of domestic abuse.
It was easier and more convenient for us to deliver domestic abuse training online during the lockdowns.
I was a member of the African-Caribbean society during my first degree.
I enjoyed meeting people from different regions in the UK, Africa and the Caribbean via the society and to learn about their lives and experiences of race/racisms.
I remember one of our members gave a presentation on the Biafran war, that until then I was completely unaware of.
Please jump in, it will be one of the most memorable, challenging, humbling and transformational experiences of your life.
You will learn heaps about your topic and yourself during the process.
London Met for me was the most welcoming and supportive places to pursue a PhD.
"The vibrant research culture is present everywhere you go in London Met, more noticeable from the posters in the corridors and the regular talks presented, many of which I attended during my PhD.
I also got the opportunity to work on research projects and to publish work whilst there."

If you have diabetes, you could find yourself pricking your skin over 700 times a year to measure your glucose levels, notes London Met PhD researcher and lecturer Renu .
Renu is working on a non-invasive sensor solution to this issue, and has come up with some unusual ways to keep himself motivatedâ¦
I was born and brought up in a city in south India, so Iâm used to a city lifestyle.
Most of my schooling was in India, and I started my undergraduate degree in robotics in India but towards the end I had an opportunity to go to New York â so I was a researcher over there, and thatâs where I developed an interest in doing a PhD.
I then did a masterâs in robotics at the University of Bristol, and went back to India when Covid hit, and worked in the automation sector for a while.
I started to apply for PhDs and write to supervisors, and when Professor Bal Virdee replied, I knew he was going to take good care of me â rather than just saying send me your CV or your grades, it was more about what do you want to do and what we can offer, how we can guide you.
So that was one of the important reasons why I chose London Met.
My PhD is in electronics, more specifically, biosensors.
Weâre working on a sensor thatâs trying to calculate your glucose levels through non-invasive means.
Youâve probably seen other methods where you prick your body to measure your glucose levels, mostly intended to help people with diabetes.
With our device, weâre intending that you just place it on your hand and it measures your levels from that.
Thereâs much more testing and datasets needed first but hopefully weâre pushing the boundaries.
We had encouraging results from experiments with artificial solutions and published these.
We have a collaboration with one of the biggest hospitals in India â they have around 1,000 beds.
Last December we went over there to do some clinical trials but it was a humbling experience.
It actually proved to us that human bodies are way more complicated and you have to put in more effort â so it helped myself and Innocent (whoâs also working on a hydration sensor in the project).
I work more on the programming and classification parts and he works on the hardware parts and design.
Whenever weâve required funding or specialist equipment, London Metâs tried their hardest to accommodate that.
They sponsored us for the trip to India and they have helped us a lot.
We still have a contract with the hospital and weâre able to extend that to continue our research which is a good thing for the University, and means that we have good contacts there for any future projects and clinical trials.
If you have diabetes, often youâll have to prick yourself twice a day, thatâs 720 times a year.
Thatâs hard if you have dry skin, and you might get exposed to germs.
Thereâs also a lot of biomedical waste with the plastic strips that are used.

If Iâm a bit stressed, watching a match just gives me that mental space that I need â even if we win or lose.
I was told that a PhD is a little like a marriage â you get these lovely moments like butterflies in your stomach when things are going your way â but you never know when the happy moments are going to come.
Or the frustrating moments too!
For me, writing papers is the boring, stressful part, and research is the exciting part â and having those Arsenal games to watch helps me.
When we went to India, we were confident we had a solution, but the results were completely different to what we expected, and that was very challenging.
Research is like a gold mine â you just keep digging to find the gold but you donât know where exactly it is.
When you donât find it and youâre getting lost, thatâs when your supervisorâs there to help you try digging in a different area.
The other challenging part for me is managing time, because I teach here full-time and my research is part-time.
A lot of lecturers are going through the same thing â theyâre doing their PhDs as well, so itâs good that we have this community.
My supervisorâs been great.
The support comes also from the Research and Postgraduate Office â they keep organising courses for us, like thesis writing classes every week, and make sure we have a proper PhD community.
We have a WhatsApp group where we try to help each other.
Even students whoâve completed their PhDs are still in the group because they want to help.
Getting a PhDâs a beautiful feeling â thatâs what they say.
Hopefully Iâll get that as well!
Itâs a really good community that we have at London Met.

Anastasiya Kichigina successfully completed her PhD in Public Administration and Governance as well as a master's programme and most recently, a Postgraduate Certificate in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education at London Metropolitan University.
Now Senior Research Programme Manager at NIHR (the National Institute for Health Research), Dr Kichigina has also guest lectured at University College London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and London Metropolitan University where she has taught students on project management, international development and public management modules.
Anastasiya has also worked as a Project Manager on the FCO Human Rights and Democracy Programme, aiming to make a difference to peopleâs lives, and helping to build infrastructures for governments and civil society to promote and protect human rights.
âNot everyone in my administration is fortunate enough to have the ability to study abroad.
Therefore, I took the challenge to go abroad and gain expertise in the international practice of public administration to bring this back to my region so I would be able to implement changes that will seriously improve our standards of services for our residents.â
Anastasiya took a one-year sabbatical with the full support of her government and managed to secure the Ford Foundation International Fellowship Programme, a highly competitive scholarship covering all tuition fees, living expenses and flights.
Anastasiya was given one year to find a suitable course and she researched various appropriate courses for her professional needs.
She learnt from reading London Met's student profiles that many people had come from developing countries to study the course and returned home to implement policies for social change.
The final deciding factor was the work placement module, something that could prove extremely informative and expose her to real-life situations and examples of managing public services under international standards.
âMy purpose in studying abroad was my wish to gain useful knowledge in order to implement what I had learnt and train staff back in my home administration.â
âThe work placement module was extremely rewarding and informative.
I worked at the London Borough of Havering in Romford and this team is very similar to the one I managed back home.
I had a chance to participate in all seminars and meetings with the service providers.
I also had a chance to experience first-hand the theories we had learned in the classroom; in particular, the implementation of outcome-based accountability.
This approach is not yet used in Russia; however, I have started to implement this to raise our standard of quality to ensure that we are held accountable and seen to be learning and improving from past experience.â
On graduation, Anastasiya returned to Russia to develop and implement a large-scale strategy and a long-term development programme.
A year on from this work, Anastasiya decided to further her research into this area and applied for a PhD at London Met.
She received a VC Scholarship to study a PhD in performance management and the challenges of implementing performance management system to the Russian Social Services, using Krasnoyarsk as a case study.

"If I'm not careful I do get a bit too lost in PhD-theory-history-research-isolation-mode", notes Reishin, one of the University's VC Scholarship students who's undertaking research into architecture and decolonialisation.
Find out how Reishin tackles this issue common to many PhD students, and what impact Reishin is hoping this research will have in the wider architectural world.
After graduating my bachelor's in architecture at Cardiff University, I spent some time working at my family's Japanese restaurant in Finchley Central while trying to find a job in the field.
I was lucky enough to find an intern job working for an architectural design office in New York, where I worked on cultural competitions and showroom projects.
I then moved into a short career as a design manager in modular construction.
This was on international projects across North America, Europe and Asia, but I specialised on modular housing projects in urban seismic zones.
I wanted to use my experience on my own projects so later decided to complete a master's degree in architecture at the Architectural Association.
At the AA I was able to explore more ideas about the architect's agency and its entanglement with colonial structures.
Around this time I was also balancing part-time work in an architecture office, family restaurant and organising work with groups like the architectural workers union, SAW.
Using decolonial theory, my final master's project culminated in a video essay on the entanglement between architectural practice, history and institutional building material.
When I was on the lookout for PhD opportunities around my interests in architectural practice and decolonisation, I was quite worried that it wouldn't be possible.
It seemed to me that there weren't many supervisors or funding streams that would fit the kind of research I wanted to do.
So when I saw the call for applications for the VC scholarship which aligned perfectly to my research interests I felt really excited and lucky.
Funding is very rare and especially so for architecture and decolonial study so I jumped at the chance.
I was also impressed with the University's acknowledgements towards decolonial justice and commitments to fund research around social justice.
I was also intrigued by how this could fold into the School's Art, Architecture and Design department as an interdisciplinary setting.
Sure thing!
I'm interested into the historical events around a government policy document, the Warne report, which in 1993 recommended to abolish the legally protected title of the architect.
Architects at the time responded in shock and anger at the time, critiquing it as part of the conservative government's unjust deregulation agenda.
When I look at the contents of the report however, I find its provocation a worthwhile challenge to consider.
Perhaps, as it recommends, the abolition of title might free the profession from its ideological challenges?
I'm quite interested in how the cultural issues like professional elitism, alluded to in the report and anecdotally known by practioners, relate to architectural practice.
I'm inspired by the work of Stuart Hall in seeing this a structure of whitenness and I attempt to untangle the architect's historical construction as a male, aristocratic, white power figure.
Like many decolonial, queer and feminist authors, I'm interested in seeing if the interruption of these structures may lead to other ways to be, know and practice.
Not many people are aware of the historical events or signficance of the Warne report.
I think it's quite helpful context for a lot of architectural practioners today and more widely in professional studies.
I also think that a decolonial approach to architectural professional history is understudied and valuable work.
I hope that it might ask academics, educators and practioners ways to think about a different form of architectural practice.
I love doing my research but I have found the lifestyle change quite challenging.
PhD comes with a lot of freedom but this can be lonely and hard to balance if you crave structure.
I've been trying to contribute to and enrich the postgraduate community and space.
It's really helped my research and experience.
Talking to your peers about research and research life is so valuable!
I really love working with my supervisors, Dr Jessica Kelly and Dr Claire Jamieson !
They understand the positionality of my research and push me to stay focused.
I value their feedback and enjoy feeling like I'm in a kind of research team with them.
For example, I'm co-organising a symposium with one of my supervisors in September, and really looking forward to how it will unfold.
My supervisors' work is also really interesting and they're also empathetic supervisors.
I feel very blessed with this match!
I think I grew up internalising a lot of structural injustice around me, and as I got older, became more conscious about how it was all connected.
I'm very passionate to work towards a world that might be kinder and braver than it was yesterday.
That the struggles I've faced, or my family's, or my peers, might be made obsolete in the future.
I think it's really important to recognise the privledged position I'm in and use that to nourish others.
I use that motivation to pursue research as an intervention and hope that it might one day empower someone else.
When someone says 'your work really moved me', or 'I felt seen', or 'what do we do now?' I feel particularly inspired and that keeps me going.
Well, probably getting accepted as a VC scholar!
But I suppose it was highly influenced by my final master's project , and that's something I'm very proud of.
I feel that it was a precursor to a lot of my current PhD research but also a culmination of my technical skills in architecture, theory, visual media and political expression.
It was also a nice a moment because I could really incorporate so many parts of myself, and it was also the first time I centred myself in my work.
Which is both terrifying but also empowering.
It also represented almost ten years of architectural training so that was signficant.
Mostly I'm really proud of how many people have watched the video or engaged in the work and told me how much it resonated and connected with them.
I do pick up some freelance work every now and then.
Sometimes it's a restaurant shift, helping on some research admin, community engagement or teaching.
It is challenging to fit into my studies to be honest, and I'm trying to get better at balancing my life..!
But I've also found that I enjoy working alongside study and it does have positive mental health impacts for me.
If I'm not careful I do get a bit too lost in PhD-theory-history-research-isolation-mode.
I try to pace myself and pick up work that aligns to the research I'm doing already.
Luckily with the VC scholarship and a supportive community around me I can afford to be a bit picky about that.
I've used the counselling service.
It's great!
Shoutout to Sejal.
It's a great resource and as a student, amazing to receive for free.
Talking to a professional is really valuable and helps keep me feeling like my best self.
So it feeds the research as well.
I'm very active in the architect's union, the Section of Architectural Workers (SAW) as a branch of Unite the Union.
I think it's important to back up the theory and intention of justice work with grassroots organising.
It's an amazing community and forum to test a lot of the ideas I'm grappling with.
It's important work but it also feels good to help people find a voice and agency in their workplace.
I also enjoy being part of something bigger than me and explore what it means to organise collaboratively.
What a question!
One of the challenges I've had in PhD is trying to make the research very focused.
I can get very passionate and interested about so many different things, so I'd love to be able to pick up some of my many research interests after PhD.
So I suppose it will be amazing to find a place or position to keep my research going, both for myself but also in ways that engage with others.
I'd love to be able to keep researching, writing and doing some teaching, like many other decolonial authors who have inspired me.
Of course the support I get through the VC scholarship already helps a lot and building networks through the University will really help me with these goals.
Seek out community!
It makes you feel better and it strengthens your work.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/profiles/students/greg-lessons:
A firefighter for almost 20 years, Greg Lessons became concerned by obesity levels amongst UK firefighters and the knock-on effects â such as heart attacks, diabetes and other preventable health conditions â especially with the extreme temperatures that firefighters are exposed to.
After completing his Human Nutrition (Public Health/Sports) MSc at London Met, Greg worked as a nutritionist for the London Fire Brigade, where he completed his PhD in Human Nutrition (Public Health) whilst implementing his research in the real world â and the results were impressive.
Greg now works as Health Improvement Lead in a newly created role at the Fire Fighters Charity (FFC), where he's involved in empowering firefighters and FFC beneficiaries to improve and maintain their own health through educational resources and interventions.
Even though he's successfully completed his PhD, he continues to collaborate with London Met's Public Health Nutrition (PHN) Research Group â the research group will be helping to measure and assess the real-world results of his FFC work.
Greg has acquired a growing number of awards, including the Health and Nutrition Award in the Public Sector Catering Awards 2020 (for improving the unhealthy food environment which is characteristic of fire stations) as well as Nutritionist of the Year at the Caroline Walker Trust awards 2019.
He has also appeared on the BBC to talk about firefighter nutrition.
Seventeen years of public service as a firefighter alerted me to a culture of overnutrition at fire stations.
Only one previous UK study had quantified the prevalence of overweight and obesity levels in a county fire brigade (66%).
Other recent research has placed firefighters at elevated risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks caused by exposure to excessive heat whilst fighting fires.
It therefore became obvious to me that the modifiable risk factors of being overweight and obese must be addressed.
This however had been overlooked by UK researchers.
To our knowledge, my study was the first in the UK to deliver a worksite nutrition-based intervention for firefighters, to improve health and reduce obesity.
My multi-component intervention involved a face-to-face dietary, physical activity and lifestyle education programme alongside the environmental modification of obesogenic fire stations.
My one-month pilot trial significantly lowered BMI, body fat percentage, total energy intake, and several other key dietary variables for the intervention station firefighters, four of whom crossed over into more favourable waist circumference risk classifications.
This significantly reduced their risk of suffering several chronic diseases.
The intervention was also very well received by all participants which indicated a high level of feasibility.
Firefighters were thanking me for putting them on a healthier path, telling me how much better they were feeling.
This set the scene for what was to follow in 2018-2019.
I was encouraged to submit an abstract of my dissertation to present at the Nutrition Society winter conference (2017) by my dissertation supervisor and course leader Dr Dee Bhakta.
It got accepted and I was entered into the student competition, competing with twelve BSc / MSc / PhD students from universities across Europe.
As a result, my abstract was published in the journal Proceedings of the Nutrition Society .
I delivered the presentation on the first day of the conference.
The winner was announced the following day at the Royal Society of Medicine.
As the title of my study was announced as the winner, Dr Bhakta and I exchanged a look of jubilant disbelief!
This ranked as my greatest achievement up to that point, up there with my MSc distinction and winning Best Project Prize in dietetics, food and nutrition.
It reinforced self belief and confidence in my ability to deliver an academic presentation at a high level, which was previously one of my greatest fears.
I can honestly say that I used to fear public speaking far more than running into a burning building!
Little did I know that this would soon become an integral part of my future role.
The main part of my role entailed visiting various fire stations and delivering a developed version of my intervention.
This involved group-based nutrition education, assessment of nutritional status, and individual nutrition consultations for firefighters as well as other more sedentary departments within the London Fire Brigade.
This enabled the delivery of a personalised nutrition approach which resulted in significantly improved dietary behaviour, improved body composition (loss of body fat) and improved mood.
Overall, the intervention programme was very well received by staff of all levels in all areas of the workforce.
I also piloted fire station kitchen-based cookery workshops for groups of mess-managers (firefighters who purchase and cook for their watch / team).
This entailed me demonstrating practical methods of putting nutrition theory into practice.
This too was pioneering work and was very well received by mess-managers.
I also held seminars, clinics and develop educational materials for various departments within the Brigade (not just firefighters).
This included nutrition consultation drop-in clinics for women firefighters; interventions to help the more sedentary areas of the workforce, eg the emergency call centre operators and admin teams; seminars and lectures for Fire Safety inspection officers; educational literature creation for the London Fire Brigade Menopause Action Group; nutrition educational content development for the London Fire Brigade Health and wellbeing intranet portal; and regularly answering nutrition questions from LFB staff via email.
I created and delivered a lecture at Brigade HQ on Nutrition and Mental Heath.
Dealing with the situations which firefighters face has a big impact on mental health so I considered this a particularly important piece of work.
The work I did whilst studying at London Met is the foundation of everything I currently do within my professional role.
I now fully appreciate how well the Human Nutrition MSc course has been structured.
I have drawn upon knowledge and skills learned in every single module, from Advanced Metabolic Nutrition to Sports Nutrition to Obesity Policy and Public Health.
The biggest help was obviously the dissertation work which developed a role for myself as a full-time nutritionist for firefighters.
I think it's fair to say that, alongside my PhD which is an extrapolation of my MSc dissertation, I am proud to be one of the leading experts on firefighter nutrition.
Portion sizes!
Firefighters tend to overeat for a variety of reasons.
My intervention programme addresses this issue.
Very much so.
Nutrition is arguably the most confusing area of science.
I've identified a real demand for a reliable source of evidence-based nutrition information that can be trusted.
Firefighters can be considered as 'industrial athletes', and as such they care about their health and physical performance.
I've found that my suggestions are adopted and adhered to in the majority of cases.
My extensive experience as a firefighter is a huge advantage in terms of my ability to communicate and develop rapport with firefighters.
It helps knowing intimately the demands of the job (both physical and mental) and how this interacts with dietary behaviour and nutrition.
Firstly the Human Nutrition (Public Health/Sports) MSc encompassed everything I was interested in.
Location was also a contributory factor, as I could travel to the Holloway campus from home within the hour.
The most impressive facility was the Superlab .
The library was also an excellent place to work.
My favourite piece of equipment was the body composition analyser which London Met loaned to me to carry out dissertation work.
The people â my lecturers and classmates.
Firefighting helped me realise and appreciate that success is a product of persistence, hard work and a strong cohesive positive team.
One person can only achieve so much on their own, and I cannot thank Dr Dee Bhakta enough for her perpetual encouragement and expert supervision, not only throughout my dissertation, but throughout the entire masters degree and onto my PhD.
Dr Bhakta's expert insights, guidance and belief in my ability are integral to my success, and the Human Nutrition students of London Met are extremely fortunate to have such a great course leader.
Professor David McCarthy is also an inspiring, extremely knowledgeable and very helpful lecturer.
They both created a comfortable learning environment.
I was also lucky enough to have some excellent coursemates.
We helped each other through.
What surprised me most of all was how new an area of science nutrition is.
I embarked upon the MSc expecting to find all of the definitive answers hidden within the nutrition world.
What I found is that there is a lot we still don't know.
At first I felt disappointed but that turned onto excitement once I realised we are on the dawn of a new era of many discoveries, and with my research I get to contribute to such discoveries.
I was also able to participate in the 13th European Nutrition Conference which was held in Dublin.
This was a truly enriching experience where I learnt about cutting edge research and emerging findings happening at universities around Europe.
I joined the Nutrition Society immediately following my MSc.
This enabled me to maintain CPD via regular attendance at conferences and webinars whilst providing a valuable network of other nutritionists, dieticians and academics for mutual support.
I would highly recommend this to other nutrition students and graduates.
Enriching.
London Met, in particular the health sciences team are providing support on every conceivable level.
I really couldnât ask for more.
I am thrilled to be undertaking this work and collaborative research with London Met which will directly benefit the health of many people across the UK.
The incredible support of the London Met PHN research group has led us to this point, and none of this would have been possible without the expertise, guidance and unwavering support of Dr Dee Bhakta and Prof David McCarthy.
I recently won the Caroline Walker Trust Nutritionist of the Year award.
I am absolutely thrilled to be on the same list as eminent nutritionists, including Dr Louis Levy, who influences national public health policy; Dr Glenys Jones, Deputy CEO of the Association for Nutrition; Barbara Bray MBE; and Dr Kawther Hashem, who is coordinating the Action on Sugar project.
It is a genuine honour to represent the London Met Public Health Nutrition Research Group, the School of Human Sciences, and the heroic people from the London Fire Brigade who risk their lives to save others.
"I can honestly say that I used to fear public speaking far more than running into a burning building!
Little did I know that this would soon become an integral part of my future role."

Researching wave-based sensor technology to monitor vulnerable people who can get dehydrated frighteningly quickly is the area that PhD researcher Innocent Lubangakene has chosen to focus on.
A self-confessed robotics and artificial intelligence junkie who also studied his undergraduate degree here (see our Computer Systems Engineering and Robotics BEng ), we find out what's driven his interest in this fascinating field where biomedics and engineering meet.
I am originally from Uganda, East Africa, where I initially lived for 18 years.
In 2015, I relocated to the Caribbean, where I spent an additional two years until I was 20.
The chance to further my education and career â particularly in the field of engineering, which I have always been passionate about.
It meant that I had the necessary tools to better myself as an individual academically, whilst also growing as an individual.
The career advice, social and intellectual interactions were all a wonderful cocktail.
Ecstatic would be an understatement.
I have always wanted to create something or a device that would positively impact humanity.
The PhD scholarship is a gateway to this journey and I feel grateful every day as I have a chance to actually do it.
I strongly believe I will.
Firstly, during my undergraduate studies, I worked in the care system and I saw first hand what vulnerable people (particularly those with dementia, learning disabilities, old age) experience as a result of dehydration.
I saw that such people develop acute health problems that can lead to organ failure if not treated.
Secondly, through research, I found that current ways to measure hydration are either chemically based (urine samples) or use impedance meters with electrodes (ie step on a machine and hold with your hands).
These methods are cumbersome, invasive and do not provide real-time information.
Non-invasive methods mean that the device carrying out the medical procedure will not infiltrate human tissue and destroy it.
For example, a needle to draw blood is invasive, while a thermometer to measure temperature is non-invasive.
The electromagnetic wave-based sensor I intend to develop will utilise WIFI signals (2.45GHz) which are permitted by OFCOM to measure reflected signals from the skin.
More signal will be reflected when hydration is poor, and less signal is reflected when hydration is high.
As discussed earlier, this research is primarily engineered to solve the problem of under-hydration and dehydration being experienced around the world.
According to statistics, nearly 3.5 million people die annually from water-related diseases.
Adequately quantifying hydration status in real time could seriously mitigate the death rate and improve on the way vulnerable people are treated and taken care of.
The highlight was achieving a First-class honours degree in my specific field of study.
I also made friends and acquaintances who will last a lifetime.
Lastly, I personally enjoyed the struggle and grit involved in research and experiments.
It's no surprise I opted to continue as a PhD researcher.
For an engineer involved in an experiment, often times you'll fail before you succeed.
This sentiment I have grown to love and cherish.
I enjoy the sports centre â it's a place to regroup and rejuvenate my thought structure.
I also enjoy working away in the microwaves lab as it has all the equipment I need to actualise my research objectives and goals.
My passion is learning and exploring new adventures in robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.
I've always been obsessed with learning as much as I can about anything in this field.
The world is continuously evolving into the digital age.
Having the right skills and knowledge will help you adapt more easily to the changing times.
The chance to always improve is my fundamental driving force.
My business concept (LID xR) was tailored around using virtual reality (VR) technology as a marketing tool for businesses in the hospitality sector â mainly hotels, resorts and beaches.
Yes, I consulted with staff at the Accelerator who were readily available.
I was coached on how to improve on my pitching and also on my business plan which I found very useful in strategising for the Mayorâs Entrepreneurial competition.

I strongly believe actively engaging in physical exercise nurtures oneâs serotonin levels which can improve stress levels.
I also love soul music.
Music is simply beautiful!
I've learnt to be more creative when finding solutions to my problems.
Adaptability is the word I would use.
I hope to continue with my research, publish peer-review papers showing progress in my research.
Lastly, I am optimistic that I'll be able to present my research to create more awareness about my research topic.
Simply go for it.
Not only will you develop academically, but you'll also have opportunities to get involved in alternative intellectual activities such as the Uni's Big idea Challenge as well as student conferences that help build capable individuals who are ready to inspire the next generation.
Adequately quantifying hydration status in real time could seriously mitigate the death rate and improve on the way vulnerable people are treated and taken care of.

This has allowed me to develop new ideas.
I started my research during COVID, so I cannot really compare doing a PhD during COVID and pre COVID.
So I have not been affected that much.
I guess one way I have been affected though is in terms of changing the way in which I'm going to conduct my research.
I cannot go to South Africa â so I have had to be creative with how I am going to collect my primary data.

Iâm grateful for these incredible opportunities because they are preparing me for my career aspirations and building my social network.
My research is exploring social value (SV) delivery through procurement.
Part of its focus is on how SV is embedded within the procurement process/cycle, and by the application of academic theory, it also explores how some competing activities/goals in procurement can be carried out; that is, how procurement can be ambidextrous in delivering SV and the contract it is associated to.
Iâm using multiple case studies for this research and conducting interviews with UK procurement professionals from the public sector; both buyers and suppliers/providers.
Since the suppliers are responsible for delivering what is procured at the right specification, it will be useful to learn from their perspective as well.
The value of this research is that it contributes to a more efficient and sustainable social value delivery through procurement.
Considering the massive benefits (social, economic, and environmental) that can be generated through SV, it would be useful to find ways that facilitate a sustained delivery, by balancing the tensions that may constrain procurement professionals in achieving their objectives.
Also, thereâs a further contribution to the field by studying the suppliersâ perspective which has received limited attention in procurement literature.
I have two very supportive and brilliant supervisors.
To start with, I feel blessed to have Prof.
Nigel Caldwell as my supervisor.
Prof Nigel and I started discussing my PhD research in 2019.
He consistently supported me in developing my proposal â and did that on the basis that the outcome could help me get into any suitable university.
Even when I started the PhD at another university and realised that the environment wasnât supporting my development, Prof Nigel was still there for me â he responded to my emails, held a series of virtual meetings with me and provided support beyond my expectation at no cost.
He is an accomplished professor with a lot on his plate, but he has, throughout the years, created time to support my aspirations and even responds outside of work hours and in holidays.
I must say his likes are rare â and Iâm lucky to be associated with him.
He is my PhD supervisor and my mentor.
Dr Jonida is nothing but amazing, brilliant and supportive.
Her feedback shows me that she reads my work thoroughly with so much attention and she always have useful comments.
Despite her schedule, she swiftly responds to my requests and meeting schedules.
Iâm glad to be working with her on this.
One other wonderful thing about my supervisors is that when theyâve not heard from me for a while, they check in with me.
I know this is a special attribute because Iâve listened to some colleagues who lament about their supervisorsâ response rate (I know people are busy), and for mine to respond swiftly and even check on me, is beyond incredible.

Manchester United Football Club is the focus of an unofficial Twitter account with 70,000+ followers â and growing.
Cameroonian PhD student Wally MBassi Elong is determined to find out what makes this account so popular amongst West Africans and Nigerians â his thesis, Football Fandom, Glocalisation and Man United in Pidgin, tackles the subject head-on.
I was born and grew up in Cameroon.
I graduated from high school in 2008 and enrolled at the Advanced School of Mass Communication (ASMAC) after passing a national competitive entrance examination.
Three years later, I graduated with a degree in advertising.
I took some advanced English classes (IELTS), and then worked in an advertising and PR firm for a year or so before deciding that I wouldnât mind studying a bit more.
I thought about doing a masterâs abroad and with that IELTS of mine, I started applying to UK universities and all my applications were successful.
My parents were thrilled and adhered to my new project (and funded it).
Thatâs how I landed in London in 2014 to study a Media and Communications MA.
The experience was different to what I was used to back home.
When I attended ASMAC, I had classes from 7.30am Monday to Saturday.
I was very surprised to find out that I would only attend classes for a total of nine hours a week on my first semester at London Met; and that I wouldnât be required to write exams and submit assignments nearly every week.
The modules on the course were extremely fascinating.
My favourite modules were: Globalisation and The Media; Digital Cultures; and Digital Media Strategy and Consultancy.
I also did very well in all the modules and got my MA with Distinction.
During the MA, I also met great people who are now my friends.
My favourite project was my MA dissertation.
A few months before receiving my MA, I was thinking that there was no way I could go any further; that after this, I would be over and done with studies.
The truth is, I was exhausted.
I felt overwhelmed with pressure: being a young black male from Cameroon studying in London who has no other choice than to do great (that extra pressure you have on your shoulders when your parents are paying a huge amount of money for you to study abroad and expect excellent results).

I realised that I liked researching and that I was quite good at it.
My lecturers (who are now my PhD supervisors) encouraged me to embark on a research programme.
We are in 2020 now and if everything goes right, I will be defending my PhD thesis in a little less than a year.
I honestly never would have thought I would go that far.
My PhD research is about a social media account called Man United in Pidgin (MUIP).
It provides readers with Manchester United Football Clubâs (MUFC) news and commentaries in Pidgin English (a lingua franca spoken in West Africa).
It started as a Twitter account but now MUIP has invaded Facebook, Instagram, the blogosphere and the mobile apps market.
It has more than 70,000 followers on Twitter.
The research covers four major areas of analysis: sports fandom, social media, globalisation and cultural identity.
It addresses two questions: which discursive resources are used in MUIPâs tweets?
And how do these assist the construction of a West African online identity among its followers?
Through the investigation of the ways in which football discussions and news are conveyed in MUIP, I assess how the glocalisation (blend of global and localisation: adaptation of a global brand to accommodate local users/consumers in local markets) of MUFC meets the needs and expectations of its Nigerian and West African audience on Twitter.
I study how MUIP constitutes an acute tool of active fandom, enabling Nigerians and West Africans to establish a counterpoint to mainstream coverage of Premier League Football.
This research investigates the idea that discursive resources that are used to connect West Africans in leisure activities, such as football and football discussions, penetrate social media via accounts like MUIP and hence unite West Africans from various backgrounds, thereby building a West African online identity.
I have always been quite eccentric in my research interests.
My MA dissertation for example investigated codes and languages used in Ndemdutakesh Facebook pageâs stories and their role in the establishment of a Cameroonian online identity.
As soon as I was over with this fascinating research project, I discovered MUIP and instantly thought that if I ever do a PhD, I would work on that account.
Here we are.
I guess that I can now be called Mr African Lingua Francas-Social Media.
These are the sorts of topics that are interesting to me.
During my interview with the creator of MUIP, we discussed various aspects of his identity.
He also mentioned his name but I offered him anonymity so I will not reveal it.
I will use his initials (IU) instead.
IU is from Anambra State in Nigeria and lives in Lagos.
Talking about his profession, IU stated that he is âinto a lot of thingsâ â he is a banker, a blogger and a vlogger.
He speaks Pidgin English fluently as well but does not classify it as a type of language.
He thought he could create a Pidgin English handle because many people in Africa speak that lingua franca.
The reception was encouraging so he decided to take it seriously.
At the time there was no handle in Pidgin English on the continent.
It was mostly sport news in English â now, many have followed his path in creating digital platforms in Pidgin and accepting Pidgin English (in sports).
He began on Twitter but decided to expand on other platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Blog, mobile app).
More tweets on match days, less tweets on non-match days.
He follows specific guidelines: no insult, little to no retweets.
IU feels happy with what MUIP has achieved and happy to see that other platforms are going into Pidgin English.
IU has produced and released a few music tracks and videos about Manchester United Football Club.
He also created a Man United in Pidgin Fantasy Premier League (MUIPFPL).
The MUIPFPL is in its third year of existence and is open to external sponsors.
IU mentioned having a couple of interactions with some of MUFC players but that it was just on a personal level.
He is not sure if MUFC is aware of his social media handle.
IU thinks that the main followers of his Twitter account mostly come from Nigeria and Ghana.
Some followers are from South Africa and that itâs also spread across a couple of other African countries.
He added that some non-Africans follow it because it is a language they are not used to.
IU claims that MUIPâs tweets allow fans to laugh about the misfortune their favourite club may face.
There is not a huge amount of literature addressing the question of sport fandom in West Africa.
The study of Nigerian and West African football fandom on the internet and social media has until now been glossed over.
My research fits into that gap.
MUIP has created a real sense of identity within a cyber-community.
It has formed an environment similar to a Football Viewing Centre (bars where European leagues football matches are tele-mediated, thereby creating virtual stadiums) â and MUIP provides entertainment and socialising platforms to Nigerian and West African MUFCâs fans and Pidgin English speakers.
I want to be a lecturer and a researcher in media, communications and cultural studies, and so far, London Met has provided me with support and opportunities in order to achieve these goals.
I have been a research assistant a couple of times since I started my research degree and I am also a PASS Facilitator (assisting final year undergraduate students in creative technologies and digital media courses with their final projects and dissertations).
These roles are building my skills as well as my CV.
My favourite spot at the university is the Computing and Digital Media PhD Room (T6-01).
Itâs because itâs my office and I share it with two incredible and lovely individuals.
I go to the gym (a lot) and I play tennis (a lot).
Other than that, I am a bit of a nerd when it comes to my extra-curricular activities.
I visit bookshops, galleries, museums and libraries.
I go to the pub every now and again because I want to watch the Premier League or a European League or the Champions League.
I can sometimes be found singing âredemption songâ at The Rocketâs Karaoke Night.
I am involved in some volunteering as well.
I would say that there has been a substantial improvement compared to when I started.
Thanks to the Pro Vice-Chancellor Research and Knowledge Exchange; the Head of Research Policy and Implementation; the Graduate School; and the Research and Postgraduate Office.
In about a year, theyâve not only equipped research students with skills and knowledge through weekly workshops but theyâve also promoted interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange.
Theyâve also organised a well-attended online research conference (in July 2020).
Through the Postgraduate Research Society, many PhD candidates have also been able to assist and support one another on and off campus.
This is quite valuable as a PhD can be a very lonely adventure.
I would say three things.
Firstly, work on a research project you are passionate about (that goes beyond ordinary interest).
Secondly, work hard (possibly without the play hard bit, or just a little).
Finally, be resilient (itâs going to be hard, very hard at times, but keep going, hard work always pays off).
"Through the Postgraduate Research Society, many PhD candidates have also been able to assist and support one another on and off campus.

After the pandemic, I moved to the UK and completed my master's degree in Renewable Energy from Edinburgh Napier University.
Following that, I received an offer to pursue a PhD and joined London Met.
The main reason I chose to study my PhD at London Met is the project, which aligns perfectly with my expertise.
It is a fully-funded program through a Vice-Chancellor's scholarship that is open to international students.
Additionally, my supervisor, Priyanka , has an impressive research track record, which further solidified my decision to pursue this project.
The DETECT (Disposable sEnsors for meTal detECTion) is an interdisciplinary project initiative focused on developing sustainable, biodegradable electronics for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollutants in water and soil, addressing critical environmental and health challenges.
Global statistics indicate that nearly 30% of the worldâs population lacks access to safely managed drinking water, while approximately 80% of wastewater is released into the environment untreated and approximately 20% of the worldâs freshwater is believed to be at risk due to metal contamination, highlighting the pressing issue of heavy metal contamination.
Once released, these metals are non-biodegradable and accumulate in ecosystems, leading to severe health effects in both humans and animals.
DETECT aims to provide a flexible, low-cost, and portable sensory solution that enables rapid, on-site detection of toxic metals using printed sensors made from eco-friendly materials.
By integrating wireless communication via NFC, the sensors can function as smart tags for digital agriculture and water quality monitoring.
The goal is to offer a user-friendly, low-cost, and portable solution for on-site detection of metal pollutants, particularly across London and Greater London, enabling citizens, farmers and policymakers to assess water and soil quality instantly.
Although I am pursuing my PhD in chemistry, my background is in electrical and electronics engineering.
Working with academics across both schools has allowed me to learn new concepts related to chemistry while polishing my existing knowledge with the engineering team.
I have connected with others who share similar backgrounds, and I can utilise resources and support from both departments, which has been extremely beneficial for my project.
I hope that the impact of my research will be significant in advancing sustainability and addressing critical environmental issues.
By developing innovative solutions, I aim to contribute to cleaner and safer ecosystems.
I aspire to inspire young minds in the field and promote a greater awareness of the importance of sustainable practices in both industry and everyday life.
If I can successfully tackle even a single mind and make a meaningful contribution to sustainability, I would consider my efforts a success.
One of the challenges I face is that, despite having flexible hours, I often become deeply immersed in my research and spend long periods alone, which gradually affects my social life.
And the another is managing stress.
In research, you can face unexpected problems at any moment, and deadlines can feel overwhelming.
I like to think of research as digging for water in a well.
We expect thereâs water at the bottom, but we donât know how deep we need to dig.
Sometimes itâs easy to find, but other times, we have to dig much deeper.
We may encounter obstacles, like rocks, that we need to break through to move forward.
There are moments when, despite our hard work, we may not find what weâre looking for and have to change our approach.
I feel blessed to have experienced researchers as my supervisors.
Their guidance has made this journey much easier so far.
I have found the professors and staff to be incredibly supportive and approachable.
Even though my first supervisor, Dr Priyanka Ganguly, wasnât always physically present, she was always just a phone call away.
My other supervisors, Dr Bhaven Patel and Prof Bal Virdee , are also very supportive and always willing to guide me in any way they can.
The initial days were challenging, but having their support made everything much easier.
My ambitions and family drive me.
My husband is very proud of me and celebrates every achievement as if it were his own.
My mother, who is my first teacher, is the reason behind where I am today.
She dreamed of pursuing higher education but couldnât, so she wants me to fulfil that dream with flying colours.
I am most proud of my journey so far.
As the first graduate in my family, I moved to a new country alone, without any friends or family, breaking the stereotype from my village where girls were often discouraged from going abroad.
I successfully earned my masterâs degree while funding myself through various part-time jobs.
Additionally, I managed to publish my masterâs work in a high-impact journal and secured a fully funded PhD scholarship.
Each of these achievements represents a battle I have won, and they continue to inspire and motivate me.
My favourite place within the University is the main science lab , where I spend most of my time researching.
Itâs a fun environment, as one side focuses on chemistry, while the other explores pharmaceuticals, microbiology and even forensics.
I love being surrounded by many young faces filled with determination and curiosity, which brings me a lot of joy.
I am not currently a member of any formal groups, but in our department, we hold research meetings every Wednesday.
During these meetings, students and lecturers present their work and discuss the challenges and needs of researchers.
Itâs a great opportunity for collaboration and sharing ideas.
Outside of university, I enjoy reading books and watching movies, especially in the sci-fi and fantasy genres.
They allow me to escape reality and encourage me to think outside the box.
Recently, Iâve developed a passion for archery , which the University offers for free every Tuesday and Thursday.
I find it to be a great way to stay focused and relax.
After completing my PhD, I plan to pursue a postdoctoral position in industry and aim to become a full-fledged scientist.
The training I am receiving from my supervisors in various areas, including soft skills and academic knowledge, is incredibly valuable for achieving my goals.
I believe that my experiences at London Met will provide a strong foundation for my future success.
It's important to embrace the journey, which can be a rollercoaster of both highs and lows.
You may face challenges like stress, loneliness and self-doubt, but believing in yourself and pushing through is essential.
Make the most of the University's resources and use your time wisely, as it flies.
Stay organised and maintain a positive mindset, knowing that obstacles and setbacks are part of the process; each failure offers a lesson for a brighter tomorrow.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/profiles/students/roham-sadeghimakki:
Researcher and London Met graduate Roham Sadeghimakki recently contributed his research findings to Public Health England (PHE), which may prove vital in investigating links between obesity and COVID-19.
His extensive PhD work on body composition and respiratory function has put him at the forefront of the research against coronavirus.
He has presented his research at various major conferences, including the UK Congress on Obesity, the European Obesity Summit and the European Congress on Obesity.
He was conferred as a Fellow of the International Society of Hypertension (ISH) in 2018, and has had his peer-reviewed research published in the Annals of Human Biology.
Rohamâs educational journey began in Iran as a medical student before studying an Obesity and Weight Management MSc (now Human Nutrition (Public Health / Sports) MSc) and then completing his PhD in Nutrition and Cardiorespiratory Function at London Met.
Before moving to the UK, I practiced in Iran as a GP for seven years with special interests in cardiology, diabetes, endocrinology and musculoskeletal conditions.
I was aware of the ascent in the prevalence of obesity and lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory problems.
I could see the negative impact that obesity and nutritional imbalance exerted on the underlying conditions and quality of life of many patients.
When I realised that a postgraduate course on obesity and weight management was available at London Met, I decided to study this course to improve my knowledge and skills in the assessment and treatment of patients with excessive weight and malnutrition.
I totally enjoyed working on my MSc dissertation as for the first time, I analysed large-scale health and nutrition data to explore the effect of insulin resistance on the link between obesity and asthma in adults living in the US.
Then, I was given the amazing opportunity of teaching postgraduate public health and nutrition modules as an associate lecturer.
It was so rewarding because I could engage in a teaching role whilst I was conducting research.
It was a fascinating journey as I was learning how to communicate interactively with students and colleagues.
In parallel, my interdisciplinary PhD project on the connections between body composition, respiration and haemodynamic stability unlocked many doors to the wide network of metabolic and nutrition research.
It led to a series of pleasantly unexpected findings that I hope could form a basis for future breakthroughs in sarcopenia and obesity research.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrates the significant role of body composition phenotyping in assessing respiratory function among young to middle-aged adults.
The most interesting finding from my research was the connection between systemic blood pressure, body composition and lung function.
It indicated that excessive fat tissue in trunk and limbs could have a greater impact on limiting respiratory capacity and/or flow rate when accompanied by larger muscle tissue.
For the first time, this study shows that free-living healthy adults who have limited respiratory capacity and/or narrower airways may have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
This association is also observed in the reverse direction.
Adults with increased systolic and diastolic pressure are more likely to have reduced lung capacity and/or increased airway resistance.
Interestingly, this study revealed that metabolic imbalance at whole-body and segmental levels plays a significant role in the crosstalk between respiratory and vascular systems.
In individuals whose overall lean mass was greater than their total fat mass, high diastolic blood pressure impaired the respiratory function to a larger extent than in those with a more balanced whole-body metabolic status or even metabolic overload.
On the contrary, high systolic blood pressure had a deleterious impact on lung function only in individuals with whole-body metabolic overload, ie, those with the predominance of fat over lean mass.
These findings may have important implications for the risk stratification and the management of patients affected by COVID-19 and other respiratory disorders.
Since individuals with obesity and hypertension are generally at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19, the identification of high-risk subgroups of this population based on their body composition phenotype, together with the specific alterations in their systolic and diastolic blood pressure, would enable the clinical team to individualise supportive measures more accurately and allocate life-saving modalities to patients whose combined metabolic and haemodynamic profile gives them a higher risk of COVID-related complications.
Studying at London Met was an exceptional opportunity to develop skills that I would have never achieved.
Over the course of five years, the incredible guidance, support and encouragement that I received from my supervisors, Professor David McCarthy and Dr Dee Bhakta , and my senior colleagues, Afshan Aghili , Dr Abdollah Ghavam i, Dr Simon Dryden and Sarah Illingworth allowed me to discover new areas of research and work.

Now, thanks to this fruitful journey, I am a physician, obesity specialist, nutritionist, data analyst and lecturer.
I used the Superlab several times for dietary assessment â to compare the energy and macronutrient intake estimated by a food diary against the criterion method of bomb calorimetry.
Also, I analysed a 24-hour urinary sodium excretion there as part of my study on the association between salt intake and systemic blood pressure in postgraduate students.
The distinguishing feature of London Metâs Superlab is the wide range of the state-of-the-art equipment which makes it possible to carry out a large variety of multidisciplinary research and educational projects concomitantly; it accommodates the academic and productive purposes of scientists and other stakeholders from all areas of life sciences.

Founder and CEO of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse (SEA), Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs is a graduate of London Metâs Woman and Child Abuse MA .
SEA was set up in 2017 in response to Dr Sharp-Jeffsâ determination to raise awareness of economic abuse in the UK.
The charity, which is the only one in the UK to raise awareness of economic abuse and transform responses to it, has gone from strength to strength, and SEAâs work has been highlighted on BBC Breakfast, the New York Times and The Guardian, to name a few.
Nicola was awarded an OBE in 2020 for her services to victims of domestic and economic abuse.
She also won the 2021 Charity Times Rising Leader of the Year Award.
Undertaking the Woman and Child Abuse MA was a pivotal point both professionally and personally, introducing me to feminism and the womenâs sector.
I use the concepts taught on the course daily and continue to interact with my fellow students through work.
My dissertation on economic abuse was the beginning of the journey that led to SEA being established alongside the support of Professor Liz Kelly throughout.
The most valuable element of the course was being able to apply the concepts taught to practice.
It also linked me into a valuable network â again both in academic and practice terms.
I look back and feel hugely grateful to have had the opportunity to do the course and be taught by leaders in the field.
Many women experience economic abuse within the context of intimate partner violence.
It is vital that we better understand and address this form of abuse because economic stability is linked to physical safety.
Women who experience economic abuse are five times more likely to experience physical abuse than those who donât.
Moreover, when women experience economic abuse in the context of coercive control, they are at increased risk of homicide and taking their own life.
Abusers exploit womenâs existing economic inequality or create economic instability to reduce their partnerâs ability to resist control.
Women who canât find Â£100 at short notice are 3.5 times more likely to experience economic abuse.
Without access to the economic resources required to leave and live independently, victims stay with abusers for longer and experience more harm as a result.
The Domestic Abuse Bill provides a definition of economic abuse:
âAny behaviour* that has a substantial and adverse effect on [a victimâs] ability to â a) acquire, use or maintain money or other property**, or b) obtain goods or services"
*âBehaviourâ includes control through restriction, exploitation and/or sabotage.
**âPropertyâ would cover items such as a mobile phone or car and âgoods and servicesâ would cover, for example, utilities such as heating, or items such as food or clothing
The work of SEA is informed by Experts by Experience â a group of women who speak openly and honestly about what they have gone through so that they can be a force for change.
They inform everything we do.
Our specialist team is made up of experts who can provide support to frontline professionals in relation to complex economic abuse cases linked to banking/financial services, debt, benefits and housing.
We also offer accredited and tailored training for those working across a wide range of sectors/industries, as well as written resources to support practice.
Our policy and research team ensures that victim-survivorsâ voices and experiences are captured and shared with policy and decision makers in industry and government to influence change.

Our impact and partnerships team evaluates what interventions are effective to address economic abuse and who we need to work with to make change happen.
I had been researching economic abuse for nearly a decade â starting with my MA dissertation at London Met â and waiting for an organisation to take up the issue and run with it.
Having spoken to hundreds of domestic abuse victim-survivors, I knew that economic abuse was a barrier to leaving, the reason why so many struggled to rebuild their lives independently and why some went back.
I was particularly struck by how economic abuse stopped women from achieving their full potential.
I knew there was good practice internationally and had heard about the Fellowship from two fellow doctorate students.
My travels to the USA (July 2016) and Australia (November 2016) made me realise that I needed to be the change I wanted to see.
The learning from my Fellowship created the foundations on which to build Surviving Economic Abuse (SEA).
The recommendations I made within my Fellowship report enabled me to be strategic from the beginning.
I knew from my time in Australia that economic abuse needed to be recognised within national policy/legislation on violence against women to create a framework through which to develop responses.
Timing is everything and, by amazing luck, the Queen brought forward new legislation in June 2017 â the Domestic Abuse Act.
I made a case to the Westminster Government that economic abuse should be recognised within the statutory definition of domestic abuse which the Bill introduced.
This was successful.
In addition, I worked with the Westminster Government to develop a definition of economic abuse within the Bill.
The Westminster Government went on to fund work on economic abuse which SEA delivered in partnership with specialists in money/debt advice, housing and policing.
This funding also enabled SEA to work directly with banks and building societies and support them in implementing the UK Finance Code of Practice on Financial Abuse which SEA advised on the development of.
In addition, I drew on learning from the US within a funding application to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) seeking to replicate work around dealing with coerced debt â the Economic Justice Project .
This was the charityâs founding project and ran for three years.
One of the recommendations of the project â to develop and pilot an Economic Abuse Evidence Form for advocacy with creditors was recommended to the Money and Pensions Service as part of the UK Financial Wellbeing Strategy.
This led them to provide grant funding for a pilot which kicked off in January 2020.
SEA also continued to work on the Domestic Abuse Bill, calling for an amendment to broaden the scope of the Controlling or Coercive Behaviour Offence within the Serious Crime Act (2015) so that it recognised post-separation (including economic) abuse.
The Westminster Government supported this amendment in March 2021.
One highlight of setting up the charity has been the traction that the issue of economic abuse has gained â both in practice and policy.
There was very little support available in 2017 and now there is good practice and resources exist to direct victim-survivors to.
I am particularly proud of working with Lloyds Banking Group to set up a specialist Domestic and Financial Abuse Team to respond to victim-survivors.
Recognition of economic abuse by the Westminster Government has created a framework within which change can happen.
Another highlight has been working alongside the Experts by Experience group to bring about this change.
Challenges are linked to practical issues such as building a charity infrastructure as SEA has grown from me working part-time in 2017 to a team of 25 in 2021.
Being an Emeritus Research Fellow means that I can continue to undertake academic research into economic abuse, and I have published two journal articles in this capacity.
I also contribute to teaching on the Woman and Child Abuse MA and the intellectual culture of the Unit.

One of the coldest cities on earth, best known for revealing the ice-age secrets of long-gone woolly mammoths, Yakutsk in deepest Siberia is home to one of our architecture PhD candidates, Maiia Sivtseva .
We talk to Maiia to find out more about her life and her studies in this frozen world.
As you mentioned, Yakutsk is the best known for its extreme climatic conditions and continuous permafrost landscape.
It is also a capital of a quite diverse republic of Sakha, where indigenous Siberian cultures meet Russian culture.
If you look at the urban character of the city, it's a mix of old Soviet architecture and new modern buildings that reflect on traditional Sakha architecture and its beliefs of animism and shamanism.
The built environment in Yakutia has many regulations due to the contextual affordances.
For example, all the large-scale buildings must be designed 1.5m above the ground level to prevent melting of permafrost â and the material structure of buildings should be thick enough to survive the winter season, when temperatures drop below -50C.
Yes, thatâs right.
Architecture as a discipline is very much linked to its context: not only physical characteristics, but also the political and cultural history and realm.
Being raised in a traditional Sakha family, I was always interested to learn more about my native culture.
Although the Soviet regime took a toll on indigenous cultures as it was supressing any kind of identity and otherness, Sakha traditions and language managed to survive.
However, culture is fluid and constantly transforms with time.
Especially nowadays â with globalisation and technologies, everything changes rapidly.
It's fascinating to investigate how traditional cultures/architecture naturally evolve and adapt to the modern world.
Yes, my research is on participatory placemaking possibilities in Yakutsk, how it can work as a democratic tool for shared-space development by its users.
I'm particularly interested in the combination of a bottom-up and top-down approach, where grassroot movements and initiatives get support from the top.
I believe this could make tangible change in the way shared spaces are built (with local materials) and function (ie specific architecture that meets the needs of the users).
Climate change effects are certainly worsening in Siberia: there's melting of the permafrost, flooding and wildfires.
Especially wildfires.
Last summer, more than 8.5 million hectares of forests burned down in Yakutia, including wildlife and villages.
Heavy smoke and fog, and the pollution formed by wildfires poisoned the air in settlements for many months.
Unfortunately, only the symptoms of climate change are being tackled â not the causes.
Hopefully, small changes such as authorised waste recycling, the use of local resources in food supplies and in construction will lead to bigger changes.
I hope that my research findings from the PhD will contribute to a knowledge of architectural participatory placemaking in Yakutsk, and more broadly, to arctic and subarctic regions.
I aim to examine to what extent participatory design and collaborative making can unravel specific place-based affordances and ways of approaching existing issues, using and expanding the potential of the local materials.
This could lead to more sustainable, inclusive and meaningful shared-space design that improves the quality of life of the users.
The primary reason was my supervisors Maurice Mitchell and Bo Tang ( Architecture of Rapid Change and Scarce Resources (ARCSR) research group at London Met's School of Art, Architecture and Design), their philosophical framework and practical approach to design.
Secondly, the support of the whole research school and my peers with their fascinating projects, from and with whom I can constantly learn.
Architectural schools in the UK and Siberian Russia are drastically different in their approaches.
In my opinion, Siberian Russian school is more about normatives and regulations, technologies and details, academic drawing and structural mechanics.
Itâs more about theory and following the rules, Iâd say.
The UK schools are more about teaching us to think, being imaginative and including the human aspect of architecture more.
However, it doesnât exclude the technical part either.
At ARCSR, we use a learning-by-making methodology that gives an even deeper understanding of materiality and construction.
Studying remotely was challenging.
The pandemic has cancelled a couple of my life projects back in Yakutsk and changed my research methods.
That was topped with my personal circumstances.
But my supervisors and some counselling sessions helped me throughout the very worst bits.
We have weekly research seminars at the School of Art, Architecture and Design, where we can listen to work from our peers and discuss our difficulties and our findings.
You not only get inspired, but also receive insightful advice from the other researchers.
I hope to stay both in academia and practice after completing my PhD.
It would be great to implement my imaginative research work into live projects.
This year I have started co-teaching a module at Oxford Brookes University which is very exciting.
It would be ideal to continue to expand the principles of our ARCSR work in the other parts of the UK and the world.
Humanitarian architecture can be very imaginative and sensitive to the needs of a place.
I would advise anyone to participate in as many activities as you can.
This could be online seminars, presentations or discussions.
Meeting and talking to experts in your field is the key too.

The impact will drive practical applications of machine learning, foster societal benefits for enhanced computer vision capabilities and advance scientific knowledge.
It can be quite challenging to navigate and assimilate a vast amount of knowledge and theories within a tight timeframe, as well as to manage failed experiments and unexpected results during studies.
I view my current achievements not as a ceiling but as stepping stones to further potential.
Each goal I accomplish serves as proof that I can do more, inspiring me to set and pursue even higher aspirations.
One of my proudest moments is fostering students' academic self-confidence.
While teaching in Hong Kong, I witnessed numerous students who initially struggled with their studies realise their potential to grasp engineering concepts, eventually developing a passion for learning and pursuing advanced studies after graduation.
As part of my PhD, I teach and facilitate workshops in Data Analysis and Visualisation, Data Warehousing and Big Data, Data Mining and Machine Learning, and Programming for Data Analytics.
This deepens my understanding of subject matters for my research project, enhances my communication skills, and motivates me to pursue excellence in my studies.
My favourite place is the courtyard where I relish the fresh air and find stress relief.
On sunny days, I love taking brief breaks under the trees, enjoying a drink and temporarily setting aside thoughts of delta x and delta y.
The courtyard is also perfect for socialising with classmates from various backgrounds.
Aside from my studies, I enjoy exploring.
London is a diverse city where various cultures converge, creating a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere.

Counselling psychology Prof Doc student Kasturi Torchia has developed an unusual sports specialism to support her work into psychosomatic and somatopsychic trauma related psychology: lâart du dÃ©placement or, as itâs more commonly known, Parkour.
Psychology is in everything.
I canât find anything in life that doesnât require some kind of understanding of another, whether thatâs an object or a person â itâs everywhere.
I think itâs really important to have an understanding of what brings us together and what separates us, and how we navigate through that â for me, thatâs psychology.
Counselling psychology is something that stems from a value system that I am in line with.
It has a philosophy underpinning it that is extremely humanistic; itâs person-centred.
For me, counselling psychology means moving slightly away from the medical model and staying true to our uniqueness as individuals.
Doing my masterâs and PhD here made me connect with the community a lot more than I would have at a different university.
The outreach work I did in my masterâs was really helpful and I try to integrate that with the work I do now.
The creative projects that I work on are only possible because of the systematic understanding I was given from my courses.
My daily life includes management, counselling psychology in terms of practice, therapy delivery and a lot of outreach awareness-raising roles.
More recently I was appointed the mental health lead and duty of care lead for Parkour nationally.
I am in charge of a lot of the safeguarding policies and the delivery of good and ethical practice around the UK for Parkour free running.
Itâs innovative, creative and I get to work with people from so many disciplines â itâs invigorating and the fact that my tutor supported my research has allowed me to do this.
Itâs exciting day to day, itâs overwhelming...
but also really cool.
London Met provides a diversity that is quite unique.
Thereâs a nice eclectic community â there are people from all walks of life.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/profiles/students/hoyee-tse-interview:
How visual culture connects with community has long held a fascination for PhD researcher Hoyee Tse , whose work has led her to explore areas such as how society can help museums and art collections to digitise their materials as well as understanding why curation in these sectors hasn't always had the most diverse of workforces.
I trained as a social art historian.
I've always been interested in the meaning-making of art and cultural objects and the politics of cultural representation in relation to various social ideologies.
Previously, I worked in a range of professional roles at various private and public arts and cultural institutions.
These experiences are certainly crucial for refining fundamental skills such as communication and public-facing skills when I am developing my research and interacting with other members of London Met.
As I also had some experiences working in different academic settings, being able to engage myself into the projects developed by scholars from other disciplines like earth science, anthropology and cultural heritage built another set of practical skills when I came to realise an impactful research project lasting for several years.
So, I would like to bring these skills, knowledge and experiences to London Met by developing a solid, well-grounded academic project that can engage with the wider society about the meaningful layers and dimensions of their society today.
The most challenging part of working in the arts and cultural and museum industries is about the barriers that are rooted at its historical/traditional structure.
It is more of a conceptual structure rather than an organisational structure for people from the global majority.
Therefore, it does take a considerable effort just to simply enter the industry.
However, as someone who has a strong interest in history and visual culture, it is indeed the most satisfying area that I have ever worked in.
To curate and support the development of a collection did offer me the pleasure of being able to observe and analyse the works of art as much as to help the public to learn about the uniqueness of every single piece of those.
My Design Trust fellowship at the Royal College of Art, London was about the potential use of digital platforms as a community-engaged space for co-curating and collecting contemporary design objects in London and Hong Kong.
My approach was inspired by the âGuarani and KaiowÃ¡ Virtual Museum: Experimental Approaches to Collaborative Heritageâ project of the UCL Multimedia Anthropology Lab.
I considered the convenience and availability of digital devices to digitise, which is always a lengthy process in cultural institutions, and whether it's possible for digitisation to be conducted by local communities.
I decided to try to develop a community-engaged digitalisation model with photogrammetry technology during this fellowship.
For my CIRCE fellowship, my focus shifted from the objects to the people of arts and cultural institutions.
With my firsthand experiences in the sector and my curatorial experience with Undone Theatre on the Butter Project, I spent my fellowship period looking into the employment of East Asian curatorial and museum professionals in the UK.
This project was to take the community as a case study to reveal the persistent barriers of the sector.
I interviewed many East Asian professionals from the sector and identified what made the sector fail in really diversifying its workforce.
Time.
There are too many sources and literature that I can and need to go through before deciding what is suitable and what is not suitable for my research.
So, there's never enough time.
Believing that my research can contribute to society.
Whether it is only about a certain social group or a specific phenomenon, I believe my research can document and form a perspective on something that might be overlooked by society.
I still keep going on my way through studying and learning.
It is not an effortless way, especially because of how fast our world works today.
The process of acquiring in-depth knowledge on subjects like visual culture (as a human being but not an AI machine) is going against the tide.
I do not have a solid plan now but it's highly likely that I will continue to develop research projects related to the connection between visual culture and the power dynamic of our society.
I think what London Met will help me with is to provide me with the freedom to develop ideas, regardless of how controversial or alternative those ideas can be.
"Whether it is only about a certain social group or a specific phenomenon, I believe my research can document and form a perspective on something that might be overlooked by society."

Research project featuring photographs taken by students reveals housing inequality and impacts on education
Date: 16 January 2024
In November last year, London Met hosted a 4 day exhibition in the Great Hall as part of the âNo Fixed Abodeâ research project, featuring photographs taken by students highlighting the pressing issue of housing inequality and how this impacts their education at London Met.
The exhibition, developed from a series of Photovoice workshops served as a platform for student voices, offering a unique perspective on this critical social issue.
Led by Donna Jones, Head of Subject, Challenge Champion for Discrimination together with Glyn Robbins Senior Lecturer and research assistant and Placements and Partnerships Officer Anna Jakobczak, the research enabled deeper understandings of the needs and challenges faced by students experiencing homelessness and housing instability during times of housing crisis and rising living costs, and how it affects their studies.
By actively involving students as co-researchers, the initiative not only sheds light on these challenges but also works collaboratively to develop meaningful solutions.
One of the co-researchers, Muhammad Saeed Ul Hassan Raza, MSc International Business Management with Project Management, commented: "It has been an empowering experience to use visual storytelling to document real-life struggles and amplify the voices of those often unheard.
By participating, I felt a sense of responsibility to bring attention to the emotional and academic toll inadequate housing can have on students.
He added: âThis project has also helped me develop a deeper understanding of the systemic issues affecting student housing, beyond my own experiences.
It's more than just a research initiative â it's a call to action for institutions and policymakers to prioritise student welfare."
The opening event was well attended, and guests were keen to discuss and share ideas on improving support services at the university.
Key messages from the Photovoice workshops included a need for more visible housing and accommodation support and advice from the university with active engagement with students, a dedicated housing support team, and developing partnerships with local landlords and housing providers to negotiate more affordable housing options.
The research included an anonymous survey that attracted over 80 respondents.
Glyn Robbins, who led this part of the research, said:
âThis project started just before Christmas last year, when one of my students and her four children were victims of a so-called âno-fault evictionâ.
Their lives were turned upside down and the student was unable to complete her degree.
The research shows that many other London Met students face similar problems.
We need to do more to help them and demand change.â
Donna Jones, the Head of Subject who led the PhotoVoice and Podcast elements, explained:
âPrecarious housing impacts so many of our students and their experience studying with us.
We need to consider actions to begin to address what the co-researchers have clearly articulated would help them continue successfully with their studies.â
Another co-researcher, Hemlata Thapa, BSc Dietetics and Nutrition, commented: âBeing part of this research, I found new insights about the difficulties students go through and how they improvise with their circumstances to get the best they can do and it inspired me a lot.
This project has been able to bring the problems out, the students are facing.
It would be a great relief to see if not all, some of the issues are resolved so that students can focus on study more efficiently.â

Date: 09 December 2024
London Met honoured its affiliation with Arsenal Football Club at the Emirates Stadium, where Arsenal marked International Day of Persons with Disabilities with a special event focused on accessibility and inclusion in the workplace alongside Google Pixel and Microlink .
Emirates Stadium played host to local partners, businesses, and disabled communities who came together to share experiences and knowledge, and learn about some of the solutions and actions that can be taken to improve outcomes in work for disabled people.
It comes a year on from research published by London Met and Islington Council that showed over half of disabled people in the borough are out of work, a problem facing the UK.
Challenges remain in Islington and the UK more broadly.
Dr Jane Lewis , who led London Metâs research into this area, delved deeper into the root causes of such high unemployment amongst disabled communities.
Case study samples from the disability employment report launched last year were featured in the discussion.
She commented: âDisabled people experience numerous barriers and discrimination both getting a job and while in employment, including stigma and accessibility challenges.
This can also result in pay gaps with their non-disabled colleagues.â
More esteemed colleagues from London Met including Lina Nyby, Qicheng Yu and Sandra Fernando and her brilliant London Met student presented impactful findings, including an impressive disability employment index relating to the research on a vibrant stand, designed to showcase some of the technologies developed to support accessibility for the disabled community.
The evening featured special contributions from partners and experts across the space, as well as Arsenal Managing Director, Richard Garlick.
Author, mouth artist and Arsenal supporter, Henry Fraser, also spoke on the âtransformative power of acceptanceâ in conversation with award-winning filmmaker and former London 2012 Marketing Chief, Greg Nugent.
Arsenal was the first professional football club to achieve Disability Confident Leader status in 2018 and retained this status earlier this year, part of an ongoing commitment to being a diverse and inclusive club for its people.
Hannah Mansour, Director of ESG at Arsenal, said : âInclusion is a force for progress.â
âWhen we surround ourselves with new and different perspectives, we make better decisions, which drives us forward.
At the core of that is a sense of belonging â where we feel we can contribute to growth and progress.
âThatâs what weâre striving towards at Arsenal, and we were delighted to share this perspective with our partners and local community at our home in north London, with the goal of supporting better employment outcomes for disabled people.
Itâs important to lift each other on this journey â sharing experiences, solutions, and areas for improvement â so that we can build a more connected and inclusive community where everyone feels they belong.â
Christopher Patnoe, Head of Accessibility and Disability Inclusion for EMEA at Google, joined on behalf of one of Arsenalâs partners, Google Pixel.
He spoke on the importance of âfailing forwardâ in making progress.
He explained: âIf you design for the edges, you get the centre for free...if you make accessibility and inclusion scary, people arenât going to want to do it â but if you make it joyous, fun and innovative, then you are going to attract the best talent.
Your product gets better, your culture gets better, and your business gets better.â
London Met is proud to support partners and Islington neighbours like Arsenal with research innovation that has real impact on peoplesâ lives, in and beyond the workforce.

Local residents took part in a research day to influence ârewildingâ in Londonâs gardens
Date: 12 November 2024
On 16 July, the Wild Ways research day was hosted at London Metropolitan University's Holloway campus for local residents to learn about rewilding in London and the Wild Ways project.
The residents participated in workshops to help create strategies that will encourage Londoners to rewild their gardens.
London Met researchers led the workshops and documented residentsâ suggestions for influencing the work of London changemakers.
Wild Ways is a London Metropolitan University research project, in partnership with Kusuma Trust and the award-winning Rewild My Street campaign, which combines design and behaviour change to explore urban rewilding.
Rewilding entails incorporating wildlife-friendly characteristics into outdoor settings (for example, providing food, water and housing for wild animals, as well as adopting nature-friendly gardening practices).
Wild Ways is based at the Centre of Urban for Built Ecologies and part of the Universityâs civic and community initiative, London Met Lab: Empowering London, which aims to address the capital's urgent challenges.
The Wild Ways research team consists of London Met academics SiÃ¢n Moxon and Justin Webb, with student research assistants from London Met and Dr Mina Samangooei of Oxford Brookes University.
The event was supported by the Labâs Centre for Applied Research on Empowering Society.
âThe research team thoroughly enjoyed the day and had overwhelmingly positive feedback from the residents who participated.
Everyone was enthusiastic about the Wild Ways project and optimistic about changing rewilding behaviour in Londonâs gardens, and many of the participants had impressive knowledge about current practice and policies in the field.
We gathered lots of invaluable data from the workshops and focus groups, and are now looking forward to continuing to work with some of the attendees to analyse this and use it to create a strategy to drive change in London through a dedicated steering group," said SiÃ¢n Moxon, co-researcher of the Wild Ways study.
Through collaborative workshops and focus groups, residents helped to co-create a word cloud to define what urban rewilding means for London's private gardens and also brainstormed intervention strategies.
In turn, this will help Londonâs policymakers, designers, and conservation organisations promote rewilding to more residents.
As appreciation for their contribution, each attendee received a Â£20 shopping voucher, a 'Wild Makeover Guide' booklet, sustainable stationary, as well as sustainable vegetarian lunch and refreshment options for participating in the research day.

The Universityâs London Met Labs team partnered with local advocacy groups and stakeholders to present two events aimed at uplifting and supporting local communities.
Date: 22 March 2024
Earlier in March, the London Met Lab: Empowering London team led two events with London based charities and volunteer organisations.
The first event was conference held in partnership with Skye Alexandra House , a London-wide group that provides trauma informed care services to vulnerable girls and young women.
A second event was organised with Voluntary Action Islington , an organisation that provides information, training and support to volunteers, staff and trustees within the voluntary and community sector in Islington.
Organiser of the events and Director of London Engagement, Sophie Cloutterbuck said, âthe London Met Lab is proud to have played a role in these two successful events.

This inspiring event aligned with the International Women's Day theme âCount Her In: Accelerating Gender Equality Through Economic Empowermentâ.
HER VOICE shone a light on the challenges faced by women and girls who have experienced sexual violence.
The conference explored strategies to support survivors on their path to healing, aiming to empower participants to regain confidence and pursue their aspirations.
Through powerful speakers, engaging workshops, and thought-provoking discussions, HER VOICE served as a platform for celebrating women's strength and fostering connections within the community.
Building on this momentum, the London Met Lab partnered with Voluntary Action Islington for Islington's Voluntary, Community, Faith and Social Enterprise Conference on March 12.
Over 120 partners came together to discuss the critical issues facing Islington's communities.
This collaborative space allowed participants to explore how the Voluntary, Community, Faith and Social Enterprise (VCFSE) sector, Islington Council, and London Met can work together more effectively to address these challenges.
Discussions focused on building capacity, increasing investment in the VCFSE sector, and strengthening existing partnerships to ensure the most marginalized and underserved communities receive the support they deserve.

London Metropolitan University's Centre for Creative Arts, Cultures and Engagement ( CREATURE ) is partnering with the Liliesleaf Trust UK (TLTU) on a Â£1.2 million project to create the first centre dedicated to the history and legacy of the UKâs anti-apartheid movement.
Supported by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the Anti-Apartheid Legacy: Centre of Memory and Learning will be based at the former headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC) on Penton Street, Islington, not far from London Metâs Holloway Campus.
Over the next few years, CREATURE will collaborate on a rolling programme of heritage programmes focused on artist and creative responses, led by CREATURE and TLTU shared Curatorial Research Fellow (CRF) who will work closely with Professor Wessie Ling , Director of CREATURE and Caroline Kamana , Director at TLTU.
The funding for the CRF will be drawn from The Liliesleaf Trust UKâs award with matched funding from London Met.
The programme will explore links between the anti-apartheid movement's heritage and pressing contemporary issues such as migration, inequality, structural racism, cultural marginalisation and will be connected to disenfranchised audiences through targeted engagement programmes.
"This project represents a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between past struggles and present challenges,â commented Professor Ling.
âBy engaging with disenfranchised audiences and exploring contemporary issues through the lens of the anti-apartheid movement, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of social justice and its ongoing relevance."
Known for its interdisciplinary research and contributions across various creative disciplines, CREATURE is well-positioned for this venture.
As a hub for cultural and creative industries, material and visual culture, and practice-based research, involvement ensures a multifaceted approach to the project.
"We are excited to see the contribution that the CRF will make to the overall TLTU London Met partnership," said Caroline Kamana.
"Through this role, we hope to strengthen the public engagement and research impact for both TLTU and CREATURE."
This partnership highlights CREATURE's dual role as academic researchers and cultural practitioners, with a strong tradition in artivism and curation.
The initiative promises to be a significant contribution to both heritage preservation and contemporary cultural discourse.
This project continues Professor Lingâs longstanding collaboration with TLTU, which last year saw her work with the Liliesleaf Trust UK to commission new art work by Black, Global Majority and intersectional artists .
It also extends from a pilot archival project on Anti-Apartheid Legacy: Material Culture, Heritage and Now in which they worked with communities to explore and respond to lived experience of race-based injustice, and imagine new futures.
Between 1978-1994, 28 Penton Street (pictured as artists' impression) was a central hub for international opposition to South African apartheid and a nerve centre of anti-apartheid planning and activity.
The London HQ of the African National Congress, it acted as a base for many critical activities that underpinned the struggle and the transition to a new democratic South Africa.

Date: 16 November 2023
London Met and Islington council have conducted research to identify unemployment rates among residents with varied disabilities and long-term health conditions, such as deafness and visual impairment.â¯â¯
The key identified barriers include unfair treatment, discrimination, lack of awareness, training, and support from employers, as well as stigma and ignorance about mental health conditions, learning disabilities, neuro-diverse people, deafness, and visual impairment.
This research is part of the London Met Lab: Empowering London initiative, which seeks to engage the University with community partners.â¯
The study analysed economic inactivity and employment levels among people with disabilities, and whether those with specific disabilities and long-term health conditions tend to suffer more.â¯ Additionally, focus groups with these individuals were used to investigate employment barriers.â¯â¯
âThe Islington disability project has exposed the extent to which people with disabilities suffer discrimination, both in accessing work and whilst in the workplace.
These residents with varying health and learning challenges have voiced the need to increase disability awareness with employers and employment advisors alike, if their skills and potential are to be realised,â commented Dr Jane Lewis, lead researcher on this project and senior lecturer of sociology at London Met.
âThe project, commissioned in partnership with the London Borough of Islington, highlights the importance of working with local partners in the community to make changes.
The report reflects the strategic focus of the University on issues of social equity and justice.â
People with disabilities and long-term health conditions have significantly higher unemployment rates than those without.
The lack of opportunities in work environments for people who are deaf and manage learning disabilities is a significant barrier.
Recruitment processes, particularly online applications, can be a major barrier for people with lower levels of digital literacy or those without access to a laptop and broadband.â¯â¯
Those living with disabilities, sensory impairments, and long-term health conditions are pushed into poverty by a sustained pattern of low-skilled and low-paying employment, which often results in lack of confidence and low expectations.â¯â¯
Beyond this, low levels of educational qualifications, negative experiences of mainstream education, and literacy in English as opposed to British Sign Language (BSL), have also been highlighted as barriers to accessing employment and recruitment processes.â¯â¯
Santiago Bell-Bradford, Executive Member of Inclusive Economy and Jobs at Islington Council added: âAs a Council, we want Islington to be a place where people can live sustainable, happy and healthy lives.
Improving our disabled residentsâ chances of finding good work is part of that ambition.
We are delighted to have worked with colleagues at London Metropolitan University on the research project.
We know that the recommendations will help usâ¯ reach more peopleâ¯ and contribute to our ambition of creating a more equal futureâ¯ in â¯our borough.ââ¯â¯
The research underlines the need for disability awareness in workplaces, particularly for people with mental health conditions.
Research participants who are deaf have experienced discrimination and raised issues about the need for deaf awareness, such as fire alarms and challenging stereotyping.â¯â¯
Findings reveal the lack of clarity over when and where to disclose information about health conditions is a major concern.
General lack ofâ¯awareness and lack of support, including BSL support, throughout services such as the DWP Job Centres, are also discussed.â¯â¯
In addition, the study addresses the duration and cost of diagnosis for neuro-diverse conditions, as well as the need for regular affordable access to gyms and swimming facilities for rehabilitation.â¯â¯
To tackle the challenges raised, a thorough set of recommendations on how the Council can adopt integrated, long-term, and well-funded approaches to address these employment barriers is included in the report.
This involves integrating wider employment, income support, health, and other needs of individuals with disabilities by expanding outreach teams, practice in employment support, and wider service delivery.
It is also essential to tackle discrimination and concentrate on abilities instead, dispelling the notion that individuals with disabilities can only obtain low-skilled, entry-level positions.

Earlier this month, London Met students and staff members travelled to Cape Town to help preparations for an exhibition held to celebrate Leah Tutuâs 90 th birthday on 14 October.
This visit is the first of two trips with the support of the Vice-Chancellor that gives students an opportunity to work abroad.
Speaking about the visit, Professor Lynn Dobbs said: âInternational work and study opportunities like these allow students to expand their horizons.
London Met is shaping global citizens who are equipped to drive innovation and foster understanding in an increasingly interconnected world.â
Leah Tutu is a renowned activist and the founder of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation (DLTLF).
She has devoted her life to the pursuit of justice and freedom and shared her unwavering passion for ending apartheid with her husband, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, together, they challenged the oppressive regime.
Leah Tutu drove the Domestic Workers and Employers Project at the South African Institute of Race Relations from 1976 to 1984.
Her tireless advocacy for the economic and human rights of domestic workers during the apart
The universityâs involvement in the exhibition arose through London Metâs ongoing partnership with The Liliesleaf Trust UK's Anti-Apartheid Legacy: Centre of Memory & Learning (TLTU), a charity working to advance public knowledge of the international movement against apartheid and the contemporary relevance of learning from this heritage, particularly within anti-racist and social justice focused missions.
Sophie Cloutterbuck, one of the instrumental organisers of this partnership, said âA key element of our partnership with the Liliesleaf Trust UK is the collaborative art and curatorial community engagement that we can work together to accomplish.
The exhibition for the indomitable Leah Tutu was a unique and wonderful opportunity for our students and staff to engage with an internationally and historically significant institution.â
Caroline Kamana, Director of TLTU, said âWe are delighted that our partnership with London Metropolitan University was showcased through our South African based partners, The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.
Itâs fitting that students representing both Graphic Design and Illustration & Animation represented our partnership at the exhibition opening in Cape Town.
Over the last three years of our partnership with London Met, the exceptional creativity and depth of insightful reflections the students from these two disciplines have shown in response to anti-Apartheid heritage has supported us to engage wider audiences with its contemporary resonances and themes of resilience, collaboration, and inclusion.
Weâre honoured to have been part of the 90th birthday celebrations for Mrs Tutuâ
Selected pieces from the âStrength in Unityâ travelling exhibition created by London Met students for TLTU are on display, alongside two additional artworks of Leah Tutu and Mary Benson that were commissioned by The Liliesleaf Trust UK.
Students Alicia Jara Alfonso Molina and Lucia Caceres Alves were chosen to attend the exhibition in Cape Town.
Alicia was thrilled at this opportunity, âDuring the exhibition, I learnt more about the people whose acts changed the direction of a country battling injustice and inequality, as well as celebrating Leah Tutu's 90th birthday at the Desmond & Leah Tutu Foundation, which was a once in a lifetime chance.
âIt was such an enriching experience from beginning to end.
It is one thing to study and read about something, but it is another to experience it because when you are there, you can feel and see the consequences and effects of the apartheid government even thirty years after it ended, as well as the struggle and the fight of the people to recover and grow together.â
Course Leader for BA Illustration & Animation, Emily Evans, ran this project alongside Associate Lecturer Olu Oke.
Emily also attended the trip to Cape Town alongside the students.
âThe illustrative posters by my students really showcase the power of illustration to highlight and share such important events and people.â
âThe students really worked hard on each creating a unique and informative poster that can help spread awareness of these important activists.
Being able to exhibit the posters at the Desmond and Leah Tutu foundation to Celebrate Leah Tutus Legacy is an honour for everyone who worked on the project.â

Date: 27 February 2023
The colours of the rainbow flag show the diversity of the LGBTQIA+ community and the broad, beautiful spectrum of gender and human sexuality.
So it was no surprise that London Metâs first queer safe space, which opened to huge fanfare last week, has been dubbed The Rainbow Room.
Officially opening its doors for the first time on 23 February, the Rainbow Room is the brainchild of Donna Jones, Head of Social work , who came up with the idea three years ago as 'a safe and inclusive space where LGBTQIA+ students can be'.
Itâs "really important that we are visible, that students feel that we are visible and that the university supports that visibility", said Donna, who worked tirelessly to see her idea come to fruition.
She was prompted by the fact that there has been âa lot of discussion around how we didn't hear the LGBTQIA+ studentsâ at the University.
At the grand opening more than 50 supporters packed into the room, just off the Junction cafÃ© in T-101 on the Holloway Campus, which has been newly decorated with lavender couches, colourful beanbags and wall decorations where staff have written about which LGBTQIA+ authors have inspired them most.
Students and staff donated LGBTQIA+ themed books as part of a âBookshelf Socialâ and discussed their experiences and memorable moments to celebrate LGBTQIA+ History Month.
The Rainbow Room "demonstrates our commitment to equality within the LGBTQIA community", said Vice-Chancellor Professor Lynn Dobbs, who gave a short talk to commemorate the occasion.
Under her leadership, London Met has climbed 289 places in the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, reaching 162 this year, and has been awarded a bronze award for its work to create a more inclusive workplace .
Lynn added that London Met is 'pioneering' in its approach to building a community.
"It makes me proud that we have produced a culture that allows people to celebrate.
The fact that the University set the ground roots and then it [the Rainbow Room] was organised by individuals is fabulous," she said.
"I have two sons who are both gay.
I am immensely proud of them and feel passionate about the agenda."
Brian Tutt, Head of Student Experience and Academic Outcomes, School of Social Sciences and Professions and co-head of the LGBTQIA+ Staff Network, said having a physical place to meet will help give the queer community a specific focus within the university.
"It is going to be a great resource and we want everyone to use it," he said.
"For the first time, we've got a dedicated space where students and staff members of the LGBT community, and also colleagues and partners outside in the community, can gather together informally and socially in a safe space."
As the university is embedded within the local community, Donna added that she wants the local community to also be able to access the Rainbow Roomâs resources, support, and space.
"It shows that London Met really cares about queer folks and it is just not a matter of putting it in websites and forgetting about it,â said Avi Ben-Zeev, Senior Lecturer in Psychology, who is trans and recently moved to London Met from San Francisco State University.
âEverything here about EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) could sound like a slogan, but actually, having the resources having the community is heart-warming.
It is a beautiful community place.â
Students were on board as well, listening to staff explain which books they chose for the bring and borrow bookshelf, and eating a selection of treats provided by the university, including smoked salmon, sticky chicken skewers, and vegetarian spring rolls.
Ana Brito, a student activist assistant at the Studentsâ Union, running for VP of Equity and Welfare at LMU, said the initiative is âfantasticâ and finds it incredible to have a safe space for marginalised groups after three years of setting the groundwork.
Gaia Cardone, 21, a Criminology student running for VP activities, said, "I feel it is a great space; I think people will be comfortable here.
Having something so inclusive is amazing, and we can do events such as art and craft, talks, and workshops to get more people involved.

London Metâs clinics are helping organisations and people across the capital make a real difference.
Date: 1 June 2023
Since they were launched in May 2021, London Metâs innovative community clinics have recieved more than 1000 enquiries from businesses in the private, public and third sectors, as well as from individuals in London looking for expert advice.
Coordinated by the London Met Lab: Empowering London , the University's five free or low-cost clinics, which are operated by student and staff volunteers, offer legal advice; sports injury assessment and rehabilitation; support with art, architecture and design community projects, as well as advice for small businesses, charities and social enterprises.
For more than a year, London Metâs Charities and Social Enterprise Clinic has been supporting ParaPride, a London-based empowerment charity that advocates for the visibility, education and awareness of LGBTQ+ disabled people .
London Metâs volunteers worked with ParaPride on several projects, including the launch of their new website and a significant upgrade to their social media channels.

âWe value London Met's support, and we look forward to continuing working on exciting future projects.â
For a small charity, the pro bono support from London Metâs clinic has been a lifeline.
Sophie Cloutterbuck, London Metâs Director of London Engagement, developed the clinics as part of the work of the London Met Lab: Empowering London: âWe know that the current climate is extremely challenging for individuals and businesses in our community, so we created our community clinics to offer them cost-effective or free services that are making a real difference.
âAs a civic university, we believe in being an active member of our local community.
Our clinics are one of the ways we give back to our local communities and to the city of London.â

Through Let's Talk Islington, the Council wanted to understand more about residents’ perceptions and experiences of inequality and their hopes for the future, with the ultimate goal to change the way we work to tackle inequality and create a more equal Islington.
Date: 11 November 2022
London Metâs Head of Social Work , Donna Jones, is working with Islington Council on two major projects to support inclusion and dismantle inequality in the borough.
The first project sees Donna work with filmmakers Nicole Cyrus and Sonny Thaker to identify and explore the experiences of Islingtonâs LGBTQIA+ communities of inequality.
The methodological approach for this project is âVideoVoiceâ, a method that has been used to develop new understandings of the experiences and needs of  LGBTQIA+ communities who have been under-represented in previous projects.
VideoVoice is an approach that uses documentary video filmmaking to explore personal experiences, and the videos are accompanied by narratives that tell the story behind the video.
VideoVoice is a form of participatory action research.
Participatory action research emphasises researching with people rather than about them with the researcher and participants developing knowledge and greater awareness together that can lead to improvement and social change.
The second project, âStorytelling with Eldersâ recognises the value of âstoryâ and the ability of storytelling to build empathy and engagement.
Stories do not need to be written down and illustrated to be worthy of retelling.
It starts from the position that a good story is just as valuable to the teller as the listener, especially if itâs shared in warm conversation, with room for thoughtful â or emotional â pauses of remembrance.
Donna Jones is leading the project and has worked with a group of identified elders living in Islington to further understand their experiences of poverty and inequality.
The project aimed to foster a sense of community, recognising that the elders may be isolated and experiencing loneliness, especially as we are coming out of an extended period of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Story Gatherers Merita Avdyli and Ricardo Pereira Carvalho worked with individual elders to listen to stories of their experiences, using prompts and a personal memento identified by the elder as having personal meaning to them.
The stories were recorded and transcribed, with consent, so that themes could be identified, analysed and passed on to Islington Council
Elders were photographed by a professional photographer with their memento so that their image could accompany their story at an exhibition which highlights all the projects developed as part of the Letâs Talk Islington initiative.

Date: 20 February 2023
According to recent research data as reported by the Guardian , fathers in the UK are now more involved in care duties in the family home, with data suggesting that this has gone up by a third since the pandemic.
Fathers are increasingly working from home and striving for better work life balances.
As a result, many are seeking better legislation and flexible working policies to suit family demands.
As encouraging as this is, Kevin explains that very little is known about the experiences of men and fathers as care givers, âThe Covid 19 pandemic caused us to all grind to a halt and pause for thought.
Equimundo: the Centre for Masculinities and Social Justice recently shared a report into the organisations, academics and professionals invested in men as care givers, titled â Who cares about Americaâs Male Care Givers?
Laying the Groun d work for a National Strategy to Support Fathers.
â This report raises questions about how men as fathers are responding to uncertainty and the multitude of challenges facing todayâs familiesâ
The challenges, Kevin suggests, include the current cost of living crisis, and soaring inflation rates, and readjusting to life following the covid 19 pandemic.
âNow more than ever, we need to gain a better understanding of how families are traversing this difficult terrainâ
As a father and Challenge Champ on the London Met Lab: Empowering London initiative this is a social cause close to Kevinâs heart.
âI have been fortunate to support research projects by organisations that are committed to improving outcomes for children by enabling fathers as male care givers and hearing the voices of fathers and understanding their experiences, these are key to this process.â
âI have proudly been working with the community research organisation Centric and The Social Innovation Partnership (TSIP) on the initiative âDaddies Voices.â This initiative is funded by Impact on Urban Health as part of Guyâs and St Thomasâ Charity and has come at a time of huge change for families nationally, with recent research suggesting a monumental culture shift in care duties as a result of the Covid 19 outbreak.
The traditional archetype of the âbread winnerâ is no longer tenable, and these issues continue to hide in plain sight, with some men buckling under the social pressure to meet societal expectations, resulting in increased acute mental health problems with men three times more likely to take their own lives.â
Kevinâs work aims to change current narratives and help achieve gender parity, especially in matters such as childcare duties.
The key element to this change is education.
âMy research project âPromoting Positive Father Involvementâ consisted of a course programme delivered with social work students, and newly qualified practitioners in the UK and USA .
The initiative applied a coaching and Problem Based Learning (PBL) methodology that supports the critical reflection of father involvement as part of practice.
This has also been adopted as part of London Metâs Social Work undergraduate and postgraduate courses.â
Kevin has seen further success, with the North East London Teaching Partnership (NELTP) adopting his methodology in a bid to improve Social Work practice .
Looking to the future, Kevin hopes that research and supporting lectures continues to shine a light on the issues facing men through education and inspires students.
âEnabling the next generation of professionals to support men and fathers, particularly, men in crisis, is an under-resourced area of professional development.
I personally wish to live in a world where all professionals are effective in supporting fathers in co-parenting, following separation and divorce.
This has become a key challenge for me, since identifying the issue as part of supporting the âDaddies Voicesâ forum.
Teaching professionals to identify help-seeking behaviours in men facing challenges is pivotal.â
Kevin will be sharing his work as part of an upcoming webinar titled âThe Many Faces of Fatherhoodâ as part of the menâs Mental Health Series , taking place on Tuesday 21 February at 1pm.

Date: 11 May 2023
London Met researcher and course leader Torange Khonsari, also member of the Islington Inequality Taskforce, has helped to launch the "Taskforce on Inequality in Islington Final Report" with her expertise.
This report shed findings on the circle of inequality in which daily pressure from deprivation damages well-being, leading to low self-confidence, physical and mental ill-heath, a loss of agency and of influence.
These factors exacerbate deprivation as individuals face higher barriers to securing decent work, consideration from those in positions of power, and control over their future.
The report included what practical steps the council can take to tackle these challenges and make lasting changes in the borough.
Islington is London's sixth most impoverished borough, with affluent neighbourhoods adjacent to deprived ones.
Residents in the most deprived neighbourhoods may expect to live nearly ten years less than those in the least deprived areas, which is significantly higher than the London average.
Additionally, 28% of children under the age of 16 live in low-income households, which is the highest proportion in London.
The Inequality Taskforce was established to develop recommendations for how Islington Council can go about addressing inequality, poverty and deprivation.
Theyâre comprised of civic, academic, and business leaders with local and national knowledge across health, poverty reduction, and education.
It is a key part of the Letâs Talk Islington engagement exercise with the boroughâs residents to discover their hopes and aspirations for Islington.
A tiered approach was designed with the standard mass engagement survey and community workshops for residents to share stories and whatâs important to them on their own terms.
âWe talked about that power relationship.
Service giving is not that empowering, because it creates a dependency culture in a setting where there simply isnât enough resources.
The councilâs role needs to shift instead towards collaboration and facilitation,â said Torange.
âAll these systems need mapping to see what we have to change to comply with a more empowering, agency-giving approach.
Because if youâre in a system where you have agency, where you feel valued, thatâs where you start to actually address a lot of the inequalities that weâve been talking about.â
Now that the report has been released, the Islington Inequality Taskforce is developing a 2030 plan that will incorporate all of the learnings to date and provide a clear roadmap to achieving a more equitable Islington.
It will focus on the objective of enhancing people's control over decisions that impact them.
Moreover, it will encompass the pledge to increase community influence in Islington and continue innovation in this area.
The Taskforce on Inequality in Islington Final Report can be found published online .

London Met's Sophie Cloutterbuck has been announced as the Chair of the London Higher Civic Network.
Sophie is the University's Director of London Engagement and heads its flagship civic engagement initiative, the London Met Lab: Empowering London .
London Higher is the representative body for the UK's higher education powerhouse in London.
They recently launched the London Higher Civic Map , which contains over 150 examples of university-led civic activity in the capital, and is the most ambitious attempt in the UK higher education sector to date to delineate the varied and vital contribution that universities make to their local region.
This came as part of a campaign calling for the Government to recognise the vital role of the capital's universities in the Covid-19 recovery process by launching the first-ever pan-regional map of civic university activity in England.
The map showcases the collective efforts of the capital's universities and higher education colleges to benefit local communities and positively impact society across six core areas of: health, education, business, creative, community cohesion and the environment.
It was compiled in collaboration with members of the London Higher Civic Network.From London Met, the highlighted projects are:

Dr Diana Beech, Chief Executive Officer of London Higher said; "The scale of the recovery that lies ahead for London as we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic is enormous.
To help the capital get back on its feet quickly, policymakers should be looking for ways to harness the transformative power and collaboration that is already in abundance across the capital's leading public and private-sector institutions.
"London's higher education institutions are true lifebuoys for their localitiesâalways visible to those around them, and ready to help keep their capital and its people afloat in times of crisis.
It is my hope that policymakers will recognise the immense contribution made by universities to the city and nation's recovery and make them the first port of call when addressing future challenges."

London Met's Director of London Engagement, Sophie Cloutterbuck, today took part in the Civic University Network showcase, which demonstrated the profound impact that universities are having within their local communities.
Alongside Sophie, the contributors included Dr Emily Burns from Queen Mary, University of London, and Gail May from the University of East London.
An 'in conversation' session saw a discussion of the experiences of these three London universities and how they work together on civic projects,in partnership with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, including work experience posts for students with grassroots London organisations, evaluating crime reduction initiatives and deploying the expertise of their universities' academics to help advance for example policy in Public Health.
The event provided an opportunity for the speakers to showcase the best practices and projects of universities engaged with civic work, as well as the challenges they are facing.
They also spoke about the next steps to creating a formal civic engagement agreement, and held a broader conversation with a team from Greater Manchester, who have also been working with different universities in the local area about their different approaches.
Sophie launched London Met's flagship civic engagement strategy, the London Met Lab: Empowering London in 2020.
The Lab's mission is to tackle the inequalities facing London, improve people's lives and deliver social justice.
The Lab works with over 600 partner organisations including local authorities, NHS Trusts, sports clubs, third sector organisations, higher education institutions and businesses to advance these aims.
It focuses on six key areas - crime, discrimination, the environment, health improvement, poverty and deprivation, and social wealth â and brings together London Met staff, students and partner organisations to co-design solutions to these social challenges.
The London Met Lab was recently praised by Jules Pipe CBE, Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills.

"I'm particularly interested to see how this approach of getting students to work with London's community organisations on key challenges that their community is facing develops in the future."
The event was hosted by the Civic Engagement Network, which supports universities to develop and embed civic aspirations at an institutional level, as well as working with government and strategic partners to ensure that a university's geographic role and responsibility is used more effectively as an agent to drive positive societal change.

The University, which has been committed to paying the London Living Wage since 2014, joins the campaign to make Islington North Londonâs first Living Wage Borough.
Date: 6 July 2021
London Met is proud to join forces with a group of seventeen local public, voluntary and private sector employers as part of an action plan to make Islington North London's first "Living Wage Borough."
The University has been committed to paying the London Living Wage since 2014, and is now calling on its neighbours to make the change through the campaign led by Islington Council.
Together with organisations including London Met, Whittington Health and Archway Tavern, Islington Council has committed to ambitious plans to double the number of Living Wage accredited employers and workers over the next three years.
Sophie Cloutterbuck, Director of London Engagement said, "London Met is committed to being a fair, equitable and progressive institution.
Everyone deserves a Living Wage, and we are proud to support Islington's campaign, which should see more than 3000 more Islington workers receiving the London Living Wage in the next three years."
Matthew Prestage, student and social media ambassador for London Met said, " I work a flexible role which works really well with my studies.
If I have a really busy period at university, especially around exams, I can dial back my hours, then ramp them up when I'm less busy.
I wouldn't be able to dial back my hours during the busy times if I didn't have the London Living Wage to fall back on, so it couples really well with the fact that I am a student.
"Being paid the London Living Wage means there's a great deal of peace of mind.
Living in London can be quite expensive between looking after yourself, rent, and everything else.
Pandemic-aside, the London Living Wage means I can enjoy all the best aspects of living in London without having to worry too much about money."
The Living Wage is the UK's only wage rate based on the cost of living.
Accredited employers commit to pay workers a minimum of Â£10.85 in London, and Â£9.50 outside of London in order to cover their everyday needs.
There are now 221 Living Wage employers within Islington Borough.
However, despite a significant growth in Living Wage employers over the past year, there are still 21,000 (12.6%) jobs in Islington that pay below the real Living Wage.
The Action Group will work together to increase the number of Living Wage jobs in Islington.
Laura Gardiner, Director of the Living Wage Foundation, said:"The incredible challenges of the past year have been felt by thousands of workers and families, in Islington, London and the rest of the UK.
Many have struggled to keep their heads above water.
"That's why it's so encouraging to see employers come together to drive the development of good jobs with a real Living Wage.
If we are to recover from this crisis, we will need to see more boroughs, towns and cities follow Islington's leadership, and commit to provide workers with the security and stability of a real Living Wage."

Date: 25 November 2021
London Metropolitan University celebrated the first year successes of its flagship civic engagement initiative, the London Met Lab ; and its sector-leading Centre for Equity & Inclusion , which focuses on addressing inequalities within Higher Education.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan delivered a video address to approximately 100 London Met staff, students, partners and key figures from the local community, who were in attendance to mark the achievements of the Lab and the Centre over the last year.
Since its launch in  2020, the London Met Lab has partnered with over 600 organisations including local authorities, charities, NHS trusts, social enterprises and businesses, taking practical action to make the capital healthier, fairer and more just.
The Lab works to bring London Metâs academic expertise to co-create solutions to the social challenges which disproportionately affect the communities that the university serves.
For example, through research projects exploring Covid-restriction compliance in North London; developing a public health framework for youth knife crime in Camden; developing new public artworks, designed by students, to Aldgateâs Petticoat Lane Market; and bringing students to plant over 400 trees in Tower Hamlets.
The Centre for Equity and Inclusion, also officially launched  in 2020, sits at the heart of London Met as the ideological driving force behind its pedagogy, student experience and workplace culture.
The Centre has become the catalyst through which London Met actualises its commitment to social justice.
The Centre has recently launched its Race Equity Strategy, which aims to transform the experience of Black and minoritised students at the University, act as a catalyst for changes across the sector, and build links between the University and the local community.
Through the Centre, London Met students have the opportunity to partner in equity programmes which, for example, seek to improve the curriculum, inclusivity of the student experience and raise awareness of important issues such as sexual violence.
Deputy Mayor of London for Planning, Regeneration and Skills, Jules Pipe, said: "As London recovers from the pandemic, we are working hard in City Hall to ensure the capital becomes a greener, fairer, safer and more prosperous city.
I would like to congratulate the University on the first anniversary of the London Met Lab and the Centre for Equity and Inclusion, and all the work they have done so far in helping to create a city that reflects the communities that call it home."
Vice-Chancellor of London Met, Professor Lynn Dobbs said: "Throughout the pandemic, London Met's staff and students have responded to the call for action to support our wonderful city through knowledge-exchange initiatives and on-the-ground activities.
Nowhere exemplifies this better than our London Met Labs and the Centre for Equity and Inclusion, which despite the constraints of COVID-19, have led the way in civic engagement and social justice.
Together, we have worked to further the ambitions of the many brilliant social enterprises, businesses and civic organisations in our city who are equally committed to ensuring inclusive economic and social recovery."
Director of the Centre for Equity and Inclusion at London Met, Dr Zainab Khan said: "The challenges of inequality in Higher Education are well documented.
The Centre for Equity and Inclusion, in partnership with staff and students across London Met is dedicated to addressing disparities in order to deliver fair outcomes and authentic inclusion.
"The publication of our first year activities is an open invitation to the sector to join in undertaking more progressive equity work.
There is much work to be done and I am so proud of what this team of trailblazers has achieved so far.
Director of London Engagement at London Met, Sophie Cloutterbuck said: "Over the last year, the London Met Lab has worked with stakeholders in the local community to find solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing London.
Whether it is investigating the drivers of crime, working to support local peopleâs health and employment, or creating innovative projects to ensure that London becomes carbon neutral, we are tackling crucial issues head-on alongside many partners from business, local government and civic society."

Date: 27 October 2020
A Â£10,000 grant will enable Dr James Alexander, in partnership with Camden Council, to deliver a major project focused on youth safety.
The project will assess the progress that has been made towards the recommendations made by the Councilâs Youth Safety Task Force, which advocates for the recognition of youth knife crime as a public health issue.
The public health model recognises that many different factors affecting young people contribute to different behaviours.
It also accepts that early intervention is vital to mitigate against the factors that make involvement in youth crime more likely, and for support to have a positive influence.
The recommendations made by the task force include promoting early help services to families including parent-led programmes, supporting police engagement with young people and finding ways to foster greater trust, and developing programmes to equip young people with the skills and resilience needed to make positive choices, with a focus on those moving from primary to secondary school.
Throughout the study, there will be a focus on understanding the role that race disproportionality plays in relation to youth safety within the borough.
As Dr Alexander, Senior Lecturer in Criminology , explains: âNot only will there be an analysis of the representation of different ethnicities within the offending cohort, the study will also seek to explore why any over-representation may exist.
âThe research will include an analysis of whether there is any disproportionality in terms of which groups different interventions are targeting and whether any identified targeting is justified.
There will also be a consideration of whether those initiating interventions are representative of the targeted service users.â
Dr Alexander will be working with a number of local partners, including schools, youth clubs, safeguarding hubs and the Camden Youth Offending Team (YOT) to assess the implementation of the Youth Safety Task Force strategy and to support further action plans going forwards.

At the same time, it aims to change the narrative and challenge the negative perception of the care system.
Entitled Sanciaâs Podcast , the channel offers a safe, space that gives adults with care experience a platform to have their voices heard through sharing their stories and experiences in the social care system.
As well as drawing upon professional advice and information, Sanciaâs Podcast aims to change the narrative and challenge the negative perception of the care system.
A document produced by Her Majestyâs Prison and Probation Service found that care leavers are more likely to have a criminal conviction, and may have experienced unnecessary criminalisation.
They are estimated to represent between 24 and 27 per cent of the adult prison population, despite less than 1% of under 18s entering local authority care each year.
In addition, according to the Department for Education, in 2018-19 only 13% of pupils who were looked after by Social Services entered higher education compared to 43% of the general public.
Sancia explained her motivation for starting the podcast, saying, "By becoming a Youth Studies student at London Metropolitan University I have broken the stigma of NEET Care leavers, and the statistic of unnecessary criminalisation.
"The Youth Studies course has enhanced my development through knowledge, and the continuous support from the course leader Aine Woods and the tutors are incredible, their passion shone throughout.
"By knowing my rights, the social constructs of society and by being self-aware and reflective, I can now use the power of my knowledge in practice to aid other young people in society."

Date: 08 March 2021
Sarah Haid, Director of Better Safe Communities, works with over 100 London Met students through the London Met Labâs work-based learning module, Empowering London.
For International Womenâs Day, we caught up with her to discuss the inspiration sheâs drawn from women throughout her life and career, and the advice she would give to others looking to set up social enterprises.
My mother is a huge source of inspiration.
When I was in Sheffield, she worked tirelessly to help Somali refugees fleeing the conflict and war in the 1990s.
Both our homes in Sheffield were a stop-over for families fleeing for their lives after the military was bombing their own people in Somalia.
Thousands of Somalis were put on humanitarian flights to Europe to save their lives, many millions fled to neighbouring African countries and over 500.000 were killed immediately in the country.
Before the arrivals could be processed for sheltered accommodation in the respective cities, many had to stay with Somali families who were willing to give up their bedrooms and lounges to house them for a few days at a time.
I remember in the 1990s, our homes becoming like reception centres and mother standing in the kitchen making large portions of food and mobilising the social support needs with no financial support at all, just the willingness of local Somalis to come and help those who had been traumatised, providing them with food and shelter.
Many of them were single mothers who lost their husbands to the heavy bombing.
Many orphans' parents were killed and were quickly rushed onto UN flights to Europe.
My mother became known to the local council as the link between the new arrivals and the help that was required for sheltered accommodations.
I saw her spending hours counselling traumatised people where 24 hours ago they were in a war zone and 24 hours later, they are in safety but they had seen things we only see in action films.
She was inspirational because gave all of herself, her time to crying women who were grieving for their loved ones, the life they had and the brutal rapes they endured.
She was their voice and interpreter during the difficult times in their lives and today as she lives in Somalia, in peace and stability.
She is famous for her humanitarian efforts by building centres of hope and peace for families returning back home.
It was amazing to see first-hand compassion and care all done without no support.
From those early days, I became overwhelmed with the suffering of others and as I went through my career and study, I always gave up time to social justice issues.
My experience of working with London Met has been amazing, there is something unique and special about it.
Every time I work with the personnel, they seem to have the right way of responding to the needs and voices of the community settings, they are instilled with the sense of collaboration and desire to make a social change.
I always have the sense that this sense of community support and compassion must come from the Vice-Chancellor, who I havenât met, but, I have heard she is eager to see students gain a better understanding of local social needs and how this can influence the work of London Met.
This vision is so admirable and transformational and it will only bring the respect of the local communities who are suffering the most.
The best advice I would give to women is to surround yourself with people that truly care about your well-being and success.
If a good person gives you criticism, it is because they care and they donât want you to keep making the same mistakes.
Always be humble, kind, considerate and never arrogant and know there is always someone who is more intelligent and wiser and you still have room to improve in this world in which we live.
You can learn from bad experiences because you can reflect on how best to respond in another similar situation.
For women to be successful in business, you need to have successful relationships, be honourable, be on time and respectful of peopleâs beliefs and cultures - we all have something to learn.
Every minute and day I run Better Safe Communities is because I love what I do, so whatever you do you MUST LOVE WHAT YOU DO.
If you dread what you do you must try your best to make your work something you enjoy.

Date: 20 July 2021
London Met was delighted to sponsor the category for Teacher of the Year at the 2021 Islington Education Awards.
Now in their third year, the awards are a celebration of the ambition, innovation and excellence in teaching and learning in the borough.
Hosted by children's author and TV personality Konnie Huq, and with awards announced by Christopher Eccleston, Tamzin Outhwaite and Denise Welch, this year's ceremony honoured the work of the incredible teaching and support staff in Islington's schools during an unprecedented time.
With many challenges faced by schools and students alike, the past 18 months have seen education professionals rise to the huge task of evolving, inventing and adapting to completely new ways of working, in addition to providing an essential link to normality for children during lockdown.
The awards recognise and applaud those achievements and also help to inspire an Islington pride within our excellent schools.
Sophie Cloutterbuck, Director of London Engagement at London Met said, " Teachers have worked incredibly hard to continue educating students throughout a very challenging year.
London Met has a long-held commitment to enhancing opportunities through education, and we are delighted to celebrate the achievements of our extraordinary local schools and colleges at the Islington Education Awards through sponsorship of the 2021 Teacher of the Year category." "It's probably no surprise that this year's nominees were universally inspiring, but I continue to be awestruck by the dedication of those working in Islington education" said Maggie Elliott, Chair of the Islington Community of Schools.
"I hope that this awards event goes a little way to thanking everyone in our community for pulling together for the children and young people of Islington in this pandemic year."
The awards are supported by Islington Council, whose leader Cllr Kaya Comer-Schwartz said: "It's an honour and a privilege to have the opportunity to celebrate Islington's inspiring teaching and support staff, who have risen admirably and continued to educate and nurture our young people through the profound difficulties that the pandemic and government action has forced on them.
"We are determined to give Islington's young people the best possible start in life and our settings are at the heart of that ambition.
They equip our young people with the skills, confidence and resilience to give them the best chance to go on and succeed."
Cllr Michelline Safi Ngongo, the council's Executive Member for Children, Young People and Families said: "For the last 18 months, staff working in Islington's educational settings have overcome unparalleled professional challenges.
These awards are a very welcome opportunity to celebrate their dedication, creativity and determination to support and inspire Islington's children and young people."

Our Commitment to Inclusion
At London Met, our commitment to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and equitable environment is central to our Mission and Values.
The Supreme Court Ruling: On 16 April 2025, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the term âsexâ in the Equality Act 2010 should be interpreted as referring to biological sex.
While this legal clarification may influence how single-sex spaces are defined under the law, it does not change our responsibilities to support all members of our community, including transgender and non-binary individuals.
Our Next Steps: We await further guidance from relevant regulatory bodies, including the Office for Students and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and will review and update our policies and practices as appropriate to ensure legal compliance and to uphold our values.

At London Met, we are proud to have a university community that is diverse in age, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, gender identity and many other characteristics.
It is for this reason that striving for inclusive language use is so important to us â we want to use words that signify respect, recognise the nuances of our lived experience, and truly promote equitable outcomes.
We know that language is fluid.
As we learn more about one another, our understanding of language develops and some words become no longer appropriate.
This guide is a reflection of this; although there is suggested language and examples of what to avoid, it is most important to apply general inclusive language principles and be open to constantly learning and unlearning.
We welcome suggestions and alterations â this is a living resource, reflective of our community.

Continuing our historic commitment to widening access to higher education, in 2020 London Met launched our distinctive Education for Social Justice Framework (ESJF), driven primarily by our belief that our curricula and practice should align with principles of equity, with who our students are, and the challenges facing London and its communities.
In keeping with the University’s mission “to transform lives through the power of education”, our holistic, values-based ESJF builds on our rich tradition of inclusive practice and critical pedagogy in seeking to provide education that enables all our diverse students to gain knowledge and awareness, to develop their potential and to achieve success that empowers them in their careers and to become agents of progressive social change in the world.
Integral to our social justice, equity and inclusivity agenda is our quest to eliminate differential outcomes between White and Black as well as minoritised students, particularly with respect to continuation and degree-awarding gaps, and ensure fair outcomes for all – refashioning our educational practice in partnership with our students.
Following a pilot phase (2020-21) and a university-wide training programme (2021-22) for fostering culture change and promoting and sharing good practice - it encompassed Valued-Added metrics, “Inclusive Behaviours” sessions on equity literacy and practice, and ESJ Pedagogy workshops covering all ESJF Dimensions - our ESJF is being implemented in all courses.
During those years and 2022-23, course validations and periodic reviews, as well our Course Enhancement Process, have furnished opportunities to re/design our provision in alignment with the ESJF, while also disseminating striking examples of inclusive practice.
As a guide to enhancing practice, key principles for ESJ pedagogy, propagated via the training, include:
Application of our ESJF has fed into course changes such as more inclusive content, learning materials and assessment, informed by student feedback or contributions to curricular or assessment design, or even co-investigation of the hidden curriculum.
Initial encouraging indications of the positive impact our ESJF combined with a range of related initiatives across the student journey – from improved pre-entry guidance and induction to enhanced academic and personal support and the embedding of career education in the curriculum – include the reduction in the ethnicity degree-awarding gap from 17% to 9%, and increased ratings on the National Student Satisfaction (NSS) survey, comparing 2023 with 2020 results: overall “positivity rate” of 82.8% vs previous overall satisfaction score of 80%, plus higher ratings for teaching (85.6% vs 83.1%), assessment and feedback (83.7% vs 76.4%) and academic support (85.2% vs 78.9%).
All these particular NSS scores are above the sector average.
More impressively, London Met is now ranked as one the best universities in the country for teaching quality (9 th out of 129), student experience (10 th ) and social inclusion (in the top quarter), according to the Times Good University Guide 2024 .
The transformative impact of implementing our ESJF is also reflected in the remarkable improvement achieved by London Met in gaining a silver award in the latest Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) 2023 appraisal.
The TEF judging panel evaluated the areas of teaching, assessment and feedback, learning environment, course content and student engagement as “outstanding”, and learning resources as “very high quality”.
A vivid flavour of this highly commended teaching is captured and celebrated in this compendium of noteworthy case studies of existing inclusive practice from a variety of academic disciplines, inspired by our ESJF.
May these exemplars, in turn, serve as a catalyst and inspiration for further teaching innovation across subject areas, thereby generating fresh instances of successful practice as additional compendium contributions in the future.

London Metâs Race Equity Strategy 2020/21â â 2024/25, developed in consultation with staff and students, reflects our commitment to ensure that we deliver real change across the University.
The full scale of our activities is not captured in the plan because our approach is truly holistic; every individual in every department of the University is part of the solution to create the systems and environment where everyone is respected and valued.
This plan has been developed in consultation with Black and minoritised staff and students, and will be subject to monitoring and evaluation.

From SXSW London to Universities UKâs national conference, Sharon Lloyd is helping shape conversations on equity, identity and inclusion, both within higher education and beyond it.
Date: 17 June 2025
Sharon Lloyd, Deputy Director of London Metropolitan Universityâs Centre for Equity & Inclusion , brought her work on digital dignity, equity, and institutional transformation to two major platforms last month, connecting with public, cultural, and higher education audiences alike.
On 3 June, Sharon spoke at the inaugural South by Southwest (SXSW) London festival, joining the panel Digital Dignity in the Identity Era at Rich Mix.
The session explored how identity and agency are expressed in online spaces and featured creative leaders including Vogue 100 Innovator Dr Alex Box and digital artist Sam Chester, moderated by Philip Delamore.
SXSW London marked the European debut of the renowned festival, originally founded in Austin, Texas.
Held in East London, Europeâs hub of creativity and technology, it brought together artists, technologists, and global changemakers from across Europe, Africa and Asia to foster cross-cultural innovation and dialogue.
Later that week, Sharon joined senior leaders at Improving Equality in Higher Education 2025 , a national conference hosted by Universities UK.
The session, chaired by Professor Charles Egbu, Vice-Chancellor of Leeds Trinity University, focused on accelerating inclusive policy and practice across British universities.
âThese events offered a chance to share our approach to equity with both cultural and sector audiences, expanding the reach of our work and London Metâs mission,â said Lloyd.
âProgress depends on engaging within higher education and beyond.
These were two powerful platforms to do just that.â
Sharonâs recent engagements reflect the Centreâs commitment to connecting institutional strategy with real-world conversations on digital identity, cultural equity, and sector transformation.
Work continues on the Centreâs new programme of external engagement and partnerships for 2025â2027.

Date: 21 February 2025
On 20 February, London Metropolitan University celebrated LGBTQIA+ History Month with a special event in the Rainbow Room that brought together students, staff, and the Special Collections team to reflect on the rich and evolving LGBTQIA+ history on campus.
The evening began with a presentation by the universityâs Head of Special Collections, David Baldwin, who then introduced selected records from the University archive.
Baldwin touched on why the archives play a crucial role in life on campus today, âwe wanted to try and find different histories that were represented so that students would then find their stories within the archive.â
The team highlighted historical documents that showcase the vibrant LGBTQIA+ history not only at London Met but off-campus too, âA lot of the campaign work that students were championing was in response to events occurring off-campusâ.
In the Rainbow Room, a new living wall timeline visually showcased key events from both UK-wide LGBTQIA+ history and significant moments at London Met.
âLondon Met has always been great in providing opportunities and spaces for staff, but we found most consistently the Student Union has a rich history of moving stories and driving change forward.â London Metâs archives stretch back 178 years, with the first record of the â Gay So c ietyâ beginning in 1974.
The event offered an opportunity for connection.
Students and staff shared personal stories, engaging in meaningful conversations about their experiences and what is to come at London Met.
Co-leader of the LGBTQIA+ Staff Network, Dr.
Sebastian Cordoba, shared London Metâs remarkable progress within Stonewallâs âWorkplace Equality Indexâ.
âIn 2023 we were ranked 551 st in the UK, as of last year, we jumped up to 102 nd .â Cordoba hopes that next yearâs submission will push London Met into the top 100 employers for workplace inclusion in the UK.
Diving deep into the archives of London Met, you can find âfantastic and rich resourcesâ says the Special Collections Team, with some of âthe most interesting and inspiring material held at the institutionâ about Staff and Student involvement in LGBTQIA+ representation.
The event not only celebrated LGBTQIA+ history but also underpinned the importance of continuing to document and preserve the diverse experiences that have shaped London Metâs community over the years.
âWe are really hoping this space and events like these will continue for the future, so that we can continue making important history at London Met.â  - Dr.
Sebastian Cordoba.

Date: 26 March 2024
Professor Marcia Wilson, who joined London Metropolitan University as Pro Vice-Chancellor for Student Experience and Institutional Equity at the end of last year, is an experienced academic leader.
She gained national attention as the founding Dean of the Office for Institutional Equity at the University of East London (UEL), a trailblazing department that has become a model for educational institutions across the UK.
But Marcia's journey into senior leadership has been anything but conventional.
"My early career began with a love of sport so I decided to pursue that area of study," she says, reflecting on a path that began in the London Borough of Newham and took her to the United States to earn a Master's from the University of Houston and a PhD in sport psychology from the University of Iowa.
After a period of work teaching in South Carolina and working with athletes, she returned to the UK to leave her mark at UEL and the Open University before bringing her wealth of experience to London Met.
"I've never accepted the notion that our students' backgrounds determine their limits," She says.
"I feel I can speak from experience because I lived in some of the same areas of London as our students.
I know how hard it can be to thrive without the right support, especially when fighting structural and organisational barriers at every step."
Growing up in Newham, East London, a stone's throw from West Ham Unitedâs famous football ground, inspired the start of her academic journey which began with an undergraduate degree in Physical Education and led to pioneering work in Sports Science and Psychology.
The competitive mindset and strategic approach she learnt through sport have significantly impacted many aspects of her career, especially her advocacy through initiatives like Athena SWAN and Race Equity.
Only a few months into her role at London Met, she's already making a difference.
"I've met loads of people here, and they're passionate and incredibly committed to making a positive difference for our students," she says.
She's also collaborating closely with Mandy Bentham, the Dean of Students, on timetabling, student records, and student services.
Marcia is also building partnerships with London Metâs Students' Union (SU), particularly with the SU CEO Bethan Dudas, SU President, Awesome Olasope and the Sabbatical Officers Manpreet Kaur, Tamika Chambers and Mojahar Ali.
"Their enthusiasm, determination and professionalism are palpable," she comments.
She is particularly excited about establishing a foodbank for all London Met students that will be fully open in the coming weeks.
As part of her remit for institutional equity, Marcia is working closely with colleagues in the university's Centre for Equity and Inclusion .
She is spearheading initiatives aimed at addressing institutional disparities affecting Global Majority students and staff.
"It's not about student deficit; it's about what we can do to address institutional and structural deficits," she emphasises.
âPeople need to understand, we have the power to ensure that every student reaches their full potential."
Throughout her career, Marcia has leveraged data to propel her work forward.
When making the case for creating the Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) at UEL, data helped her demonstrate how focusing on equality, diversity, and inclusion made a tangible difference across the institution.
It transformed the initiative from a 'tick box exercise' to a core part of the university's mission.
Vision and courage are two words that resonate deeply with Marcia's approach.
Establishing the OIE at UEL was pioneering, setting a benchmark for universities across the country.
"If we're serious about social justice, we need to be radical," she asserts.
One example she cites is the work London Met has begun with several Historically Black Colleges and Universities group members in the US.
"I think we can do some amazing work with HBCUs," she comments, highlighting this initiative, established by Vice-Chancellor Professor Lynn Dobbs, as just one example of innovative thinking which can challenge the status quo, build international collaborations, and enrich the educational experience at London Met.
As the interview concludes, Marcia reflects on what students and staff can expect from her leadership style.
"For me, itâs about having the courage to do something different and being prepared to be accountable if a strategy doesnât work out.
I want to ensure all voices are heard, and people are valued, respected, and seen.
Everyone has something to contribute, and if we donât listen, we miss out."
Professor Marcia Wilson

Date: 14 February 2024
Mia Nembhard: Welcome Phyll!
Itâs good to get some time with you before the annual lecture .
We're familiar with different terms in this line of work: EDI, Equity, Social justice work, but for many organisations itâs relatively new to have teams of people focussing on this.
At the same time, when I look on LinkedIn it seems like everyone is doing D&I!
Which youâd think is a good thing.
For many, EDI work canât be neatly separated from your personal practice â what you believe in reflects the intention of your work.
But there are incidences of organisations funding this work to be performative.
Is this something youâve noticed and how do you navigate the working world of EDI, especially with a background in community organising?
Lady Phyll: Organisations donât exist in isolation, they exist in a world which is beautifully diverse.
Therefore, to exist, EDI needs to be at the heart of organisations.
There are occasions where EDI work is done as a tick box exercise and something businesses think they must be seen to do.
When the intention is not to better the business, and the experience of those working within it, itâs clearly inauthentic and ultimately harms the organisation.
I navigate that by reminding businesses and leaders that EDI is not a function or one team, it is the makeup of a company.
People are not robots, and every employee is an individual; so EDI is about every single individual and ensuring they are seen and heard.
MN: Your contributions to âcommunityâ are seen as exemplary and there is a real range of work you do (more on that at the event), but I wondered how you approach developing your own standards for what you do and how you do it?
LP: Itâs all about getting better and better.
Each event, each achievement, each moment is a chance to help, platform and celebrate communities, and Iâm driven to keep pushing until every underrepresented community steps into their power.
It is not easy and comes with great personal sacrifice, but the end goal is in sight and very much worth it.
MN: Within the Centre we have a range of programmes that range from cultural competency (Tik-Tok style consent training) to disrupting traditional methods of knowledge production through our student partnership schemes, with the aim of responding to the needs of the University community and providing opportunities for all to succeed.
The work takes time to build with the right care and consideration, it needs to speak to people through mediums they engage with.
On the other hand, the nature of EDI work is that standards change (and quickly) so there is a need to be quite reactive.
How do you remain up to date with best practice?
And what are the enduring principles that in your opinion will forever characterise meaningful versions of your work arenât outdated?
LP: Youâre right that the standards change quickly, however I would say that there are core principles that do not change, and itâs all around valuing the voice of the individual.
I stay up to date by surrounding myself with those individuals, hearing what their challenges are and giving them space to tell others about their learned experiences.
The Centre for Equity and Inclusion Annual Lecture 2024 (Inspire): In Conversation with Lady Phyll takes place on Wednesday 7 March 2024, 6-8pm.
Book tickets via Eventbrite .
We welcome staff, students and members of the public to this event.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/london-met-achieves-silver-in-teaching-excellence-framework:
Date: 28 September 2023
London Met has received a silver award in the UK Governmentâs measure of teaching and student experience excellence in the higher education sector.
Notably, a gold award was given for the student experience category.
The results of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) were announced on 28 September, with results valid for the next four years.
The judging panel responsible for awarding TEF classifications analysed a number of metrics and evidence-based supporting information.
This included a submission from students, which also demonstrated an outstanding student experience for a wide range of student groups.
Further to the initial scores, the TEF panel marked nothing below the level of âvery high qualityâ, specifically:
The university was applauded for providing examples of its tailored approaches to differing student needs.
The outstanding quality of support for under-represented groups was also highlighted in the feedback, as well as compelling evidence to suggest various strategies are having a positive impact.
London Met is proud of its commitment to student partnership work and social justice, particularly through dedicated Centre for Equity & Inclusion initiatives and The Education for Social Justice Framework .
Following a change in leadership in 2018, a renewed focus on culture has taken place throughout the university.
The corporate strategy has been built with student experience in mind, so a gold award in this category speaks to the heavy investment working with under-represented communities, including a commitment to race equity , outlined in an ongoing strategic plan.
It also indicates the Student Success strand of the Strategic Plan is having a positive impact.
Lynn Dobbs, Vice-Chancellor at London Met, commented: âThe feedback we receive from TEF assessments and all surveys looking at our education practices informs the direction of London Metâs student experience and outcome strategy.
To be recognised as a university of silver award standard is a testament to the hard work and dedication that has gone into making this a reality.â
London Met was recognised by the TEF panel for the many examples submitted of excellence in a wide range of institutional contexts for its highly diverse mix of students, as well as for its clarity in identifying areas where improvements could be made.
The Education for Social Justice Framework development implemented by the university has been a key driver, alongside accountability from the Board of Governors, throughout the university.
The framework has been developed in line with the belief that the curricula and practice at London Met should align with principles of equity, with students, and the challenges facing London and its communities.
Julie Hall, Deputy Vice Chancellor, said: âThe social justice mission at London Met is shared by all âstudents, staff and academics alike.
This collective belief in the power and opportunity education brings underpins much of the strategy, which has been formed to ensure learning and teaching outcomes are of the highest standard.â
Tammika Chambers, Student Union VP of Education, commented: âThis success has come from the top down.
Everyone involved in evidencing the work for the TEF submission got stuck in and were very happy to get behind the work needed to actualise our vision.
Weâre making great progress, and we see where we need to focus our attention moving forward.â
London Met received an overall award of silver, student experience was awarded gold.
With the new corporate strategy launched in 2019, and a number of key underpinning strategies now being implemented, the university expects further improvements, particularly in the area of improving student outcomes, to filter through in all areas over the coming years.

London Metâs Head of Communications Ben Sawtell caught up with Professor Nona McDuff OBE, recently appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor for Student Experience at the University.
Date: 16 May 2023
âPioneeringâ, âdisruptorâ, and âinspiringâ, are just a few of the words that have been used to describe London Metâs new Pro Vice-Chancellor for Student Experience.
In a career spanning more than 30 years, Professor Nona McDuff has forged a reputation for transforming outcomes for Black, Asian and minoritised students, and has never been afraid of challenging the status quo.
Since receiving an OBE for her services to education in 2017, Nona has continued to innovate and transform the experience of students across the sector.
At an institutional level, she has left a powerful legacy at both Solent and Kingston universities, having transformed many aspects of the student experience leading to greatly improved continuation and completion rates and improved outcomes for students.
Nationally, Nona has been a prominent figure in the fight to drive reform.
She is a Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, a member of the Advance HE Peer-Review Quality Committee and of Universities UKâs Racial Harassment Advisory Group.
Nona arrived at London Met in April and has already started to build her vision for the year ahead.
What a great start it has been for me.
I was really fortunate to join London Met during the easter period so I was able to spend time getting to know the structures and the spaces and of course some of my colleagues.
I have been welcomed by everyone and it is clear that they all are delighted to be part of the London Met family and on this fabulous journey that the Vice-Chancellor is expertly leading.
I am excited to be part of this remarkable institution and work with our academics, professional services, and students to co-create and deliver the student success strategy.
It was of paramount importance to me.
It is a relief to join a university that has a genuine commitment to equity and social justice and has actually invested a notable proportion of its budget to delivering the ambitions on equity that it has set out so clearly.
All too often, university leaders speak of equity and diversity but they do not actually drive change in the way that the Vice-Chancellor and her senior leadership team at London Met are doing.
I am delighted to play my part in delivering a high quality and inclusive university and its fabulous that I am building on a strong foundation rather than starting from a low base.
Whilst there has been a lot of effort and energy by different groups and organisations, the data suggests that there needs to be a whole sector approach to understand the challenges and to with pace address the under-representation and differentials we are seeing still.
Simply put I was selling a product very few people wanted or knew that they wanted!
I think it is fair to say that at that time organisations did not routinely analyse the student journey by demographics so there was no knowledge of the differentials nor awareness.
When the Public Sector Equality Duty, Office for Fair Access and HEFCE (as they were known then) forced people to start to respond to questions about differentials and draw up plans and publish data did I and colleagues begin to see things change.
Even then it took pressure from the EDI community to force action through.
This business is for the those who are tenacious, brave and absolutely committed to transforming the lives of the broad range of students who enter higher education with dreams and ambitions to improve their life chances.
There are many of these fantastic people who have used data, told stories, presented images to show that without equity we cannot have a higher education system we are proud of.
Thank you and I have only been able to as you say transform the experience of students by bringing together students, academics and professional services staff to identify the issues and problem solve together.
Because the environment and studentâs needs and expectations are evolving, partnership working must be an ongoing process.
Change is never created by one person â it takes a village.
I am fortunate to have collaborated with talented people to create impactful change.
I am also honoured that my colleagues in the sector have drawn upon my work to create an inclusive curriculum, student services and environment.
Great progress has been made and we need to ensure we keep the momentum up.
A student is impacted by the culture of their institution, the sector, the employer and the Government.
Until there is recognition that universities which are serving students from disadvantaged or under-represented background require greater resources than those institutions with students from privileged backgrounds the biggest barriers will be policy, competing priorities and investment.
Over the next year, I will be working with colleagues to enhance student administration and services so students are better satisfied with their experience at London Met.
I will be also ensure that we have an institutional plan to increase the numbers of graduates who gain highly skilled employment whether that be in organisations or their own start-up businesses.
I would like to ensure that staff feel they are part of a journey of improvement and where their perspectives are valued and help shape the future of student services and administration at London Met.
I will also be working with the Deputy Vice-Chancellor to ensure that staff who are engaged in student improvement activities and can demonstrate positive impact are recognised through our promotion processes or applications for awards.
"I am excited to be part of this remarkable institution and work with our academics, professional services, and students to co-create and deliver the student success strategy."

We spoke to Adwoa Darko, London Met's Inclusive Communities Manager, about intersectionality, championing womenâs voices, and the work of our Centre for Equity and Inclusion.
Date: 8 March 2023
Not everyoneâs journey will be the same, some people face more obstacles and as such there cannot be a âone size fits allâ approach when we talk about gender.
Equality suggests that people should be given the same resources or opportunities.
Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and aims to address this systematically and allocate the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.
Equity is about readdressing past wrongs and recognising that there might be more work to do with certain groups to get us to a level playing field.
This is why we have works such as positive action programs that recognise the fact people begin their journeys at different starting blocks.
Within higher education this can mean working towards securing more representation for people from working class backgrounds, people of colour, and people who have traditionally not been able access to university education.
All sectors, spaces, and environments can only be improved by gender equality, and we need male advocacy and menâs voices for gender equality to achieve this goal.
It is important for men to recognise their societal power and privilege, and to use that power to create a more equitable society for all.
It is also necessary to recognise how the patriarchy harms men through the same functions that can benefit men.
So often we see that the role of advocacy is taken up by the marginalised, but this shouldnât be the case, the responsibility should be a shared commitment.
There is only so much women can do by themselves, it is time everybody starts singing from the same hymn sheet.
There is no one way to be a woman.
Womenâs experiences differ so radically depending on where they sit on the axis of different oppressions.
If we go by the âone size fits allâ approach to womanhood we ignore, and potentially harm those who donât fit within the traditional confines.
Intersectionality is important because we are recognising the ways in which power and oppression can combine to create different experience for women, for instance those in the black, trans, or disabled communities.
Their experiences matter as much as any other womanâs does.
It is part of London Metâs commitment to ensure that we have clear mechanisms, programs, and policies in place to address gender inequality in our workplace.
Our promise for gender equality goes beyond the charters though.
It is about the work we continue to do to make women, and especially women of colour, feel like that this workplace is for them and that we foster a sense of belonging.
Statistics still show that women still trail behind men across the HE sector, in almost all metrics.
Which again, is an opportunity to highlight the need for intersectionality.
Recent HESA data reflects that the number of black women professors has increased exponentially if expressed as a percentage, but the fact is the number is still shockingly low.
Almost count on your hands low.
And this is something that programs like Athena SWAN and 100 Black Women Professors Now aim to change.
This is one of the reasons I was so passionate about starting Brown Girl Brunch, because itâs a place for women of colour to come together and have a co-mentoring space to learn from one another, network and generally break bread.
The Brunch provides a chance to recognise similarities in our experiences, and support each other with the informal tools needed to navigate the workplace.

Date: 16 February 2023
London Met has climbed 53 places, to 162nd, in this yearâs Workplace Equality Index and has been awarded a Bronze award for its work to create a more inclusive workplace, UK-based LGBTQIA+ charity Stonewall announced today.
Stonewallâs Workplace Equality Index (WEI) is an annual audit that benchmarks and celebrates the efforts of leading organisations who are working to create more inclusive workplaces.
Announced alongside the WEI, London Metâs Bronze award demonstrates the progress the University has made against nine specific criteria such as putting in place explicit bans on discrimination, bullying and harassment based on gender identity and gender expression, sexual orientation.
The award recognises the hard work London Met has consistently carried out to be more inclusive, made evident by the fact London Met has climbed up 289 steps in the ranking since 2020.
News of London Metâs improved WEI standing was celebrated by the LGBTQIA+ Staff Network, who have played a key role in this success.
"This is a great result for the University, which shows the tangible progress London Met is making towards becoming a fully inclusive and welcoming place for LGBTQIA+ staff and students" commented Brian Tutt, Co-Lead of London Metâs LGBTQIA+ Staff Network and Co-Chair of the Stonewall Steering Group.
Nancy Kelley, CEO of Stonewall said: âCreating environments where we can all feel comfortable makes our workplaces a safer, better and friendlier place for everyone and helps staff be proud of who they are.â
âItâs been fantastic to see all of the work put in by London Met over the past year to create a workplace where LGBTQIA+ staff feel free to thrive as themselves.
For many of us, the majority of our time is spent at work, so if we have to hide who we are it can take an enormous personal toll and hold us back from fulfilling our true potential.â
Stonewall is the UKâs leading charity for lesbian, gay, bi and trans equality, working to create a world where every lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer person is free to be themselves â wherever they are.
â¯It was founded in 1989 by a small group of people who wanted to break down barriers to equality.
Stonewall continues to campaignâ¯on LGBT Equality,â¯as well asâ¯work with employersâ¯andâ¯schoolsâ¯to create environments which allow LGBTQ+ people to thrive.â¯

Guiding students towards their UK study goals can be a rewarding yet challenging task for international advisers.
With the diverse range of universities and courses available, understanding the unique aspects of UK higher education is crucial for providing effective counsel.
Here are some key points to consider and communicate to your students:
The UK comprises four distinct countries – England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland – each with its own education system nuances.
Scotland, for instance, typically offers four-year undergraduate courses that include a wider breadth of study in the initial years.
In contrast, England, Wales and Northern Ireland usually offer three-year undergraduate degrees with subject specialisation from day one.
Understand and meet the specific qualification requirements.
Each institution and course will have different requirements, with the UK often focusing on standardised tests and subject-specific prerequisites (especially within STEM).
Students need to review these as early as possible, as they may need to take additional classes and tests.
To aid in decision-making, the COLLEGE system offers a structured approach to evaluating universities and courses:
Course
Assess if the university offers the desired course and delve into modules and teaching styles.
Opportunities
Explore additional benefits like study abroad, work placements and scholarships.
Location
Consider the university's setting, be it urban or rural, and its impact on lifestyle.
League
Investigate university and course rankings in league tables for academic reputation and student satisfaction.
Entry Requirements
Review specific grade and qualification requirements for course entry.
Gut Feeling
Encourage visiting or virtually exploring campuses to gauge the right "fit".
Speak with current students via chat services and see student-produced social media content.
Education Style
Understand the balance between theoretical and practical learning approaches.
Utilising the COLLEGE framework, let's explore London Met as a holistic case study:
Presenting a balanced view, considering the academic and personal aspects of studying abroad, is beneficial when guiding students through their decision-making process.
By providing structured frameworks like COLLEGE and tangible examples like London Met, advisors can offer comprehensive support to students exploring their international education pathways.
Please find below a list of key terms around UK higher education.
We have also created a document with key terms you can download and save.
Buzzword
A unique word provided by a school (if they are registered as a UCAS centre) that acts as a key identifier, linking a student's undergraduate application with the school.
This allows them to track the application and upload references and relevant information.
Clearing
A UCAS process that allows students to find and apply for university courses that still have vacancies, typically after the main application period.
Whilst the date that UK universities open for Clearing varies, many will have it available on A-Level results day (typically the second Thursday in August).
While Clearing is open to all students, it particularly supports those who did not receive the grades they needed for their conditional offer or those who exceeded their conditions.
It varies as to whether universities allow international students to apply via Clearing due to the short time between Clearing opening and term starting, meaning visas can be difficult to acquire.
Conditional Offer
An offer of a place at a university that is dependent on the applicant meeting specific conditions, often related to exam results or other qualifications.
Firm Choice
In the UCAS application process, the firm choice is the student's preferred and first choice university.

Oxbridge
A colloquial term combining "Oxford" and "Cambridge," referring to the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the UK.
You can only apply to one of these universities per year on your UCAS application.
Personal Statement
A written document submitted with a university application (like a college application essay), in which the student details what course they want to study, why they want to study it and what makes them a good candidate for that course.
Tariff Points
A numerical system assigned to different qualifications and grades provides a standardised way for universities to assess and compare applicants' academic achievements.
Teacher Reference
A written recommendation provided by a teacher or advisor as part of the UCAS application.
Recent changes to the teachers' reference have created three separate sections covering general information about a school, extenuating circumstances and supportive information about the applicant that is relevant to the course.
UCAS
The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, a central application service for students applying to higher education institutions in the UK.
UCAS Centre
A UCAS centre is an educational institution or organisation registered with UCAS, allowing students to make their application through that institution.
It is free for a school to become a centre with more information provided on the UCAS website.
UCAS Extra
A UCAS service allowing students who have used all five choices and haven't received any offers to apply for additional courses one at a time.
UCAS Track
An online system that allows applicants to track the progress of their UCAS application, including offers, replies, and the status of chosen universities.

We've crafted this guide to provide students, educators, counsellors and stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the English education system.
This resource aims to shed light on the academic journey that domestic peers typically undertake before entering higher education.
It's important to note that while this guide offers a general overview, variations exist within the UK system, with differences present among individual institutions.
The English education system is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from foundational learning to specialised studies.
With a pronounced focus on cultivating critical thinking and subject expertise, particularly evident at Key Stage 5, students are well-prepared for the crucial stages of course selection and specialisation in higher education.
Unlike some systems, the English approach does not employ a GPA system; instead, it relies on standardised tests to assess students' academic progression.
The foundation years focus on holistic development, building fundamental literacy, numeracy, and social interaction skills.
One homeroom teacher typically teaches students all subjects.
Students are offered a broadening of subject choice, fostering curiosity and developing a well-rounded academic profile.
Multiple teachers with subject specialisms typically teach them.
Many universities will require students to have a grade of C/4+ in GCSE English and maths, with others requesting specific grades in other subjects as part of their admission offers.
A sixth form is typically attached to a high school where students can continue their studies.
Alternatively, students may choose to attend a college, which tends to be a larger institution with more vocational options available.
University admissions offers are typically based on students' Key Stage 5 qualifications.
Universities will either ask for a specific grade, e.g.
three A-Levels at BBB or Tariff points, e.g.
UCAS Tariff points 120.
UCAS Tariff points serve as a numerical representation of different qualifications and grades, converting them into a standardised value.
You can use the UCAS tariff calculator to review how much each qualification and grade is worth.
The English higher education system comprises universities and higher educational institutions.
Undergraduate (bachelor) courses are the student's first degree, and postgraduate (graduate) courses are completed after a student has graduated from their undergraduate degree.
Three-year programmes with no general education requirements.
Students select their course at the point of application, focusing and specialising within that one area for the entirety of their studies.
Some universities offer joint honours courses where students can combine two subjects (typically a 50/50 split).
The academic year typically runs from mid-September to mid-June, with long breaks for Christmas and Easter.
Most students will complete their degree at one institution, with transfers (whilst possible) being uncommon.
These courses are completed after students have completed their undergraduate programme.
There are a variety of postgraduate courses available.
Read our international FAQs for information on visas, funding, applying, studying and living in London.
UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) is the centralised service that students use to apply to undergraduate courses in the UK.
You can send a teacher's reference to London Met directly through the UCAS system when supporting a student's application.
You will need to be set up as a UCAS centre and ensure the student links their account to your institution via a buzzword.
Alternatively, if you are not a UCAS centre, the student will need to add your email address, and you will be contacted to provide a reference.
A UCAS reference should provide a detailed and supportive statement about the student's suitability for the chosen course of study.
UCAS has recently updated the format.
The reference is now divided into:
You can find examples and guides on the UCAS website .
International applicants wanting to study full-time can choose to apply via UCAS or directly to the University.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/about/corporate-governance/reportable-events:
The report of such events is a mandatory obligation.
A reportable event is defined within the OfS Regulatory Framework as:
any event or matter that, in the reasonable judgement of the OfS, negatively affects or could negatively affect:
a) The providerâs eligibility for registration with the OfS
b) The providerâs ability to comply with its conditions of registration
c) The providerâs eligibility for degree awarding powers, or its ability to comply with the criteria for degree awarding powers where the provider holds degree awarding powers
d) The providerâs eligibility for university title, where the provider holds university titleâ
In interpreting âthe reasonable judgement of the OfSâ, the OfS will, as a matter of policy, consider whether a reasonable provider intent on complying with all of its conditions of registration and acting in the interests of students and taxpayers (rather than in its own commercial, reputational or other interests), would consider the event or matter to be material.
The Office for Students has issued a guidance note covering reportable events .
There is a range of incidents that might comprise a reportable event .
Examples range from changes to the structure of the University as an organisation and a new Vice-Chancellor or Chair of the Board of Governors, to investigation by an accrediting or other regulatory body or a report of serious fraud.
While the OfS provides guidance, a range of factors will need to be considered in deciding whether an incident is reportable.
As part of this obligation the University is also required to keep a note of our decision-making.
The likelihood of the need to report such incidents is expected to be low.
It is important any event that might be considered a reportable event is properly considered by the University prior to any report to the OfS.
We rely on our staff, students and stakeholders to bring any potential reportable events to our attention.
If you become aware of an event or activity that might be considered a reportable event, and would like to discuss this further, please contact Nicola Le Faou, University Secretary, send details by email to n.lefaou@londonmet.ac.uk or complete the form below.
Please note we will use our usual policies and procedures to investigate a potential reportable event as part of its consideration.

Date: 21 October 2022
London Met students are set to plant 420 trees for the important tasks of providing food and shelter for wildlife, addressing carbon emissions, air quality and biodiversity loss.
The School of Art, Architecture and Design at London Met will undertake the project at Mudchute City Farm, using saplings acquired as part of the Woodland Trustâs Free Trees for Schools and Communities scheme.
All students from the School of Art, Architecture and Design and Empowering London are welcome to join the planting event, which will take place on 30 November 2022, with first-year students particularly encouraged.
As SiÃ¢n Moxon, senior lecturer in Architecture, says, âWe want every student to plant a tree during their studies, as part of acknowledging and taking responsibility for their own ecological footprint, before learning to influence othersâ lifestyles through sustainable practice.â
The project will create 100 metres of hedge with a mixture of tree species including hawthorn, rowan, blackthorn, silver birch, hazel and common oak.
Each tree could offset one tonne of carbon over its lifetime.
This comes as part of the Universityâs commitment to addressing the environmental challenges facing the capital city through the London Met Lab, as well as the work of the School to ârewildâ urban areas through its Cities research group.
The School has a proud history of delivering proactive environmental initiatives, such as the announcement of Architecture Education Declares (AED) in 2019, which its students helped to launch.
The Art, Architecture and Design Education Declares manifesto builds environmentalism into the Schoolâs education practice, stating that solutions to the ecological crisis we face are rooted in good architecture and design.
The tree-planting event builds on the Universityâs ongoing relationship with Mudchute City Farm, where the School holds an annual technology workshop for its Architecture students.

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/double-win-for-london-met-in-design-research-funding:
Two research teams at London Metropolitan University have secured major funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, winning two of just five available Design Exchange Partnership (DEP) grants.
The projects, Wild Ways and Neighbourhood Textile Commons , form part of the broader Archway Cultural Commons research programme.
The grants will support London Met researchers to work with alumni and non-academic partners for one year from early 2025.
Both projects explore ' more-than-human design ', an approach that takes into account the needs of other species and the environment as well as people.
Wild Ways focuses on encouraging rewilding in private residential gardens in London to support urban biodiversity.
Based at the Centre for Urban and Built Ecologies (CUBE), the study is co-led by Associate Professor of Sustainable Architecture SiÃ¢n Moxon and Associate Professor of Public Health Dr Justin Webb .
It builds on the Rewild My Street campaign and brings together design and behavioural science to test a strategy that helps residents make simple changes to create wildlife-friendly spaces.
The work is supported by a partnership with the Kusuma Trust.
Neighbourhood Textile Commons , based at the Centre for Applied Research for Empowering Society (CARES), is led by Dr Torange Khonsari and Alice Holloway , and co-led by Dr Stephen Hills .
It explores how communities can produce textiles sustainably while restoring local habitats and changing behaviour around land use.
The team is working with the London Borough of Islington and the Maya Centre to develop a regenerative textile commons in Archway.
Key initiatives include angora rabbit grazing to improve soil health, reed beds to filter natural dyes, sustainable craft methods, and exploring how green jobs can emerge from new supply chains linked to public spaces.
The DEP programme is part of the Design Museumâs Future Observatory initiative and supports research that benefits local communities and helps the UK respond to environmental challenges.
These projects also connect with London Metâs London Met Lab: Environment initiative , which brings together academics and local partners to create practical solutions to city-wide issues.
Both projects address this yearâs DEP theme of more-than-human design by focusing on the shared needs of people, nature and places.
Wild Ways will test its approach through Rewild My Street , helping residents turn their homes, gardens and streets into wildlife habitats.
Neighbourhood Textile Commons brings together fashion, textile and urban design to imagine new ways of using land in cities and to track citizen behaviour change.
Both initiatives reflect the values set out in the universityâs Art, Architecture and Design Education Declares statement , which commits to responding to the climate and ecological emergency through education and design.
How this helps people and society
These projects aim to deliver direct benefits to communities.
Wild Ways gives residents the tools and knowledge to support biodiversity from their own gardens.
Greener spaces can improve mental health, reduce local temperatures and support pollinators, birds and other wildlife.
Neighbourhood Textile Commons focuses on building local circular economies that reduce waste, improve wellbeing through shared creative work, and open up opportunities for meaningful green employment.
Reflecting on the award, SiÃ¢n Moxon said:
âWeâre looking forward to building on our findings and widening the scope of Wild Ways with this valued support.
We hope the outcomes will inspire rewilding in London and similar design-led work in other cities.
Itâs also exciting to explore the crossovers between our two London Met projects.â
In a statement linked to the wider Creative Archway initiative, the London Borough of Islington said:
âOur institutional relationship is built on a shared ambition for equality and justice.
We are fortunate to have London Met as a passionate and professional borough advocate.
Through the AHRC DEP, we continue our broader collaboration.â
Sophie Cloutterbuck, Director of London Engagement and London Met Lab, added:
âThese grants show the power and purpose of London Metâs research.
They are rooted in collaboration, focused on major challenges facing the city, and they create real opportunities for students.
This is a clear example of our civic mission in action.â

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/peregrine-falcons-return-to-london-mets-tower-building:
Date: 3 March 2025
A Peregrine Falcon was spotted on London Metropolitan Universityâs Falcon Cam earlier this week, raising hopes that our regular visitors will once again be nesting at the top of the universityâs iconic Tower Building.
London Met has been home to a pair of peregrine falcons since 2018, with the birds returning each year to breed.
They are drawn to the Tower Buildingâs high vantage point and sheltered nesting spots, which provide safety from predators and a stable environment.
The falcons have only just arrived, so itâs too early to expect to see chicks.
But you can keep an eye on our Falcon Cam to track their progress and look out for any new arrivals.
Taking Conservation Seriously
London Met works closely with the London Peregrine Partnership (LPP) to ensure the birds are safe and undisturbed.
In line with conservation efforts, planned maintenance on the Tower will be postponed to avoid disrupting the falcons during their nesting period.
âThese birds are an important part of Londonâs wildlife, and weâre so proud to provide a safe space for them to thrive,â said Ailsa Shaylor, London Metâs Sustainability Manager.
âOur commitment to urban biodiversity is evident through initiatives like installing beehives on campus rooftops and working towards Carbon Net Zero.
By fostering these projects, we aim to optimise our environment for various species, including our cherished peregrine falcons.â
Speaking to the Islington Tribune , Stuart Harrington, co-founder of the London Peregrine Partnership, emphasised the significance of urban nesting sites for these birds: âTall, isolated buildings like the one at London Met make a great substitute for the cliff faces peregrines use in the wild.
However, not many buildings have the right conditions for nesting, so itâs fantastic to see them return year after year.â
Reflecting on the birds' history at London Met, Harrington added, âA two-year-old female that hatched in a nest near the Thames took over the site in 2018.
That pair bred successfully each year until 2024, when a new female took over the territory.
Last year, she and the resident male raised two young that fledged in July.
It will be interesting to see if this pair returns again this year.â
Peregrines are highly territorial and often return to successful nesting sites.
âOnce they find a secure and productive site, they will usually stay as long as conditions remain stable,â Harrington explained.
âLondon Metâs Tower Building has proven to be one of these rare, ideal locations for peregrine falcons.â
The Fastest Bird in the World
Falcons are fast, agile birds of prey with sharp vision and pointed wings.
The peregrine falcon holds the title of the fastest animal on the planet, reaching speeds of over 390 km/h (242 mph) in a dive.
They thrive in various habitats and are known for their impressive hunting skills.
The most recent records show that there are around 40 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons in the capital.
London Metâs Tower Building joins other famous peregrine nesting sites across the city, including The Tate Modern, Battersea Power Station, and The Houses of Parliament.
âItâs a privilege to now be able to see them in busy urban areas like Holloway Road,â Harrington said.
âFifty years ago, peregrines were a rare sight in the UK due to the use of pesticides, but their populations have bounced back and theyâve successfully adapted to city life.â

Can we save the planet?
Can we make London a cleaner, more environmentally friendly place to live?
This was the main discussion at the Dirty London panel on Wednesday evening, part of London Met's Journalism Newsweek debate, where invited guests discuss a topic of interest to students.
Journalism Senior Lecturer, Daniel Schweimler, headed the discussion with contributions and questions from the audience members, which consisted of students, staff and guests.
Journalism students covered the event by producing TV programmes, podcasts and articles, which "gives them a real taste of real journalism", said Course Leader Wendy Sloane.
Another Newsweek on "Dirty Fashion" will take place in March.
Among the panellists yesterday were Dr Patrick Hart, a member of Just Stop Oil; Marijn van de Geer, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion; Kwajo Tweneboa, a social activist focused on social housing; Sean Maguire, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications at the Clean Air Fund; Caroline "Caz" Royds, a member of the Islington Environmental Alliance; and Giulia Innocenti, a representative of the Green Our Neighbourhood group and a councillor for the borough of Barnet.
The main focus of the discussion was the current environmental crisis on a local and global level.
Air pollution, social housing, people's behaviour and media exposure are just a few of the issues debated that contribute to the detriment of the environment and peopleâs health.
Suggestions were made on how citizens can improve their local environment, while the panellists maintained there is still time to turn things around.
They urged the audience to get involved through different means, such as peaceful and non-violent protesting.
Van de Geer expressed the significance of getting involved.
She said: âI think itâs our absolute duty to protest...
Let your voice be heard.
Itâs absolutely vital.
Itâs our democratic right.â
The speakers expressed their passion for their work for improving the local environment and the future opportunities for residents to take part in council initiatives.
Innocenti emphasises on the need for people to get involved on a local level and have their suggestions and ideas heard.
"If you want to try doing something, do it locally and youâll have a lot more sway.â
Despite how apocalyptic the circumstances might look, the panellists were heartened to know that the future generations are galvanised in taking the necessary steps to improve the global climate crisis.
The actions of individuals, when combined, can contribute towards a positive outcome.
Tweneboa was perhaps the most impactful - and the youngest - speaker, working as a social housing activist exposing slum landlords throughout the UK.
His work has been recognised throughout the UK, which in turn, led to his nomination for an MBE - which he turned down.
He told the audience that he started campaigning because he was one of those people living in slum conditions.
He said he would not be accepting an award or a title when people continue to live that way, and even die in those poor living environments âThereâs no way I could take an award and be celebratedâ¦ for fighting for something that is a basic human right.â

New sentences found on https://londonmet.ac.uk/news/articles/recycling-myths-busted:
Date: 22 October 2023
Itâs no secret that we need to be recycling more.
Weâre always encouraged to recycle as much as possible, but what we might not consider is that throwing things into the wrong bin can cause contamination, undoing all of our good intentions.
To bring these issues forward following National Recycling Week, we sat down with Jessica Bellehewe, Sustainability Manager at London Met, to help us with some myth busting.
To kick things off, Jessica â tell us about your background in sustainability and what your priorities are for London Met in the coming months
I started off my career at a waste recycling company, which involved dealing with all sorts of waste within shopping centres and hospitals mostly.
Which as you can imagine, is a lot!
And not unlike the sort of space we operate in here at London Met.
My experience covers managing environmental systems, energy systems, reducing energy consumption and cO2 emissions, and then some fun initiatives focusing on rewilding and green events.
Iâve been consulting for a few years, which has meant Iâve been focused on supporting organisations with their environmental impact management and improving ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) credentials.
My target for London met is to increase our levels of recycling to 75%.
With welcome weeks and onsite catering of takeaway dishes, itâs been challenging to increase the volume of materials weâre recycling.
Myth: Recycling schemes are expensive for organisations
Not true.
There are higher charges for disposing landfill due to the taxes associated with the process.
This is to encourage the use of recycling, which is more cost-effective for organisations.
Not only does it benefit our overall sustainability drive, but it also benefits the bottom line.
The money saved on waste disposal can then be invested elsewhere â but itâs also just doing the right thing as well.
A win-win, in other words.
Itâs also cheaper and more sustainable to recycle and re-use materials across campus than sourcing raw materials to make products with.
Myth: Mixing in food or other items in the recycling isnât a big deal
It is.
Throwing away food into a recycling bin, for example, can mean that otherwise recyclable waste is now completely contaminated.
Even if the food doesnât touch all the recyclable items in the bin, this wouldnât be fit for processing.
That means, in turn, that the whole bin needs to be treated as general waste, and the potential for materials to be used again has then been lost.
Most people arenât aware that a small action like this can have big consequences â and such negative ones, too.
Myth: How you approach recycling at home has nothing to do with your place of work or study
There are different rules for the different areas we operate in â however, the habits you form at home can influence your behaviour in a public setting.
Donât underestimate how your actions can feed into the bigger picture.
If we train ourselves at home to approach recycling in the right way, weâre more likely to take these good practices into the wider world, which can make a bigger difference than you might think.
Myth: More is more â most things can be recycled nowadays
Not true, sadly.
Many people can fall into the trap of âwish-cyclingâ â a positive outlook towards all materials being fit for the recycling bin.
But assuming things can be recycled without properly checking the labels, and then throwing them in the recycling bin can cause long term damage to the machines that process plastics, cardboard and recycling material.
I consistently emphasise that taking a few seconds to inspect packaging for recyclability is crucial.
Itâs unfortunate when non-recyclable items mistakenly end up in the wrong bin, leading to materials melting or becoming stuck in the machinery of waste processing centres.
Such incidents can result in the entire processing plant shutting down and causing operational delays.
Myth: All plastic can be recycled together, it doesnât matter what sort it is
False.
The different labelling corresponds to the type of plastic that is used, and then the way in which it needs to be recycled.
Really soft plastics like some drinks bottles have to be handled separately to hard plastics such as hangars.
This is why the usual plastic bags canât be recycled at home usually, and supermarkets offer a collection point to accept soft plastics.
Always search online if unsure of which category the plastic falls into.

The initiative also serves to highlight a return to nature and craft, and the power and desirability of local materials and strengthened communities.
Callum Pincombe will be showcasing his remarkable 'slice table', which has a top made of slices of timber from a single log.
Founder and curator of Green Grads, Barbara Chandler, said "Our show is an inarguable double whammy: we deliver support for new designers and support for the environment at one and the same timeâ¦through engaging content created and exhibited by the cream of recent graduates from British universities."
She adds: "We are not saying that all the projects and ideas we show will be commercially viable, or indeed possible right now in the 'real world' but they are seeds to nurture and grow, the results of in-depth research and dedicated hours in studios and workshops.
Their inventors are the talent we so sorely need to help solve our eco-crises."
This is the second edition of Green Grads at Planted at Samsung which last year attracted around 2,000 visitors over a single weekend.
Green Grads 2022 will introduce around 50 new graduates from Universities and Colleges all over the UK.
They have been carefully chosen by Barbara Chandler, who's explored degree shows from Falmouth to Manchester, then criss-crossed London, and practically pitched tent at the two editions of the New Designers shows this summer.

London Metâs Sian Moxon is set to join Planted, the first contemporary design event and media platform promoting exclusively environmentally focused businesses, as part of its Planted Unearthed talks programme.
She will take part in the Wasted Spaces panel, hosted by Planted âs biophilic design advisor Oliver Heath, which will explore how vast swathes of our towns, cities and buildings could be handed back to nature but lack of thought, education and will on the part of authorities.
Looking at the benefits of infusing our urban spaces with nature, the expert panel will consider the big wins when it comes to rewilding and regenerating them; the role that green roofs, green walls and nature corridors play; and how can we convince all local authorities and gardeners to stop needlessly strimming, concreting over and destroying natural habitats.
The three-day talks programme takes place as part of Kingâs Cross Design District.
It will led by Planted âs biophilic design advisor Oliver Heath and co-founder Sam Peters, will explore themes around designing buildings and urban spaces for nature, sustainable food systems and unnatural waste associated with packaging, agricultural production and energy consumption.
Confirmed speakers across the three-days include: Dr Gemma Jerome (Building with Nature), Zac Goodall (Riverford Organic Farmers), Sam Boex (Flexi-Hex), Marie Carlisle (Goldfinger) Tommie Eaton (Bambuubrush), Agamemnon Otero MBE (Energy Garden) and Johnny Palmer (Solcell).
The talks will be staged on Planted âs stunning off-grid mobile cabin in a prime location on Granary Square, Kingâs Cross with beautifully crafted seating provided by B-Corp certified Danish brand Skagerak.

SiÃ¢n Moxonâs rewilding project receives coverage in the esteemed magazine, Time Out London.
Date: 2 August 2022
SiÃ¢n Moxon , a Senior Lecturer and Sustainability Coordinator in London Met's School of Art, Architecture and Design, is an expert in sustainable design and is leading the School's response to the climate and ecological emergency through Architecture Education Declares .
SiÃ¢nâs research project, Rewild My Street (RMS) , uses architectural drawings to inspire and empower residents to transform Londonâs streets for wildlife.
The drawings are part of a design toolkit which provides recommendations for products and activities to attract wildlife , and brings together expert information on urban species and habitats.
In the Time Out feature, SiÃ¢n emphasises that even if you havenât got a garden, you can still have an important ecological impact.
âHaving a garden in London can be a luxury and a rarity, especially if youâre living closer to zone one.
But even if you live in a tower block, you can still plant a window box which will be great for pollinators, such as bees,â she comments.
SiÃ¢n also told the magazine how sheâs used her own advice in her own garden, which has been 'transformed her own small north London garden into an oasis for frogs, foxes and hedgehogs, with piles of logs, multiple bird boxes and a pond.
Her fences are covered by climbing plants and they incorporate gaps to allow wildlife to easily come and go'.
The importance of rewilding was highlighted at this yearâs RHS Chelsea Flower Show, with the winner imagining 'a beaversâ dam on a brook with near-pinpoint ecological accuracy'.
Rewilding London is an ongoing project, which requires community led programmes.
âThe idea is if lots of people do this, there will be more corridors for wildlife to travel along.
Parks and gardens in the built-up areas of London work as âstepping stonesâ connecting to larger wildlife areas in the outskirts.
Then, to be really effective, London councils will have to team up with neighbouring local authorities to try and encourage cross-boundary nature corridors.
The eventual result?
Free-roaming wildlife throughout all of London and the UKâ.

SiÃ¢n Moxonâs Rewild My Street campaign profiled in prestigious design magazine.
Date: 22 July 2022
SiÃ¢n Moxon , who teaches across the Architecture and Interior Design courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, explored environmental design and her conservation initiative âRewild My Streetâ in the July issue of Designer Magazine.
SiÃ¢n is an expert in sustainable design and is leading the School's response to the climate and ecological emergency through Architecture Education Declares.
Her Rewild My Street research project uses architectural drawings to inspire and empower residents to transform Londonâs streets for wildlife.
The drawings are shared in the rewildmystreet.org website, which forms a design toolkit, recommending products and activities to attract wildlife, and curating expert information on urban species and habitats.
In the piece for Designer Magazine, SiÃ¢n commented on the importance environmental concerns have within the design process.
âDesigners are duty bound to address both the biodiversity and climate crises, given industry initiatives such as Architectsâ Climate Action Network, Interior Design Declares and Landscape Architects Declare.
Besides, greening cities has wider environmental benefits, contributing to better air quality, amenity value, and climate change resilience against flood risk and overheating.â
SiÃ¢n detailed key advice for designers trying to incorporate more rewilding and environmentally beneficial aspects to their design process.
âThe first step is to see every component of a home as a potential site for wildlife.
Most obvious are the outdoor spaces, where even small areas count: a front or back garden, balcony, terrace or side return can accommodate many wildlife features.â
âAim to include a pond and a tree, which make the most impact for wildlife and be in containers to save space, alongside mini meadows, log piles and bespoke homes for frogs and hedgehogsâ also âbuildingâs walls can host green walls and integrated habitat boxes for different bird species, bats, and solitary bees.â
The senior lecturer also detailed what designers should avoid doing.
âAvoid artificial grass, an environmental no-no that excludes wildlife, exacerbates flooding, contributes to pollution and climate change, and is ultimately destined for landfillâ and âLimit outdoor lighting, ensuring it is dim and downward-facing where essential, to avoid disturbing bats and other nocturnal animals.â
Looking to the future, SiÃ¢n can see these methods and examples having a huge impact across London, and the country.
âThese domestic rewilding principles can be applied at city scale to any building type or external space.
With this mindset, whole cities can be reimagined as green networks of âpocket parks', âtiny forestsâ, and âplay streets', surrounded by âwild beltsâ and connected by âslow waysâ.
With many cities following London in becoming National Park Cities and committing to become greener, healthier, and wilder, savvy designers can make their mark in helping shape how this is realised.â

Courses at London Metropolitan University are designed to be flexible, allowing students to tailor their course to suit their needs and interests.
The majority of degree courses allow students to study single honours (one subject) or joint honours (two subjects).
However, students on a joint honours programme can transfer to study only one of their subjects on a single honours programme at the end of the first year.
The modular approach also means that aside from the number of core modules that students are required to complete, depending on the subject area there is also a wide choice of optional modules, some of which can be taken from different subject areas and departments.
Some students are much better at individual study whilst others prefer more guidance and contact hours.
Study at university is much more independent than at school or college.
Students are expected to be self-motivated and able to complete much of their study independently.

Parkour, which was officially recognised as a sport in the UK in 2017, is a passion for London Met graduate James Adams , who recently started his own Parkour Clinic.
Having completed both his Sports Therapy BSc and Sport and Exercise Science MRes at the Uni, James also won the best student poster award at the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES) 2021 conference â BASES are the professional body for the industry.
We talk to James to find out more.
I was just looking for something that would keep me fit and healthy as I was getting bored with the gym!
Iâd never really gotten on with a lot of the traditional sports and physical disciplines, mostly because Iâve never really been all that interested in competition, and so when I saw an article about Parkour classes in a newspaper it caught my attention.
It was fun, it was different, it was challenging in the ways I needed at that time in my life, and most importantly, it was very social, with a great community of practitioners to get involved with.
After a while I realised it had slowly become something that had enabled me to grow and change as a person, and I wanted to help others experience that in any capacity, so I made the decision to jump ship on my 9-to-5 and pursue coaching as a career, which later led me to university as a mature student.
Yes!
In fact, that very point became one of the central questions of my master's research â how do you describe, measure and study a decentralised sport?
Especially one that has very few (if any) objective measures, but is instead driven a great deal by the subjective and personal goals and challenges of the individual taking part?
I canât pretend that I have anything close to an answer, but I think just considering that question before undertaking any studies of Parkour is something that researchers should really strive to do.
The greatest thing I learnt from coaching is that the individual is the key.
If you are coaching a group of people, and you canât adapt your group plan to the needs of an individual within that group to make sure they remain challenged yet safe, tackling their own approaches to the obstacle while still feeling part of the greater whole, then you have failed that person.
Iâve carried this forward now into both my therapy and teaching work â you can use all the data and general understanding of populations to inform your thinking, but at the end of the day, the individual is the key.
Yes, working with the London Met Clinic was one of the highlights of my work experience during the therapy course!
While my other work placements gave me great opportunities for learning, the clinic gave me the best understanding of the importance of sitting down and really listening, one to one, to a patient.
It sounds strange to say, but a highlight that really sticks with me is actually the first time I felt like I didnât do a good enough job with a patient, that Iâd let them down in some way (I mean, I was still learning!) What surprised me was the degree to which I felt that disappointment and how much I clearly cared about the help I deliver to patients under my care, and how it motivated me to improve my abilities as a therapist.
My project looked at the ground reaction forces â basically how hard the ground hits you back when you hit it â that occur when landing from a few common Parkour movements.
What excited me most about the project as I did my preliminary research into existing Parkour studies was a feeling of this being new â as far as Iâm aware, no study before had looked at the movements I was looking at, and I think only one other has in the time since!
That feeling of discovery and that I was adding something to the wider knowledge of the sport was incredibly rewarding.
Iâm just grateful to get a chance to share my little contribution, and hopefully it will give someone a springboard to their own study and new piece of information down the road in turn!
The people, both staff and students, that I met.
In particular, and Iâm probably going to make him squirm saying this, but Iâm very grateful to Karl Grainger, who supervised me across both my undergraduate and master's research projects.
His enthusiasm for and dedication to teaching is one of the main reasons I committed to the master's at London Met.
I donât know if "favourite" is the right word, but the piece of tech I became most familiar with was the force platform â the thing that measures those ground reaction forces I mentioned earlier.
What I did grow to love about it is that it just spits out a whole load of numbers, and itâs then up to you what you do with those numbers.
Iâm a bit of a data science nerd at heart, so finding a way to just take this huge ream of nonsensical data and shape it into something that conveys some kind of meaning was very rewarding.
Although it did also show me that you can make stats say whatever you want if youâre determined to be sneaky and underhanded, so Iâm much more sceptical of numbers and data from other sources these days until I check them myself!
Yes, I went to university for the first time at 30 and graduated at 34.
I actually found the experience very beneficial, as I doubt I would have found myself studying the course I did if I had gone at 18.
I also found my ability to handle a lot of the common stresses of university life â deadlines, exams, early mornings â was much improved.
I think my only concern was that I would be the old man of the class, but I was lucky that there were other mature students in my group, and even in the wider group no real age divide ever came up anyway.
To anyone considering going to university as a mature student , I highly recommend it!
Opportunity.
The Parkour Clinic Iâm currently running is a free, online-only project I started to give something back to the parkour community after it gave me so much.
I really recommend finding a community-focused project to anyone out there â you donât have to give it much of your time to make it hugely rewarding.
Beyond that, Iâm hoping to be able to continue my parkour research â the sport is in so many ways still in its infancy, and for all that organic growth is an important element of its development, there are things we can still check out and improve, mainly around injury prevention and best coaching practises.
Plus, we can âproveâ things in studies and then point to them with the wider world and say, âLook!
See!
We told you this thing was awesome!
You should try it!â
Donât forget the âscienceâ part!
"Iâm a bit of a data science nerd at heart, so finding a way to just take this huge ream of nonsensical data and shape it into something that conveys some kind of meaning was very rewarding."

The University has helped me a lot with finding my own pace in the city.
I love the Barbican.

Providing a space where people can go to study or sit and have lunch; it's just those little things that help with that inclusivity of spaces.
I used to go to this little CD store in my hometown and I would just pick out a CD based on the cover.
I always found myself listening to albums while I was either painting or drawing.

And I think it's important that architects do everything that they can to make that experience better for people.

I started living with my grandma shortly before my first birthday when my parents travelled to Italy in search of a better life for all of us.
As I was so young, I didnât really notice or feel the absence of my parents.
Living with my grandmother was one of the best things that ever happened to me.
It gave me the opportunity to learn so many cultural elements of my country â Ghana.
One of my favourite activities I loved doing with my grandma was food shopping and cooking.
She would allow me to follow her to the market and I observed how to negotiate with market sellers for the best ingredients at the best price.
At home, she allowed me to get involved in the preparation and cooking, which of course as a little girl I loved.
One of the most popular dishes my grandma loved making was shito, a traditional Ghanaian hot pepper sauce.

Upon arriving, I realised that I could not get shito sauce that tasted like my grandmaâs, and this really frustrated me, as I loved it.
I decided to make my own shito using the techniques Iâd learnt from my grandmother.

So although it was not my passion to have worked in retail, I am thankful for the life lessons it gave me.
After all those years, I still had the urge to follow in my dreams to achieve in life what I really wanted to do â to work in forensics.
I chose to study at London Met not only because of the great facilities the University has to offer, especially when considering a scientific-based course â the huge laboratory and all the equipment available therein is fantastic, but I also chose to study here due to the range of students that attend, many different age ranges and ethnicities, making the decision to go back into a learning environment as a mature student a lot less daunting.

My role as a Digital Forensic Assistant with the London Metropolitan Police can be quite varied but at the same time not â the main bulk of my job role is to examine digital devices, mainly mobile phones and tablets, in the most forensically sound way as to help with the investigation of the case they are an exhibit of.
Speaking to and advising police officers is also a big part of my role.
As a police officer is the first person to have gathered the exhibit, they need to know not only on how to proceed with any digital devices, but also what intel might be gathered â and if this will be helpful to a case.
Working for the London Metropolitan Police is different to what I had been expecting, I think part of me was expecting a very strict and rigid working environment and it is far from it.
The whole working environment is relaxed, not to a point where you can slack off, but in a way where you can really enjoy your work.
I have not been working there long, but I feel like I have been a part of the team for a very long time.
There are many protocols to be followed due to the importance of the exhibits in helping in the outcome of a case, and although only a small portion of my course was relevant to the field of forensics I have gone into, the ones that were relevant have prepared me very well.

My favourite space would have to be the courtyards, especially the one with the pond.
I spent many an hour here studying and getting projects done with friends.

My biggest passion was probably the one I have now achieved by studying at London Met â to work in a forensic field, and to be able to contribute in my small way in the outcome of crime.
My other passion is to be the best version of myself I can be.
Iâd say I got this passion mostly from my dad â he and I are very close, and he has always encouraged and supported me.
Might be a bit of a clichÃ© to say but I would say I, myself am what drives me.
Setting myself targets and goals and wanting to not only achieve them but to surpass them if I can.
I not only want to make my family and friends proud of me, but I want to be proud of myself and have no regrets.
I cannot say I just have one proudest moment; I would say it was a combination of getting accepted into London Met to study the course I had wanted to do for so long, then when I graduated, and again when I found out I got the job I worked so hard for.
Travelling is a big passion of mine, I enjoy the diversity of different cultures, and being able to just explore new places and see new things, which goes hand in hand nicely with my other passion; I am also a keen amateur photographer.
Although this is not a professional skill, it is something I enjoy immensely and both together really help me to unwind, take some me time, and enjoy the beauty of what this world has to offer.
My biggest piece of advice to anyone who is not sure, not only about studying at London Met but going into further education itself, is do it.
There is no better time than the present.
There is not only the opportunity to learn and discover new topics in class but the diversity and opportunities that London Met offers will also help open up a whole new world of discovering yourself and others.
