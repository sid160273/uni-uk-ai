New sentences found on https://bbk.ac.uk/news/birkbecks-institute-for-crime-justice-policy-research-partner-with-currys-to-tackle-phone-theft-in-london:
13 August 2025
A new campaign, ‘ Mind the Grab ’ aimed at curbing phone theft in central London has launched on Oxford Street, with researchers from Birkbeck’s Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research (ICPR) leading the evaluation of its impact.
The initiative has been commissioned by Currys in collaboration with Westminster Council, the Metropolitan Police Service, and Crimestoppers.
It features a striking purple line painted along the pavement outside Currys’ flagship store on Oxford Street, designed to prompt pedestrians to step back from the kerb and keep their phones out of sight.
The idea is these simple actions could reduce the risk of snatch-and-grab thefts, which are increasingly carried out by criminals on mopeds or e-bikes.
The campaign draws inspiration from the familiar “Mind the Gap” warning used across the London Underground, repurposing it as a visual cue to raise awareness about phone theft hotspots.
According to Freedom of Information data, over 34,000 phones were stolen in Westminster last year, equating to one every 15 minutes.
ICRP researchers, Professor Mai Sato, Dr Bina Bhardwa and PHD student Lochlan Plane, will conduct an independent study to track how the purple line affects people’s behaviour and whether it contributes to a drop in phone theft in the area.
Results will be published in late 2025, when Currys will call on other councils to adopt the intervention - and explore expansion to other UK cities.
Mai Sato, Professor and Director of the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research says: “The research team at Birkbeck are very excited to be involved in this pilot and to observe how the use of a simple nudge technique - a vibrant purple line on the pavement – coupled with a play on a well-known phrase to all London Underground commuters - ‘Mind the Gap’ - can influence behavioural change in pedestrians in phone snatching hot-spots”.
The campaign has received strong backing from Westminster Council and the Metropolitan Police, who have increased patrols in hotspot areas.
Superintendent Natasha Evans, the Met’s local policing lead for Westminster, noted a 20% drop in robbery rates in the West End since April, attributing the decline in part to targeted initiatives like this one.

New sentences found on https://bbk.ac.uk/about-us/history:
Birkbeck has been helping people access higher education and transform their lives for 200 years.
We have an illustrious, unconventional and radical history of which we are very proud.
Birkbeck was founded on the evening of 11 November 1823, when around 2000 people flocked to the Crown and Anchor Tavern on the Strand to hear Dr George Birkbeck speak on the importance of educating the working people of London.
Supporters present at the event including Jeremy Bentham, the philosopher and originator of Utilitarianism, Sir John Hobhouse, a Radical MP who held several important government posts across his career, and Henry Brougham, a liberal MP, anti-slavery campaigner and tireless educational reformer.
Following this initial meeting, the London Mechanics’ Institute was formally created at the same location on 2 December 1823, with the stated aim of educating working people.
This foundation meant that, for the first time, artisans and craftspeople could learn about science, art and economics: a concept so controversial that George Birkbeck was accused of 'scattering the seeds of evil'.
Undeterred, George Birkbeck called his supporters to action: 'Now is the time for the universal benefits of the blessings of knowledge.' Many donors were convinced by the important mission and enough money was raised to open the Institution and pursue a radical new vision.
Seven years later, in 1830, the Institute took a further radical step by becoming one of the first colleges to admit women as students - nearly 40 years before the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
In 1858, the ratification of the University of London’s Charter meant that any student could sit degree examinations.
Birkbeck fast became the best choice for students who wanted a university education but could not afford to study full-time.
This role was formalised in 1920 when Birkbeck officially became part of the University of London, on the understanding that it would continue to offer evening study.

When: 17 September 2025, 18:00 — 20:00 Venue: Senate House
A joint event by the Institute for Crime and Justice Policy Research (ICPR), Birkbeck and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies , School of Advanced Study , University of London.
Why do many Filipinos continue to support former President Rodrigo Duterte's violent policies despite widespread international condemnation?
This interdisciplinary event examines this compelling question whilst exploring the implications for Duterte's  case at the International Criminal Court.
Drawing on original quantitative research, the speakers will present findings revealing five distinct attitudinal groups among Filipino citizens, with particular focus on the 'extremely punitive' group characterised by preference for authoritarian leadership and low institutional trust.
The presentation will demonstrate how authoritarian values and perceived social threats create conditions where ordinary citizens actively support state violence against marginalised communities.
The event will also explore innovative research using sensorial criminology, based on fieldwork in Mindanao, which reveals how everyday sensory experiences construct a 'sensorial regime' that normalises extrajudicial killings.
This groundbreaking approach illuminates how authoritarian power operates through subtle sensory registers to generate grassroots endorsement of violence.
Finally, speakers will examine the contemporary legal and political implications of Duterte's ICC case, analysing civil society's role, government positioning, and how the 2025 midterm elections may impact future accountability for mass violence in the Philippines.

24 July 2025
Birkbeck recently held its inaugural AI Summit, attended by colleagues from across the University, members of its alumni, plus external stakeholders; and is taking steps to develop a policy framework to formalize how and where to use AI tools at work.
The two-day forum explored where Birkbeck currently stands in its approach to artificial intelligence and examined the opportunities, challenges, and risks it might face in the future.
Through presentations and break-out discussions, Birkbeck staff and external experts shared thought-provoking insights on AI in research, teaching, administration, management and leadership.
Joanne Leal, Pro Vice-Chancellor, Innovation and Academic Development said “I’m so pleased to see the level of excitement and possibility that has come out of Birkbeck’s AI Summit.
It’s even more encouraging given we had colleagues from across the University but also key external people who were able to contribute bold and innovative ideas to the discussions.
This is not a completely new conversation for us.
Birkbeck has been considering and addressing all of the opportunities, and challenges, associated with AI and we already have initiatives in place for areas such as teaching and assessment.”
Sean Green, Interim Chief Information Officer said, “When we set about putting together this Summit, we recognised that key to its success would be getting engagement from across the board, getting the right people in the room and importantly having the right people lead on the keynote presentations and other presentations; people who had prior experience and could set some benchmarks to guide the conversation.
I’m pleased to say we achieved all of that and more.”
The discussions, held in-person and online, delved into themes including AI’s impact on higher education, emerging trends and technologies, the responsible and ethical use of AI and practical applications in administration and leadership.
On day one of the Summit, Keynote speaker, Professor Kate Devlin (King’s College, London) presented, ‘Beyond the Hype: Generative AI in Higher Education’, looking at the transformative potential of new AI technologies and ways in which institutional policy and practice must evolve in response.
Bite-sized sessions, later in the morning, provided space to hear topics including ‘AI and Academic Integrity’ and ‘How UK institutions are using AI to transform the student experience’; with afternoon sessions including ‘Building a responsible AI strategy at Birkbeck’ and ‘Skills and Support needed for AI implementation’.
The second keynote presentation on day two of the Summit saw Dr James Wood from Bangor University present on ‘Assessment in the age of AI: What do we need to know?
What do we need to do?’, a topic that spoke to the concerns of a majority of participants and offered ways insightful to address them.
Day two also saw participants hear from a panel of external experts on 'AI and the Future of Work'.
Chaired by George Roussos, Professor of Pervasive Computing, the panel included Birkbeck alumnae Michelle Conway, Lead Data Scientist at Lloyds Banking Group and Fiona Dent, General Partner of Edge Investments.
Matt Franklin, Chief Strategy Officer from Roc Technologies completed the panel.
A fascinating and lively discussion followed that ranged across a wide spectrum of areas including the diverse applications of AI, how skillsets are evolving across different sectors, the importance of lifelong learning and the impact of AI on equality of opportunity.
Plans are now underway to engage with all staff on the consultation for the development of the AI policy framework over the Summer.
The Academic Standards and Quality (ASQ) team are holding sessions to support academic colleagues in testing the vulnerability of their assessments to unauthorized AI use and making them more robust, while on 30 July a workshop session to develop AI skills training will take place.
Birkbeck also continues to promote a suite of AI courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Alongside your contact hours, you will also undertake assessment activities and independent learning outside of class.
The amount of time you need to allocate to study both for taught sessions (this might include online sessions and/or in-person sessions) and personal study will depend on how much you are studying during the year and whether you are studying full time or part time.
Birkbeck’s courses are made up of modules and allocated ‘credit’.
One credit is equivalent to ten hours of learning time.
Modules are usually in 15, 30 or 60 credit units.
A 15-credit module will mean around 150 hours of learning, including taught sessions and independent study or group work.
This is spread out over the whole period of that module and includes the time you spend on any assessments, including in examinations, preparing and writing assessments or engaged in practical work as well as any study support sessions to help you in your learning.
On our distance-learning and blended-learning courses, discussion, collaboration and interaction with your lecturers and fellow students is encouraged and enabled through various learning technologies.
Timetables are usually available from September onwards and you can access your personalised timetable via your My Birkbeck Profile online (if you have been invited to enrol).
Class sizes vary, depending on your course, the module you are undertaking, and the method of teaching.
For example, lectures are presented to larger groups, whereas seminars usually consist of small, interactive groups led by a tutor.
On our taught courses, much of your time outside of class will be spent on self-directed, independent learning, including preparing for classes and following up afterwards.
This will usually include, but is not limited to, reading books and journal articles, undertaking research, working on coursework and assignments, and preparing for presentations and assessments.
Independent learning is absolutely vital to your success as a student.
Everyone is different, and the study time required varies topic by topic, but, as a guide, expect to schedule up to five hours of self-study for each hour of teaching.
Birkbeck offers study and learning support to undergraduate and postgraduate students to help them succeed.

    coursework.

    course'.
You will need to allow time to complete coursework and prepare for exams.
Where a course has unseen written examinations, these may be held termly, but, on the majority of our courses, exams
    are usually taken in the Summer term, during May to June.
Exams may be held at other times of the year as well.
In
    most cases, exams are held during the day on a weekday - if you have daytime commitments, you will need to make
    arrangements for daytime attendance - but some exams are held in the evening.
Exam timetables are published online.

The Chunhui Cup, jointly organised by China’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science and Technology, is a leading international platform designed to support overseas Chinese professionals in realising their entrepreneurial and innovative ambitions.

Reflecting on the courage and success of Chinese students in the UK, Professor Wheeler said:

Innovation and entrepreneurship are hardwired into your education culture, and we in the UK have much to learn from that.”

New sentences found on https://bbk.ac.uk/news/new-analysis-confirms-birkbeck-graduate-earnings-among-the-highest-in-the-country:
17 January 2022
Birkbeck placed third among all non-Russell Group universities and first among multi-faculty institutions for the likelihood of its graduates earning over £30,000 a year.
New analysis of data collected in 2019 by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), one of the official bodies tasked with gathering information about university performance in the UK, shows that 50% of Birkbeck graduates earn over £30,000pa six months after graduating.
This is considerably higher than the 37% average for Russell Group universities and it places Birkbeck third among all non-Russell Group higher education institutions in the country.
Only students graduating from the Royal Veterinary College and St George’s Medical School are more likely than Birkbeck students to earn over £30,000 a year.
The analysis, which was undertaken by online student news site, The Tab , shows a significant improvement in Birkbeck’s position on the previous year’s data (2018), when 38% of its students earned over £30,000 shortly after graduating, although even then it was placed fifth among non-Russell Group universities and above the Russell Group average.
Professor David Latchman, Vice-Chancellor of Birkbeck said: “Our courses are designed to allow students to work whilst they study with us, and most do, which gives them a head-start on the career ladder when they graduate.
We also have an excellent careers service which is very effective at helping students gain employment in prestigious roles that they want to do.
“These figures are based on students who studied with us prior to the pandemic.
Since then, we have introduced a new teaching model, which is now even more geared towards supporting students to work or maintain other commitments outside of their studies, as well as preparing graduates for work, so I would expect us to maintain or even improve on this position in the future.
We now provide in-person classes in the evenings on our central London campus supported by interactive online learning opportunities which mean that students can work during the day, whilst attending classes in the early evening, and doing some of their studies online, at times that are convenient to them.”

12 August 2025
Birkbeck Business School has been reaccredited by the Small Business Charter, receiving a three-year endorsement that recognises its continued excellence in supporting small businesses, student entrepreneurship, and the local economy.
The assessment process, which took place in June, involved contributions from academic and professional services staff, alumni, and Small and Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) leaders, reflecting a collaborative effort across the School.
The panel of assessors commended the School’s “robust, inclusive, and forward-looking enterprise and entrepreneurship ecosystem,” highlighting its strong physical presence in the local business community and its commitment to embedding enterprise across academic and extracurricular activities.
The reaccreditation enables Birkbeck to continue delivering the Help to Grow: Management course , a national initiative designed to support SME leaders.
Since its launch, the programme has connected the Business School with a wide network of small business leaders and decision-makers and Birkbeck is set to welcome its tenth cohort in September.
Professor Andy Adcroft, Head of Birkbeck Business School, said:
“The Small Business Charter is incredibly important to the Business School at Birkbeck.
Over the past few years, it has allowed us to engage with a range of dynamic and exciting businesses through the Help to Grow: Management programme, which has created a whole new group of stakeholders for us to work with.
The reaccreditation demonstrates our commitment to being an outward-looking business school that is always open to opportunities to put our world-class research to work as we support small businesses in their growth agenda.”
The School’s dedication to student enterprise was also praised, with particular recognition given to its flagship Pioneer 1.0 and Pioneer 2.0 programmes .
These initiatives have supported over 500 students in developing business ideas, equipping them with the skills, confidence, and networks needed to bring their ventures to life.
The Small Business Charter is awarded to business schools that demonstrate excellence in supporting small businesses, student enterprise, and local economic development.
Birkbeck joins 68 accredited institutions across the UK and Ireland.

31 July 2025
On 14–15 August 2025, Birkbeck, University of London will host a high-profile conference that asks the question: Does the world need a government?
Organised by the School of Natural Sciences and the Centre for the Study of Internationalism, the two-day event will convene leading thinkers, civil society groups and young voices to explore how global governance might evolve to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Held at Birkbeck’s Malet Street campus, the event will consider whether existing international institutions can effectively respond to global issues such as climate change, nuclear risk, artificial intelligence and space exploration.
Designed to encourage cross-sector dialogue, the event will bring together academics, campaigners, students and policy thinkers with ample opportunities for networking, exchange and collaboration.
Presentations will draw on law, philosophy, political science and planetary science.
Speakers will explore ideas including a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations, a revised UN Charter, and more inclusive models of global representation.
Among the contributors is Birkbeck’s Professor Daniele Archibugi, who will examine the role of the UN Security Council, and Gaia Vince, author of Nomad Century , who will speak on climate-induced migration.
The programme also features sessions on global health, space politics, and the implications of emerging technologies, including the governance challenges posed by AI.
Organising and chairing the conference is Professor Ian Crawford, Birkbeck’s Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology.
He emphasises the significance of the event:
“The continued survival and well-being of humanity on this fragile planet will likely depend on developing global political institutions capable of addressing existential threats.
This meeting is an opportunity to explore whether strengthened global governance, or even some kind of federal planetary government, might be necessary to secure our future.
Whether through reform or reinvention, the future of global cooperation is no longer a distant concern, but a vital contemporary issue which will affect us all.”
As global crises grow more interconnected, this conference offers a timely space to reflect, reimagine and ask what kind of international system would best benefit our world going forward.

New sentences found on https://bbk.ac.uk/news/birkbeck-launches-carena-institute-of-sustainable-archaeologies-thanks-to-transformative-gift-from-alumnus:
23 July 2025
The Carena Institute will be the first of its kind in the UK, setting a global standard for community-centred and environmentally responsible archaeological practice.
The personal gift from Marc, who graduated with an MA in Classical Archaeology from Birkbeck this year, will seed fund the Carena Institute’s first three years and support major research initiatives, teaching innovation and public engagement.
The donation will also fund three annual scholarships for Birkbeck’s MA in Archaeology and Heritage, opening doors to important work in this emerging field for students showing outstanding promise.
“I’m still struggling to believe it’s real,” said Dr Jen Baird, Director of Birkbeck’s MA Archaeology and Heritage programme and the new Director of the Carena Institute.
“I’m incredibly touched that having completed his MA at Birkbeck, Marc had such faith in us.
The gift will be transformative for our research and our teaching.”
Marc Carena, who works for Mars Incorporated and is the regional president for the Snacking division’s Europe & Central Eurasia business, said: “The Institute of Sustainable Archaeologies is the first of its kind in the world, and is pioneering a new area of research how to engage with the past, applying ethical, sustainable practices, respecting communities, to uncover legacies from ancient history to modern conflicts.
I feel truly honoured to have contributed to the creation of this institute, and deeply humbled that the University chose to name it after me.”
The Carena Institute will focus on addressing harmful legacies of extractive archaeological practices by fostering more ethical and sustainable approaches.
This involves collaborating with communities in the understanding and management of heritage sites and objects, as well as offering training, improving labour conditions in the field and making archaeological knowledge more accessible.
Dr Baird said: “Archaeology is an incredible way of understanding the past.
Because we look at objects, buildings, and landscapes, it’s an opportunity to learn about people and the societies from the ground up.
But, historically, this information has come at a cost.
I work in the Middle East and there’s unfortunately a long tradition of extractive practices: of taking objects, and knowledge, from the ground, but giving little back to local communities.
We are interested in working towards forms of archaeology that are conscious of these destructive pasts and look towards more sustainable practices in the future that are attentive to local needs and have social values at their core.”
With a core team of field-defining Birkbeck archaeologists - Dr Baird, Dr Esther Breithoff and Dr Lesley McFadyen - the Carena Institute will enable the advancement of research projects in Syria, Scotland and Paraguay, including in post-conflict zones and endangered landscapes.
It will also provide a platform for community partnerships, influence policy and practice and help define the emerging field of sustainable archaeologies.
“We have big plans,” said Dr Baird.
“The research projects across three continents all focus on what we consider a duty of care towards archaeology and the people it matters to.
We’re also looking forward to bringing our community-centred archaeological research agenda into our teaching, to create a pipeline of archaeologists and heritage professionals with a critically informed concern for sustainability.”
Professor Sally Wheeler OBE, Vice-Chancellor of Birkbeck, said: “The establishment of the Carena Institute is momentous for Birkbeck.
Through Marc’s investment in this pioneering initiative, we are able to advance in this important and emerging field and position ourselves as a global leader for teaching and research in Sustainable Archaeologies.
We are incredibly grateful for Marc’s support and confidence in Birkbeck.”
The Carena Institute will launch in the 2025–26 academic year with a programme of research, events and teaching to define the field and raise awareness.
In its first year, it will establish an online presence, host a landmark public lecture and develop a new sustainable pathway within the MA Archaeology and Heritage programme.
Plans are also underway to launch a dedicated MA in Sustainable Archaeologies , while expanding partnerships with organisations like Museum of London Archaeology and developing long-term funding and growth strategies.

New sentences found on https://bbk.ac.uk/news/elizabeth-and-daniel-peltz-obe-pledge-five-year-commitment-to-boost-birkbeck-postgraduate-scholarships:
17 July 2025
This renewed commitment ensures that aspiring part-time home or international postgraduates will continue to benefit from vital financial support at Birkbeck - opening doors to education, innovation and social mobility.
For the first time, two scholarships have been introduced for science students – one in the School of Natural Sciences and one in the School of Psychological Sciences.
Three other scholarships are available for students in the School of Historical Studies.
Hear from current Peltz scholars Marielle Birks (MA Victorian Studies), Rosie Tricks (MFA Theatre Directing) and Anne Williams (MFA Theatre Directing) on how the support has helped them access new opportunities to forge their future careers.
Daniel, who is both a governor and honorary fellow of Birkbeck, said: “Birkbeck’s distinctive model of education enables people from all walks of life to access high-quality learning while balancing work and other commitments.
“For many students, financial constraints remain a significant barrier to postgraduate study.
By helping to alleviate this burden through our continued support for these scholarships, we hope to empower individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds to pursue their academic and professional aspirations.
It is a privilege to support an institution that remains committed to flexible inclusive education across a wide range of disciplines, and to contribute to the success of those who are striving to change their futures through learning.”
This renewed pledge builds on the couple’s ongoing philanthropic support at Birkbeck, which has extended across research, students and facilities over the last 15 years.
Strongly advocating for the value of arts education, Elizabeth and Daniel funded several School of Arts scholarships in 2019.
Daniel himself studied for his own MA in Renaissance Studies at Birkbeck in 2009.
The couple’s previously philanthropic giving included the creation of the Peltz Gallery in 2013 and for cutting-edge technology in the Wohl Wolfson ToddlerLab - The Peltz CAVE.
The CAVE is an audio-visual, immersive, virtual reality environment, which can transport toddlers to different surroundings to see how they react to different scenarios and stimuli.

16 July 2025
As Birkbeck’s Wellcome Institutional Funding for Research Culture (IFRC) programme reaches its halfway point, a fourth round of grants has been awarded that will help researchers deepen their work in health research.
The funds will also contribute to a diverse, equitable and inclusive research culture.
The scope of support continues to grow, now including leadership training and extending to research support staff.
Leadership training
Researchers at all levels of experience are offered funding to undertake training to support their progression to leadership.
Health researchers, from postdoc to professor, have been offered training to support their progression to leadership, with courses ranging from group-specific to cross-sector.
Some courses are also tailored specifically to historically excluded groups.
Current awards include a Women in Leadership programme and a course specifically for people who identify as neurodiverse, disabled, or who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.
In addition, postdoctoral researchers from across the Faculty of Science have been funded to attend lab leadership sessions, while colleagues including professors and research support staff are attending cross-sector leadership and strategic planning training.
Awards for existing staff
Promoting an inclusive, collaborative approach to research, the panel has awarded two more ‘Nothing About Us Without Us’ projects in Psychological Sciences.
Professor Beth Grunfeld will work with migrant communities in the UK (and in particular in the London borough of Newham) to explore the key barriers to healthcare access in these communities, while Dr Victoria St.
Clair will collaborate with deaf children, adults and organisations to identify health research priorities.
This round has also seen the first Faculty Seed Fund award from Birkbeck Law School.
Professor Adam Gearey invites researchers to engage in wood carving workshops to help consider the trials of research as a creative process.
Salary extension schemes
These grants, designed for those at the end either of their PhD or postdoctoral fixed-term contract to consolidate their work and build their career path, are awarded to those working in health research who are from groups historically excluded in higher education.
A further five awards were granted in round 4:
Birkbeck offers its congratulations to all recipients of this award.
Professor Sally Wheeler, Vice-Chancellor commented:
“The continued growth of this programme, reaching right across our institution, highlights the power of and need for an inclusive and equitable culture for the future of health research.
It is encouraging to see new schools and departments represented, with projects that promise both targeted interventions and new modes of collaboration in the research community and beyond.
I offer my personal congratulations to everyone involved.”

Birkbeck’s Faculty of Science welcomed the public to a week of free evening lectures and events as part of its annual Science Week, held from 9–12 June 2025.
The series highlighted the faculty’s internationally recognised research across the Schools of Psychological Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Computing and Mathematical Sciences.
Designed for anyone with an interest in science, from interested members of the public to prospective student, the events were held both in-person at Birkbeck and streamed online to a global audience.
Each evening focused on a different area of science, offering attendees the chance to hear from leading researchers and engage with cutting-edge topics:
Science Week 2025 also celebrated the achievements of early career researchers with the presentation of three Science PhD Prizes—one from each School.
Attendees had the opportunity to learn about the prize-winning research through poster exhibitions and lab tours, and to meet the researchers during post-event receptions.
Reflecting on the week, Professor Rick Cooper, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Science, said:
“Science Week 2025 demonstrated some of the fascinating and impactful work of academic staff and early career researchers from across the Faculty.
Audiences were treated to topics ranging from cautionary tales of AI, to the use of imaging techniques in the natural sciences, and from understanding infectious diseases to the construction by the brain of our reality.
The event captured the importance of science in society, and Birkbeck's role in addressing key scientific questions.”

08 July 2025
PhD student, historian and author, Erin Fetterly, explores the process of writing an award-winning true crime book while doing a PhD in women’s history at Birkbeck.
In 2019 Erin completed an MA in British History at Birkbeck, where she focused on medicine in Georgian England.
Now in the third year of her PhD at Birkbeck, she is developing a thesis titled, The Intellectual Engagement of Georgian Britain’s Elite Women as Seen Through Their Manuscript Writing .
Alongside her studies, Erin wrote her first book, Women Who Kill: A History of Britain’s Most Dangerous Women , published in 2024.
In June 2025, it won the True Crime Awards’ Reader’s Choice Book of the Year.
Here, she discusses the experience of writing while studying and reflects on her time at Birkbeck.
How did Women Who Kill come about, what made you want to write it?
I write articles for a variety of independent history magazines, one of which is The Historian’s Magazine .
I wrote an article back in October 2021 for THM about 19th century Murderesses.
A commissioning editor at Pen and Sword publishers read it and asked if I was interested in expanding it into a book about the history of female killers, focusing particularly on the stories of these women and what may have led them to commit their horrible crimes.
I was VERY interested as women’s history is my focus, and it is a career goal of mine to uncover and share women’s stories from history with the world.
Did your academic work influence the book, or was it something that developed alongside your studies?
It really developed alongside my studies.
When I received the book offer in May 2022, I had just confirmed my enrolment to begin my PhD that fall, so the following 14 months were very hectic trying to balance both.
They are very different topics except for the fact that they both focus on telling women’s stories.
I enjoyed the fact that they were different however, because it gave my brain a refresh when I would switch back and forth from topic to topic.
It was also a different topic than my MA which was on Georgian medicine, but I have always been fascinated by the history of crime; I took related modules in my undergrad and MA, and wrote an essay during that time about the Elizabethan criminal underworld.
What drew you to women’s history in particular – and how has that shaped your current PhD research?
I love learning about women and uncovering fascinating female stories.
Yet women’s lives have often been under-researched and disregarded throughout history.
It’s made me determined to continue uncovering and disseminating them as widely as I can throughout my career.
Suzannah Lipscomb’s chapter ‘How do we uncover the lost lives of women?’ in her and Helen Carr’s edited collection What is History Now (2021) really inspired me and solidified what I wanted to do with my career and voice.
You studied your MA at Birkbeck, and are now doing a PhD here too - what kept you coming back?
First and foremost, London is my favourite city in the world.
It’s history, culture, architecture, beauty all make it a magical place.
Additionally, I was drawn to Birkbeck’s selection of courses for my MA and its flexible class structure and location.
I had had such a wonderful experience during my MA that I wanted to stay in the Birkbeck community, which is why I decided to do a PhD here.
Particularly important, was the amazing opportunity it provided me of doing a Distance Learning PhD.
I live in Ontario, Canada with my family but I am able to still attend Birkbeck.
I travel to London 1-2 times a year for several weeks which is a dream, and I do the rest of my research and writing at home.
Looking back on your time as a postgraduate student, is there anything that’s helped make the experience work for you or shaped your journey in an unexpected way?
As I previously said, the unique class structure worked well for me as I was able to do work and explore London during the day, have class at night and then be home by 8pm.
It was a brilliant schedule.
I also thrived being so close to all so many beneficial resources, particularly the British Library and the Wellcome Collection.
Being immediately surrounded by so much history in general was additionally inspiring and exciting while doing my own history research.
My MA also provided me with many valuable skills that have greatly helped me in my career so far including, writing, researching, formatting, networking, referencing and analysing.
How have you managed the balance between academic research and writing for a wider audience?
Has one changed how you think about the other?
Great question.
This has been tricky because until my book opportunity, I had only ever written academically, so it was a learning curve for sure.
Overall, I found it easier to write for a wider audience because it was more flexible, and I was able to put a little more of my voice and personality in it because it allows for a more approachable tone.
I also discovered that I really enjoy writing narratively, so I want to incorporate that energy into any future non-fiction books I write.
Your book recently won Reader’s Choice at the True Crime Awards.
What does that mean to you?
It means so much to think that all of the people who voted for me and my book really enjoyed it; connected to it; because it’s about women and women’s lives and much of the book highlights how the criminal justice system was biased and women suffered because of it.
To know that people enjoyed learning about these women is fulfilling and makes me look forward to sharing more stories in the future, hopefully getting as warm a reception.
Furthermore, it details some really wicked crimes and women, and it makes me happy that I was able to intrigue people with my research and storytelling.
It is very affirming, to have the public, not just a panel of judges, pick your book as their favourite.
I still can’t quite believe it.

It's quite nice to actually know people, and over time everyone's going to become more senior so having those connections will be really beneficial – I know I’ve made networks for life.
The teaching was stronger at Birkbeck than the university I did my undergraduate degree at
I was so impressed with how quick and thorough the replies to emails were, with any question that I had.
I think it's a feature of Birkbeck because people really want to be there.
I think this improves the relationship with lecturers because they know how hard you're working and how much you're putting in.
Most people also have jobs, which makes the lectures really interesting because you can draw from your own experiences and also hear about your classmates’ knowledge on other topics.
Being at Birkbeck built my confidence, professionally and personally
Having a Master’s degree to my name has built my confidence at work, because I feel more credible and knowledgeable.
When I was studying virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I learnt to connect with people in unconventional circumstances; with one girl, we were on Zoom calls for three hours a day leading up to the exams.
When things returned to normal after the pandemic, I met with people on my course and we now go out together for drinks as well as talk regularly on a group WhatsApp.
Gaining time management and organisational skills
I really developed my time management skills because of how much I had to balance when I was studying whilst working, which has served me well in my current role.
I also found I earned respect from my colleagues as I was able to do the degree on top of our long working hours.
Working whilst studying meant I didn’t have to compromise on my career
I think taking a whole year out from working to do a full-time Master’s would have made it much more difficult to get back into a firm, because it’s so competitive.
I’d recommend part-time study at Birkbeck to others – it’s a great way of getting a qualification without stopping or pausing your career.

Seeking a new path
I studied chemical engineering at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, and started working in investment banking in China immediately after.
I worked in this field for ten years, but often felt directionless and held back.

I found their teaching so knowledgeable and inspiring, that I realised I didn't want to leave the world of finance behind after all.

Both during and long after the pandemic everyone came together and encouraged each other so much.
As classmates, if one of us was struggling with our dissertation we'd go out for drinks to discuss it.

I felt so full of confidence from the quality of the teaching and the encouragement they provided every step of the way.
London is the perfect place to study
I studied both my previous degrees in London, and I'm glad I chose it again for this degree.

Moving forward with confidence
Since realising that accounting and finance are indeed the right paths for me, I've become excited about the future again.
I'm now undertaking the Associate Chartered Certified Accountant qualifications, and am looking forward to finishing them so I can progress even further in my field.
It's incredible to think that before this degree I felt so directionless, and now I feel so certain and focused.

11 November 2022
Paddy Munyui studied BSc Business whilst also running his own music management company.
From Brit Award nominations to recommitting himself to higher education, this is his story.
The start of something big
I started my music management company, RP Entertainment (RP Ents ) in November 2017, at a time when I had already applied and been accepted to study Law at a different university.
I had no idea at the time of starting RP E nts how fast things would escalate .
Before we knew it, one of my artists, Ramz , had a song that was number two in the official UK singles chart, and been nominated for a prestigious Brit award.
W hat I’d started was bigger than I imagined it could be , so I took a year out of studying to focus on RP E nts and looking after my artists.
Recommitting to education
By the time my year out was up, I decided that I wanted to study something different that would complement what I was doing with RP E nts .
I wanted to bring knowledge and theory to the day-to-day practicalities of what we were doing when running the company, and wanted a better understanding of the big picture – so I decided to study BSc Business at Birkbeck.
I liked the fact that Birkbeck allowed me keep my days free to attend meetings and planning sessions with music industry people and my artists.
It was a bit scary starting university all over again, and in a very different setting to before, but I said to myself: ‘ I’ve already started something new and put myself out there, I can do it again.
’
Determination and gratitude
I must admit, it was a really challenging first year , in terms of time management .

Spreading the word
Now, RP E nts is planning to expand our remit by doing talks and workshops in schools.
We want to talk to young people about the business of music and show them that aspiring to be the artist at the front and centre , isn’t the only way to be involved .
We want to show that it’s possible to work in the creative industries and also have an academic grounding and background.
It feels important to do , because so many people from my background don’t know about the opportunities available in the creative industries outside of stardom.
So many people see it as either you work in regular, corporate jobs, or you work in entertainment , not both.

22 February 2023
Thinking of doing something different?
Go for it.
At age 18 Alex Coles traded in the traditional university model to study BA Politics Philosophy and History at Birkbeck alongside a successful career as a professional rugby player, playing for Northampton Saints and occasionally England
When opportunity comes knocking
I've always wanted to go to university and as a teenager had big ambitions of studying something multidisciplinary like politics and economics; rugby had always just been a hobby.
But year on year, I seemed to progress until, in my final year of school, I was offered a professional contract with Northampton Saints, my local club from Cambridge.
Pursuing this new ambition meant I had to defer my university placements, so I told myself it was a gap year.
Making room for ambition
My career in rugby took off, and five years later I'm still playing professionally - I was even on the England squad last year!
But I never gave up on my ambition to study.
I really wanted to find a way to balance my career with studying, but I knew that a regular university structure wasn't compatible with the intensive rugby training and match schedule I have.
I considered the Open University but knew that wouldn't work either – I get more from structured learning, being in classrooms with people, exchanging ideas.
I needed something different.
An innovative solution
Evening study at Birkbeck was the perfect solution.
The campus is right near Euston station, which is where my commuter trains arrive in London, so it was ideal.
The lectures and seminars are structured to fit around your life, and it works.
Of course, combining a rigorous training and game schedule with classes and coursework deadlines has been challenging.
But the College has allowed me flexibility and understanding throughout, even when it's been really tricky.
Connecting with the wider world
My time at Birkbeck has felt really enriching.
Even now, in my final year, I'll attend a lecture or seminar about a topic and be buzzing about it all the way home.
Discussing subjects and ideas with classmates adds a whole other dimension too.
In rugby I meet lots of people with very similar backgrounds and worldviews.
Studying at Birkbeck allowed me to connect with people of all ages, from all over the world, with very different perspectives.
My horizons and understanding of the world have been broadened.
The benefits of studying and working
In professional rugby you ride the emotional wave of wins and losses a lot, and if you don't have other things going on in your life, it can really get to you.
It can also be a precarious career – you live contract to contract and there's a time limit to how long you can keep doing it.
Studying for a degree at Birkbeck provided me with a much-needed sense of perspective.
Playing a bad game or having a difficult training session was never the end of the world, because I had something else going on in my life that I cared about just as much.
Challenging stereotypes
I think there's a bit of a stereotype about rugby players, and I like the idea that I can break that.
I love to learn, and I use the self-discipline and drive that every professional sports person has to have towards my studies.
Hopefully one day, I can use it in the wider world too.
I'd love to go on to do further study, perhaps in Law or Economics and see where that might take my career one day.

Simon Bell shares his story of how he overcame his disability to pursue a Master's degree in Marketing, resulting in a deepened understanding of the field and advancement of his career.
I have a history of facing challenges during my university education; in 2013, I graduated with a BA (Hons) in Photography, following a close family bereavement in the final year.
More recently, my own chronic illness tried and failed to prevent me from my goals.
In 2015 after exploring photography as a career for two years, I embarked on a change in direction towards marketing, originally in adult retail for two years and then solidifying that direction in the photographic technology sector.
After more than four years in the field, my career progression stagnated, and I realised that I lacked certifiable credentials to evidence my expertise.
Alongside this, I was also dealing with getting a diagnosis for and managing my hidden disability.
In 2018, shortly after participating in a rowing competition in Paris, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease.
I want to do more to raise awareness of this hidden disability - it can be an embarrassing topic, but it is more common and life-limiting than most imagine.
The chronic illness significantly impacted my life; it induced anxiety over transport and meant a lot of time spent at hospitals having tests and infusions, regularly being on steroids, taking 17 pills a day and most sadly, giving up my hobby of rowing.
In 2020 I started looking into various accredited courses and other options and decided to pursue a Master's degree in Marketing, feeling it would have more reach and gravitas as a qualification.
The fact that the MSc Marketing course at Birkbeck is accredited by the leading professional body for marketers worldwide, the Chartered Institute of Marketing, meant I would be equipped with the best opportunity for developing my career.
I was also still working full-time and didn't want to take a career break to study, so Birkbeck's evening study model was the ideal solution.
Balancing my studies with full-time work was a challenge, but one that I was willing to take on to help get ahead in my career and with the help of Birkbeck's Disability Support team , I was able to manage my health and my studies simultaneously.
They provided me with resources and allowances that made it possible for me to continue my studies without sacrificing my health.
Birkbeck's approach to my illness was not only useful but also very human.
One of my tutors even wrote a personal note of encouragement to me when she found out what I'd been going through.
In 2022, the last year of part-time study, it became evident that therapeutic options for managing my colitis had all failed and that surgery was the only option left.
This coincided with my dissertation and after applying for mitigating circumstances, I was awarded a 10-week extension.
Fortunately, I was able to start the research element of the dissertation before going into hospital, and during this time a huge number of participants completed my survey, enabling me to get started once I had recovered four weeks later.
In the next two months, I both worked and completed all 12,900 words of my dissertation, researching as I went and achieved a mark of 73%, an achievement I'm super proud of.
Studying has been an incredibly beneficial journey for me, both in theory and practice.
I gained new insights into marketing and learned from experts in the field; I particularly found the elements of my course that covered branding interesting and have enjoyed applying them in my day-to-day work.
The skills and knowledge I gained through my studies also helped me become more confident in my abilities as a marketer, which translated to success in my career.

Here, he shares his story.
Tell us about yourself.
I am from Kurdistan, northern Iraq, and I work in the arts and culture industry.
I recently began a new role at Kashkul , a research, preservation, and translation collective based at American University of Iraq, Sulaimani.
I credit my Master’s from Birkbeck in equipping me with the right tools to take on such a senior position at the university.
My new job will involve working on preservation, archiving, literary translation and publishing books.
In my previous position, I was running the UNESCO designation office for the city of Slemani (UNESCO City of Literature).
Why did you decide to apply for a Chevening scholarship?
After two years of working, I was well equipped as an arts administrator from a practice point of view.
But then I realised that the Master’s in Arts Policy and Management at Birkbeck would really help to equip me theoretically.
Why Birkbeck?
I was accepted by three universities, but chose Birkbeck because of the mor e personal approach.
Birkbeck was the only university that invited me to an interview where I met the head of the programme and one of the main lecturers, and that really meant a lot to me.
It really made it more human .
Tell us about what living in London was like?
I applied to Goodenough College, which is a postgraduate student residence in Bloomsbury, just a seven-minute walk from Birkbeck’s main campus.
I was lucky to live t here and forged relationships with other students from more than 100 nationalities.

19 October 2022
Eliana Valdez, MSc Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology student, came to Birkbeck as a Chevening Scholar.
Here she talks about her experience as an international student coming to study in the UK.
The Chevening Scholarship is a programme that offers exceptional professionals from around the world the opportunity to study in the UK.
As exciting as it is to have the opportunity to come to the UK and study something you’re passionate about, it can also be intense and nerve wracking.
When you arrive as an international student, it’s not just your studies that you’re dealing with, it’s all the other changes too.
It’s moving to the UK, looking for accommodation, adapting to the weather, the people, the culture.
It's a lot to deal with beside studying.
I chose Birkbeck because I felt so supported in all of this.
When I applied to other universities, I just couldn't find the same feeling of support: they’d take incredibly long to reply to my email queries about the process of studying in the UK for example, or they wouldn’t ask me important questions needed for my application.
I thought, why should I go somewhere that can’t support me?
But with Birkbeck, from the moment I applied, I felt huge support from many departments.
The team of staff who work closely with i nternational s tudents helped with all my administrative queries swiftly and in detail.
The communication between Birkbeck and Chevening was also excellent, which made things easier for me when first arriving to the UK.
The international team were also great at helping me get started academically.
I initially struggled with my writing because English is not my native language.
I realised from feedback on my first essay that I needed to sharpen my grammar and communication skills , and found there was fantastic support for this with the Study Skills and Stud iosity sessions offered.
But Birkbeck provides more than just administrative and academic support for international students.
The international team also organise s events that helped me get to know other Chevening scholars: there are more than 30 of us!
The events helped build a support network, and now all the scholars are friends ; we socialise and get together.
There are also clubs and societies for international students that are frequently promoted, so you get to know people from many other countries who are studying here.
Birkbeck doesn’t just expect international students to turn up, study, and be challenged with the transition of moving abroad.
They want us to succeed, and they know that we can’t succeed if we’re not well-informed, if we’re not feeling seen and understood, or if we have issues with gaps in our study skills.
They do everything they can to help with that.
When I understood this, I knew right away that Birkbeck was my university.
They chose me, and I chose them .

In her quest to drive social change, international student Jennifer Francis decided to study MRes Social Research and Psychosocial Studies at Birkbeck.
She shares her thoughts on how education can make a difference in the world, and why Birkbeck’s radical history made it the ideal place for her to start advocating for social change.
I never imagined I would go back to university again
When I studied in the United States, where I'm from, I majored in psychology.
I loved the subject but found studying intense and didn't see myself doing it again unless it was for something that I really cared about.
I've spent my career so far working in marketing and advertising at various agencies.
I wasn't exactly a-political, but I don't think I interrogated the way things are in society much; I assumed the important things in life would be taken care of by the systems in place.
Wanting to drive change
The last few years have brought a lot of societal issues to the forefront of my mind, from Black Lives Matter to the fight against climate change.
I see how the systems the world is built around aren't designed to help the most vulnerable people or protect this planet.
I stopped believing that the powerful take care of those who need it most.
I felt frustrated with the level of inequality I saw in the world, and its cost to both human lives and the planet.
I know I'm just one person, but I wanted to do something, anything, towards combating inequality in the world.
Educating myself seemed like a good place to start.
A place to nurture learning
My husband is from the UK, so when it was confirmed that we would move there from the US, I looked for postgraduate social science courses that could equip me with the knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in the world.
I have a strong interest in research, and wanted a course that would feed that interest.
I chose MRes Social Research and Psychosocial Studies at Birkbeck not only because it had a great curriculum that offered many research opportunities, but also because of the affordability of being able to work by day and study by night.
A radical history that informs a transformative future
As an institution that saw the value in my lived experience, Birkbeck also felt like a place that would nurture my learning, even though my undergraduate was not in the same subject area I wanted to study.
It's an inclusive and open environment, which was important to me.
Firstly, as an international student, it put my mind at ease that I'd be welcomed and adequately supported, which has been the case.
Secondly, I wanted to do something geared towards social justice and change, and Birkbeck is an institution whose history is literally founded off those principles .
It puts learning and access to learning first.
In my time here, I've seen my professors do amazing things both in the classroom and in the world of research, and it's been inspiring.
They care about impact, but they also care about opening-up perspectives by asking the right questions: who benefits from societal systems?
Why do people strive for certain things in life?
Who votes for which political party, and why?
Perspective is powerful
The most valuable thing I've learned at Birkbeck is to remember that your viewpoint is just one perspective, and that there are a myriad of ways of analysing a situation - which is why perspective is so powerful.
In social science there is not always a single truth you are measuring.
More often, you are studying various perspectives, their relationships to power, and how these relationships have contributed to the systems we have in place.
That's why I believe that studying social systems and understanding them can lead to change.
Too many of the world's injustices, whether relating to gender, race or class are seen as one-off issues that sit separate to how the world is structured.
I believe there needs to be more research into inclusive and sustainable systems and what those would look like.
My dissertation is about the entwinement of climate change and capitalism, and after I finish studying, I'd like to enter the world of policy research or do research at a non-profit.
I want to help create systems and policies that support a more sustainable and equal world.

05 October 2022
Double take: Wasif Sajjad, MSc Climate Change student received invaluable help and support from his dissertation supervisor, Dr Becky Briant, Reader in Quaternary Science, during his Master’s degree.
Here, both share their sides of the story.
Wasif :
I was aged 40 when I opted to start a Master’s in Climate Change.
Birkbeck gave me the opportunity to study whilst working full time in a bank.
Returning to study after a 20-year gap in a totally different education system in a new subject was not an easy task.
I am glad I took the initiative to study at this stage of life where it was solely for the sake of knowledge rather than for building a career.
Studying at Birkbeck not only taught me research and data analysis skills, but it also broadened my horizons.
Unfortunately, studying became quite challenging for me when it coincided with a series of unfortunate events in my personal life, including loss of loved ones and health issues.
However, my supervisor, Dr Becky Briant, understood my situation and provided invaluable support.
In fact, I couldn't have completed my degree without Becky’s help and guidance.
The most important lesson I learnt in this journey is that if you want to attain something, just take the initiative and start.
The journey might not be easy but if you are determined - you will succeed eventually.
Becky:
I first met Wasif when he was a student on the Climate Change module I was directing.
Wasif came to me asking for support, and I helped him on a variety of aspects he was finding challenging, including note taking, constructing an argument, using references correctly and citing properly.
We have an open-door policy at Birkbeck, and really encourage students to approach us when they need help or have questions.
A few months later, Wasif was planning his dissertation topic on changes in amounts of freshwater going into the Arctic from rivers, which happened to be in my field of expertise, so I became his dissertation supervisor.
We discussed what data was available together and Wasif learnt complicated statistics – throughout his studies he really impressed me with his work ethic.
Wasif made a lot of progress throughout his Master’s degree, despite several setbacks.
He successfully transitioned back into university-level study in another country, having done his undergraduate degree in Pakistan.
Wasif’s perseverance, enthusiasm, and desire to learn was really admirable and I thoroughly enjoyed supporting him throughout his journey at Birkbeck.

Pamela Odumusi was in her third year of work when she realised she wanted to do a degree in gender studies but didn’t want to stop working.
Pamela graduated from an MA in Gender, Sexuality and Culture earlier this year.
The perfect opportunity I studied advertising for my undergraduate degree, and quickly learnt the best way to get far in media is to have a real passion for your role.
So, I identified specific areas which I find interesting and specialised in them to make myself valuable on my teams, which led me to working as a Digital Manager.
But I also knew that I wanted to keep studying.
My undergraduate dissertation focused on feminism and femininity in teen films, which I've always loved, and ever since finishing my undergraduate degree, I knew that I wanted to further explore teen films, but from a lens that also considered my perspective as a Black girl consuming the genre in the 2000's.
However, I felt I was on a good career trajectory, so I was hesitant to stop working to make time to study.
I was Googling away, looking for a solution when Birkbeck came up.
It seemed like the perfect opportunity – to study in the evenings and continue working.
In most cases I would have had to stop work completely and take two years out, whereas studying at Birkbeck allowed me to continue spending my days at work.
Birkbeck is about determination Studying alongside work during the pandemic was a huge challenge, and I really missed not being surrounded by people during the days and nights.
But I knew I wasn't alone.
Everyone that comes to Birkbeck has their own situation at home - whether they're working, or they've got kids, or they've got something else going on in their lives.
That really came through when I spoke to people on different courses or different modules, everyone was so motivated.
Being around people who are determined to get their degree was a source of real inspiration.
A supportive learning environment There was a lot of support from other people studying; we shared questions, thoughts and experiences, bouncing ideas off each other to help each other succeed.
This determination to succeed was matched by the lecturers' dedication and support to help us do so.
Everyone was so accommodating and attentive.
If I had to miss a lecture or needed help on an assignment, the Birkbeck staff were always on hand and understanding.
I noticed through my time at Birkbeck that not only was there a massive improvement in my writing but I'm also a better problem-solver now.
Having to constantly think of the best way to approach an essay or chapter of a dissertation really makes you sit back and question if there are different ways around an issue.
Studying while working made me stand out Embracing the challenge of balancing full-time employment with studying was noticed by my employers.
It's a big deal!
They see me as someone with ambition, someone willing to go out of my way to complete something.
And that makes me stand out, because it's not necessarily something you expect people to be doing or have completed while working.
I was a freshly made Digital Manager when I first started studying and had been promoted up to Digital Director by the final months of my Master's.
Eventually, I'd love to do a PhD to further explore race in film, particularly the complex relationship Black women and girls have with the medium.
For now, I'm taking the time to enjoy my job and the new possibilities open to me at my current level.
If anyone is thinking of working and studying at the same time, I'd say take the time to enjoy the process; it's a once in a lifetime experience!

Double take: MSc Marketing Communications graduate, Natalia Schimbator, and Birkbeck Careers Advisor, Julia De Cruz, talk about the value that the Birkbeck Futures Careers Service adds to the student experience.
Natalia:
I worked in TV Journalism for many years in Romania, where I developed my organizational and managerial skills on international TV formats, like Got Talent and MasterChef.
When I moved to the UK with my fiancé, I had to decide which transferrable skills from my career in TV I could use the most, and I remembered how I was always fascinated by the interactions I had with PR and Marketing departments in my TV work, so I decided to deepen those skills by doing the MSc in Marketing Communications at Birkbeck .
While studying, I heard about Birkbeck's Careers Service, Birkbeck Futures.
I signed up to their newsletters and started receiving job alerts for marketing roles, which I regularly applied to.
Initially I didn't have much success, but with the help of the Birkbeck Futures team, that soon changed.
I attended the Birkbeck Futures Summer Bootcamp, which offered really insightful workshops and helpful tips that have stuck with me to this day.
The one-to-one sessions helped me optimise my CV, focus on my strongest skills, and communicate with impact, which is so important when applying for a job.
Soon after, I applied for two jobs from two top employers in the industry and got interviews with both.
I didn't know it at the time, but I was about to meet my future employer!
Birkbeck Futures provides tailored support for students looking to capitalise on the knowledge and skills gained during their studies here.
The Careers Summer Bootcamp was an amazing initiative that I'd recommend to anyone.
The team operate in a very friendly, kind yet professional manner, always making themselves available and putting lots of energy into organising useful events.
I chose Birkbeck for three reasons: it offered flexibility in terms of blending part-time study with part-time work; it's a global meeting point which offered the chance to befriend students from all corners of the world; and its rich history of academic brilliance.
The fact that Birkbeck offered invaluable support beyond what was taught in the classroom, was an added bonus, it helped me land a job at a top company in the UK!
I'd like to thank Birkbeck Futures for their hard work and dedication to help students embark in new careers.
Their guidance, and carefully planned one-to-one sessions with career coaches has the potential to change someone's journey – that's special.
Julia:
What makes my job as a Careers Advisor at Birkbeck so special is that I get to meet such a great range of students; from those with no work experience at all, through to seasoned professionals wanting to develop their skills, or change direction.
When Natalia came to Birkbeck Futures she already had a fascinating work history behind her, but just needed some focused support to identify the transferable skills she already had from TV journalism and highlight the new learning that her Master's degree had given her.
I've reviewed hundreds (possibly thousands!) of CVs and the struggle to explain and demonstrate skills is very common.
There's a tendency to downplay achievements, so it's my job to help students create a top-quality, custom-made CV that makes it to the top of the 'YES' pile.
It's great that Natalia gained so much from our Futures Summer Bootcamp.
It's in its third year now and last month's event was packed full of great events and top advice from employers including Google, BAFTA, Huel, PensionBee and many more.
The Birkbeck Futures team supports students throughout the year; promoting jobs, signposting careers advice, supporting entrepreneurial students with our Pioneer Programmes , the Ability Programme for students and recent graduates with a disability, neurodiverse or long-term health condition, and our Career Coaching Programme for those who need more focused direction in their journey.
We're always looking to the future, so we're excited to be piloting new credit-bearing careers modules this coming year with workshops, events and work experience via our new microplacements.
Everybody deserves to be doing a job they love; we hope we can play a part in making this happen, just like we did for Natalia.

Undertaking the degree that bridged that gap between the theory and knowing how to go out into the world and practice as an organizational psychologist has been incredibly useful, and it’s meant I’m better equipped to teach my students and support them with what they want to do in the future.

But I also wanted to keep working, so Birkbeck’s evening study model seemed like the ideal answer.
I decided to study history, as I’d always loved it at school, and when I found out Birkbeck offered a BA History and Archaeology course, I thought that could add an interesting dimension to it and went for it.
Investing in myself
Between starting my undergraduate degree and finishing it, I got a new job, doing operations in finance, and that’s when my interest in corporate responsibility and sustainability (CSR) first started.
I was lucky enough to then get a CSR entry level role Lloyd’s, and soon my manager started talking about getting me up-skilled.

A typical day for me would start with a jog in the park I love London’s many open spaces where I regularly go out for a jog or relax in the afternoons.
I would then take my live sessions from home but sometimes use the library if I happened to have a book that I needed to collect or drop off.

Double take: Master’s student and Birkbeck Mentoring Pathways mentee Dimitrios Kelaidonis, and his mentor, former Birkbeck student Emma Davis, Deputy Head of Mission, British Embassy Guinea, share their experience of working together through the mentoring programme, which offers the opportunity for final year students to be matched with a professional mentor drawn from Birkbeck graduates and corporate partners.
Dimitrios :
After completing an undergraduate degree in European Studies in Greece, I came to Birkbeck to do a Master's in International Security and Global Governance .
I wanted a career in foreign affairs, and Birkbeck's course, combined with its history seemed like a great springboard for that.
So, I moved to a new country; I was juggling work with study, the pressures of the pandemic, and trying to build a network and social life.
I decided to participate in as many initiatives that Birkbeck has to offer, to meet new people and gain valuable experiences.
That's how I found the Mentoring Pathways programme .
I thought it could be an interesting way to develop professionally and personally.
And it was great because my mentor, Emma, was not just someone with lots of knowledge and advice, she was also a Birkbeck alumna, so we had this natural connection.
Emma and I agreed to keep meeting so long as I got something out of the sessions, or until the objectives we set together were met, and as we kept meeting, we developed a worthwhile relationship.
Through our sessions, I managed to develop my oral and written language skills, and I got valuable insights on various topics I was covering in my academic studies.
What's more, I got vital guidance on my career options, my approach to CV building, and interview preparation.
After my Master's, when I was job-hunting, she really encouraged me and made me think about my options.
Emma is Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Guinea, and I wanted to work in Foreign Affairs, which is a very competitive field, so Emma listened to what I wanted then shared her own knowledge, experiences and contacts with me.
My main aim is to change the world through my ideas and what I've learned at Birkbeck.
Thanks to my Master's and Emma's advice and support, I'm now doing a traineeship in Brussels in the European Parliament in the security and defence sector, as a junior policy advisor.
Emma:
I've always admired the Birkbeck ethos of being a university for working people and the idea that university education is open to everyone.
I found my time at Birkbeck studying Management really valuable, so when I got the alumni email into my inbox asking for mentors to sign up for the Mentoring Pathways programme to be matched with current students, I thought, 'Yeah, why not?
Pay it forward!'
We had a mentor training session with the programme organisers, and I found that useful.
I must admit, at the start of the mentoring, I stuck to the provided tips and structure quite tightly.
But by the end, as Dimitrios' confidence grew, and our relationship developed, the sessions were more free-flowing, and we were both feeding naturally off each other.
There's a great sense of value in being a mentor and knowing that you've helped someone on their path.
To me, mentoring isn't about just telling someone exactly what they should or shouldn't do.
It's about showing an interest in them, providing a different point of view for them, maybe being a sounding board.
It can make such a difference to someone.
And it can be tempting to say 'do it this way' to your mentee, but everyone is different and may need or want different things, so really, it's about asking open questions and making them think.
What's really interesting is that as a mentor, you're also learning.
Dimitrios is such a conscientious young man, and it's good to meet people who are younger, who have different life experiences, different challenges to what you've had.
It's definitely a two-way street, because it allows you to keep your finger on the pulse of culture, industry and society.

Usha Rasagopal graduated this week with a BA English degree, a great feat given her tumultuous journey to Birkbeck.
A challenging c hildhood
My upbringing in Sri Lanka was very unsettled because of the civil war which began in 1983 and ended just over a decade ago.
I was unable to finish my A-Levels when the exams were postponed due to the conflict , and I started working as an interpreter.
Reading was my source of escapism
My father taught me English growing up .
I was a d addy’s girl and I wanted to copy whatever he did.
Before the war, we read together, watch ed sport together and discuss ed world events, past and present.
When my father very sadly passed away, reading was the only pleasure I had.
I read whatever I could to increase my knowledge of the world.
This love of reading and learning the English language, landed me with a job as an interpreter, translating Tamil into English and vi ce versa .
I moved to the UK in 201 1 without my husband
At the end of civil war, both my husband and I were wounded.
We escaped from the concentration camp and I obtained refugee status in the UK .
However, since we had lost all our documents, I struggled to prove to the immigration courts that I’m married and that the person I was trying to sponsor via family reunion was my husband.
Pursuing my dream of studying English
After having suffered so much trauma in my life, I was desperate to find something rewarding and positive.
I wanted to find another source of identity and I knew that studying English at degree level would be hugely gratifying.
A charity worker suggested Birkbeck to me, and I applied and got in!
It was a very happy day.
Progressing forward
It’s been a great learning experience , but I wouldn’t say doing a degree was easy and at times I really struggled , but I wanted to progress forward, physically and mentally .
I grasped all the help that was offered and used most of Birkbeck’s brilliant support services , including disability support for my mobility issues and mental health support.
I also did my degree part-time, so I could continue my work as a sales assistant and interpreter while being a carer for my disabled husband.
I thank Birkbeck from the bottom of my heart
Birkbeck gave me the chance to study.
I’m still a victim and I can’t trace out my traumatic experiences, especially from the end of the civil war, but now I’m something else along with it.
I want to pass on a message to others in similar situations - th ough you can’t wipe away what happened, you can find and do something else to give you positivity and enjoyment.
I am continuing to pursue my passion , and this October I started a Master’s degree in Victorian Studies at Birkbec k , with the ultimate goal of becoming a university lecturer in the future.

Entrepreneur Alexander Flint Mitchell gave up studying law to enroll on a master’s in Business Innovation at Birkbeck to kickstart his business, a matchmaking app with a difference.
I had a lightbulb moment
The idea of matchmaking app came to me whilst I was working in the City as an internationally qualified lawyer.
I found the reality of being a lawyer very boring and would end up spending most of the day daydreaming about a concept for an app, and the research I was conducting for it, which I coined ‘Blind Cupid’.
I had to pursue my idea
I gave up my legal career and enrolled at Birkbeck, initially working in the day and studying in the evening.
One of the early modules, Entrepreneurial Venture Creation, required us to write a business plan.
That’s when I decided to quit my day job to commit fully to Blind Cupid.
Blind Cupid is matchmaking app with a difference
The app uses a never-before-used science to match people based on their fundamental values, giving users the chance to know that they are in fact compatible before they even engage with matches.
The greatest thing about this technology is that it can be used in any app in the world - meaning that users of Bumble, Hinge and more can now find out if the people that they are talking to on those apps are compatible with them.
This has never been done before.
My Master ’ s degree felt like mentorship
The content of my course taught me so much and the different personalities of the academics made each module enjoyable.
Alongside my Master’s, I enrolled on Birkbeck’s Pioneer programme , which helps students and alumni start and grow their businesses.

Today I manage a team of 16
We’ve successfully raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to bring conceptual philosophy into technology for the first time; we’ve created the world’s first decentralised compatibility platform that can power the whole dating market, and more.
We have plans to license our matchmaking technology to other apps and have set our sights on entering other markets with our technology, such as recruitment, where compatibility matters.

26 August 2025
When Amir Khan moved from Mumbai to London in January 2023 to study an MSc in Management at Birkbeck, he was chasing a long-held dream to work and learn in the UK.
One year later, he graduated not only with his degree, but with a deeper sense of community, belonging and purpose.
A key part of his Birkbeck journey was joining the Mentoring Pathways programme, which gives students the opportunity to engage in a mentoring relationship with alumni and corporate volunteers.
Amir was paired with business development consultant Phill Collins, who was awarded the Mentor of the Year at the 2025 Mentoring Pathways celebration event after he was nominated by his current mentee Inna Kucherenko.
Amir said: “No matter how smart you are, you always need someone to hold your hand and be a listening ear, particularly if you are in new surroundings, like I was.
Phill gave me very important guidance - he motivated and pushed me to explore different career paths and figure out how to get where I wanted to go.”
Throughout Amir’s time at Birkbeck, the two regularly met in person and have stayed in contact since.
He said: “When I landed my first job as a GTM – Enterprise Sales professional at FutureMatch, Phill was one of the first people I told.
He was super happy for me.
We’re still in touch, and it meant a lot to see him again at the celebration event.”
Phill added: “I’m really pleased that Amir has stepped up to be a mentor.
His work ethic was extraordinary.
I suspect a lot of people are put off from mentoring because they don't feel that they've got the right experience, the right gravitas or that they're old enough maybe.
But it’s not always about that.
It's about having an impartial third party you can talk to.
I know Amir will be a great mentor and a listening ear.”
Before joining Birkbeck, Amir had been working full-time as a business analyst in the tech sector in Mumbai after earning a Bachelor’s in Technology in Electronics Engineering.
What drew him to Birkbeck was not just the course, but the people.
He said: “Birkbeck is in the heart of London, which was a big draw.
But more importantly, the students here are working in the real world.
I liked that community aspect, I was learning from classmates who were already in the corporate world.
That environment gave me a real push.”
That momentum, along with Amir’s drive to succeed, helped him secure three internships during his course: at 100 Degrees Consulting as a Business Consultant, at BreakBottle as a Growth Strategist, and at Blueshift Education in Business Development.
Two of them came through Birkbeck’s Handshake platform, with strong support from the Careers Team.
He said: “I’m really grateful to Birkbeck for helping me tailor my CV, cover letters and overall job search.
I also received great support from my career coach, Nadiya Mahmud, who was another big part of my Birkbeck experience.
Everything positive that happened created a domino effect, and I truly believe it was all made possible because of Birkbeck and the community of great minds.”
Amir also embraced other opportunities on campus, serving as a Student Ambassador and taking part in the Pioneer Programme, designed to help select students develop the knowledge and skills needed to successfully start a business.
As a new international student, Amir found that vital support was available to him at Birkbeck.
He was awarded a £1,000 Santander Scholarship to help with living costs and allowed him to attend tech and business events to gain a deeper understanding of the local professional culture.
He was also grateful to have access to the Birkbeck Students’ Union Food Pantry.
He said: “It’s very expensive to come to London and the food pantry helped offset some of those costs.
It meant I didn’t have to worry about grocery bills during the first few months.”
A personal highlight from his time at Birkbeck was a last-minute arrangement from the events team to ensure he could attend his graduation ceremony after the deadline passed.
Amir said: “It was a touching moment that reflected Birkbeck’s genuine support and how strong relationships built during my time there came full circle.”
Inspired by the invaluable support he received, Amir knew he wanted to give back.
He said: “Birkbeck gave me so many opportunities and I learnt so much while navigating life as an international student.
Once I graduated, I thought it was time to give back to Birkbeck students - especially other international students who might just need a listening ear or someone to validate them.”
Amir helped his first mentee map out his journey into the music industry, looking into the skills companies were looking for.
With another mentee, he focused on internship options and goal-setting.
Amir says he’s definitely going to carry on as a mentor so that he can be the “kind of senior I once looked up to as a junior”.
Now seeking his next step in the tech industry, Amir continues to pay it forward - one mentee at a time.

Lawrence in the Anthropocene, ed.
by Terry Gifford (under contract with Edinburgh University Press, forthcoming 2024/5).
My forthcoming monograph, The Embodied Reader in D.H.
Lawrence’s Criticism and Fiction : Reading, Feeling and Narrative Form , offers a new reading of Lawrence’s critical and fictional modernism, setting it in dynamic dialogue with a recent, multifaceted turn in literary studies towards readers’ affective and embodied responses to texts.
It argues that Lawrence’s critical works register, in their turbulent forms as well as their overt statements, the felt dimension of literary response, and explores how his affectively-charged critical practice is rooted in a distinct early-twentieth-century culture of autodidactic reading.
Attending to Lawrence’s critical aesthetics of embodied reading, the book further argues, sheds new light on the means by which Lawrence’s own modernist fiction engages felt responses in the reader, and in particular the ethical significance of these.
My other main area of interest is in ecocriticism, and especially literature's potential to shape or voice an ecological ethics.
I am also completing a novel that explores, in the form of a near-future fictional memoir, the unfolding, incalculable effects of ecological breakdown in rural Britain.

I joined Birkbeck as Head of the Business School in August 2024 following a decade in leadership positions at Surrey Business School.
I started my 30 year academic career as a political economist but have spent the last decade as an influential researcher in management education where I have won national awards for my scholarly and collaborative work.
I am a National Teaching Fellow (2015) and a winner of a Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (2024).
Opening up the academy to the wider world is core to my work and in doing this I have undertaken activities which run from ESRC funded impact programmes to stand up comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe to co-hosting a breakfast radio show.
Over the past 30 years, my research has come in three waves: • As a political economist working in an established research team based at the universities of East London, Aberystwyth, Royal Holloway and Manchester; • Public sector management in general and higher education policy in particular; • Pedagogy and two key relationships – between feedback and performance and between motivations to study, expectations of studying and learning strategies.
More recently my work focuses on curiosity and its impact on academic performance.
People learn best when they work things out for themselves.
If I had something so grand as a philosophy of teaching that would be it.
I believe in people taking responsibility for their learning, that University is a place where people come to learn rather than just to be taught and, most important of all, that learning only happens when you participate.
Spectators don't learn half as well as participants.

â¢  How many students were invited to attend a viva following the submission of this assignment?
Response: 7 â¢  How many students passed the viva?

â¢  How many failed the viva?
Response: As above.
â¢  How many were referred or are being referred to a panel hearing following a viva?
Response: Less than 5.

â¢  How many assignments included no references?

â¢  How many assignments included no citations and no references?
Response: This depends on what is counted as citations and references.
The following was used as definition: â¢  Any CW that references an external source, such as a webpage URL, is counted as a citation; â¢  Any CW that contains a semi-formal bibliography, so a simple collection of links was not counted while one with additional bibliographic information was counted as reference; â¢  Any CW that falls in the second category also falls in the first category.
Using that criteria there are 20 CWs with citations and 5 containing references out of 41 submissions.
Response: 7
â¢  How many students passed the viva?
Response: 41
â¢  How many of the submitted assignments included references?

Has the university noticed a particular spike in cases since 2022/2023, when AI tools like ChatGPT became more advanced and their use more widespread?
What methods or tools does the university use to detect AI-generated work in student submissions (e.g., Turnitin AI detection, GPTZero)?
Response: Turnitin AI Detection Tool.
The College is in the process of adopting a broad three-tiered categorisation scheme, which sets out where AI use is permissible.
The use of the Turnitin AI Detection Tool will, in future, be determined by which category each individual assessment is designated, either category 1, AI cannot be used; category 2, AI is permitted in an assistive role; or category 3, AI has an integral role.
Only those assessments which fall under category 1 will be submitted to the Turnitin AI Detection Tool, for checking.
The College is also undertaking review of assessment design and developing an assessment framework over academic year 2024-25.
In the context of academic integrity and misconduct, reports produced by the tool function as one source of information only.
The Turnitin Detection Tool functions as a mechanism for alerting mark markers to potentially high levels of AI generated content but is not a substitute for academic judgement and AI detection reports alone are not used to penalise students.
Does the university have a formal policy on student use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Copilot)?
If so, please provide a copy or a link to the document.
Response: Student policies can be found on our website here: https://www.bbk.ac.uk/professional-services/registry-services/student-policies-2024-25 Specific AI policy is here: https://www.bbk.ac.uk/downloads/registry/student-policies-2024-25/ai_guidance.pdf 6.
What guidance or training is provided to academic staff on identifying and addressing AI-related cheating?

I am requesting information regarding the due diligence process for donations the university receives.
As stated in the âPhilanthropic gift acceptance policyâ all donations over Â£100k and Â£1m are subject to a due diligence report.
Can you please provide the following information: â¢  How many reports were carries out in the years 2022-23, 2023-24.
â¢  How much the donations were for.
â¢  Whether the university accepted the donation/ total number of donations accepted â¢  Any minutes for the committee meetings regarding said reports.
â¢  Please provide the names of any external providers doing due diligence reports on behalf of the university.
Response: Due diligence reports are carried out prior to the solicitation of a gift or pledge of value over Â£100,000 (or prior to accepting an unsolicited gift or pledge).
The gift acceptance committee considers whether it is appropriate for the University to accept the proposed gift.
The donor is then approached and may decide to donate or not (so not all gift acceptance committee approvals result in a gift being received or pledged).
Where a due diligence report has been carried out and the gift acceptance committee approved the solicitation or gift, further gifts may be received until the scheduled review of the due diligence report three years after the initial decision by the gift acceptance committee.
In 2022-23, 13 due diligence reports were carried out, 12 were approved by the committee.
There were 7 resulting gifts or pledges.
In 2023-24, 10 due diligence reports were carried out, all of which were approved by the committee.
There were 6 resulting gifts or pledges.
No external providers were engaged to carried out the due diligence reports.
Gift Acceptance Committee minutes are not publicly available as these are commercially sensitive.

Details of the closure and its impact on student services: Students were unable to access the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) during this period, which hindered their ability to adequately prepare for exams.
Additionally, information regarding exam dates was unclear, with some exams postponed.
Students were unable to access Birkbeck email accounts or any web-based services during this time.
I would like to understand the reasons behind this disruption.
Lack of access to Birkbeck's library services, forcing students to use Senate House Library as an alternative.
I would like to understand why the library was closed.
Response: The outage resulted in significant issues with connectivity and the operation of our IT systems from the weekend of 27/28 July, rather than 20 July, as your email suggests.
Response: Students were informed of the issues via SMS text message and email to personal accounts, where these details were available to the College, as a matter of urgency.
Whilst priority was given to restoring services, unfortunately the College was not able to support onsite studying and for this reason, students were asked not to attend campus for a short period of time.
Students were sent correspondence during the period of the outage and arrangements were put in place to rearrange exams and extend assessment and submission deadlines, to account for any disruption it could have caused.
The campus, including the library, reopened to students from the week commencing 5th August, although unfortunately it was only possible to provide reference access to the Birkbeck library until the libraryâs IT systems were restored.
Provision of services during the disruption: I request access to any relevant documents, such as email communication, circulars, meeting minutes, or executive communications, that pertain to the provision of services to students during the affected period.
This includes any decisions, discussions, or measures taken to mitigate the impact on students' ability to access educational resources and services.
Response: Attached are copies of emails and messages sent to students and staff during this time.
Request: I would like to understand the reasons behind this disruption.
Response: Poor password security from a single member of staff allowed an unauthorised user to access our network.
To mitigate risk to services and data we shut down system access and carefully brought services back on-line following detailed security checks.

I would like to know how much money the university paid to Athena Swan in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Response: For universities, the fee for participating in Athena Swan was Â£3,500 per membership year in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.
The fee increased to Â£3675 in 2023/24.
Advance HEâs membership year runs from 1st August to 31st July.
The membership fee includes all Athena Swan events and support, as well as the review of an institutional Athena Swan application.
In addition, we have paid: Â£500 per departmental application; and for bespoke consultancy related to Athena Swan.
I would like to know if the university pays annual membership to any Athena Swan schemes.
If yes, which schemes, how much money, and which date each year does membership run from/to.
Response: See above.
I would like to know who took the decision for it to be appropriate for the university to be under Athena Swan's influence, and on what basis this decision was taken.
Does the university plan to continue to give money to Athena Swan?
Are there any future plans to pay money to Athena Swan?
What are the university's commitments to Athena Swan in 2024?
Has the university undertaken any tasks at Athena Swan's request?
If yes, please list them and who approved them.
Response: Athena Swan is not an institution/organization.
The Athena Swan Charter is a framework used to support gender equality in Higher Education and Research.
It is managed by Advanced HE and members can apply for institutional and departmental awards to recognize their gender equality work.
Birkbeck has in the past applied for or held various departmental Athena Swan awards as well as an institutional award.
It is currently in the process of applying for an institutional Bronze award and awards for its three Faculties.
Athena Swan is a non-prescriptive framework and each member sets their own objectives based on their evidence base and local context.
The actions within Athena Swan action plans are not directed or prescribed by Advance HE.
Before applying for an award, each member commits to defining their local gender equality priorities with reference to the Athena Swan principles.
Each member works with their own institutional data to analyse their staff and students in relation to gender equality.
They will then develop a five-year action plan, based on their evidence and the objectives they wish to achieve.
This application is evaluated against the Athena Swan criteria by their peers in the sector.
Advance HE does not assess applications.
If an application has not addressed all the criteria for an award, a peer review panel may attach conditions to an award or request revisions to the application to ensure the criteria are fully addressed.
Ultimately, the decision to apply for the awards is made by Deans of the Faculties, and the Vice-Chancellor as head of the institution.
It is supported by the Head of Human Resources and the Chair of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee.
The decision is taken because it is in line with Birkbeck's commitment to gender equality and in the context of its wider equality and diversity work.
Please provide any emails, chat messages, documents and reports exchanged with Athena Swan in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
The majority of communications is standard information emails sent out to all institutions.

You asked if Birkbeck could share the breakdown of Birkbeckâs calculation of the rise in fees for the academic year 2024/25.
Response: The fees policy https://www.bbk.ac.uk/downloads/registry/student-policies-2023-24/fees-policy.pdf states the following with regard to inflationary fee increases: 4.
Annual increases and fee charging by cohort 4.1.
The College reserves the right to set appropriate tuition fees for its programmes and modules.
Any substantial changes to fees will normally come into effect for students starting a programme.
Where fees are changed for programmes or modules, students continuing on a programme of study will not be subject to the new fee, except where there are inflationary increases as outlined in paragraph 4.2 and 4.3.
4.2.
For programme enrolment courses students are charged an annual tuition fee in each year of their programme.
Following the first year of study, tuition fees may be subject to annual inflationary increases.
Regulated fees for home undergraduate students (see paragraph 2.1) will only increase to permitted maximums.
In all other circumstances, and for the duration of their programme, students may expect tuition fees to increase annually in line with inflation up to a maximum of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) +3%.
Birkbeck sets fees in the spring the year before the year of enrolment, so in this case, fees for 2024-25 were agreed in early June 2023.
This is to meet the deadline for publishing the prospectus for the coming year, including fees.
In May/June 2023, the latest data held on the CPI was the April 2023 figure, which was 8.7%.
The source used for this is the Office for National Statistics, here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/april2023 According to the fees policy, the maximum inflationary increase allowed was 8.7% + 3% = 11.7%.
You make the point that â at the point of re-enrolment in October 2024 - inflation will be lower than the 10% applied.
Because of the above timeline for publication of fees, there is a lag between increases in costs and the corresponding increase in fees.
This can work both ways, for example, in September 2022 CPI was 10.1% https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/september2022  In May/June 2021 when the fees were set for 2022-23 entry, CPI was 1.5%.
On this basis fees were increased by 2% for 2022-23 entry â yet at the point of enrolment inflation was considerably higher (10.1%).
Response: The fees policy https://www.bbk.ac.uk/downloads/registry/student-policies-2023-24/fees-policy.pdf states the following with regard to inflationary fee increases:
Annual increases and fee charging by cohort
4.1.
The source used for this is the Office for National Statistics, here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/april2023
According to the fees policy, the maximum inflationary increase allowed was 8.7% + 3% = 11.7%.

Along with your subject lecturers, learning development and study skills staff at Birkbeck are academic specialists - the methodologists of academia.
We are the equivalent of personal trainers for your studies, and our purpose is to help you optimise the quality of your work.
Learning development staff offer services in two main areas: developing your academic skillset and specialist technology to help you study.
Study skills are not personal qualities that students either do or don’t have; they are a skillset that can be learned and refined, and the fundamentals can be learned easily and quickly.
Engagement with our training and resources will help develop your existing abilities and serves as part of your lifelong continuing professional and personal development, offering you the best chances of success in your university studies.
Our workshops and resources cover a wide range of academic practice such as high-level reading and research skills, critical and independent thinking, writing essays, assignments and dissertations, and citation and referencing.
We cater for all levels of study and academic experience, from foundation to PhD, from experienced students to those coming back to university after a long time, or for the first time.
Technology has the power to transform the way you study.
You could try text-to-speech software to allow you to listen to your academic reading, plan your academic writing using mindmapping software, or use speech-to-text (dictation) software to get your first draft done.
Explore how you can use technology to tailor your learning to suit your preferences and needs.
