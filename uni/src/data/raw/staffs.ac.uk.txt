Graduates can also continue with their studies by taking our MA in Animation.
The Animation course is designed around the idea of a Dove-Tailed Curriculum.
This is an Innovative & Applied Learning approach where module content explicitly relates to other areas of learning in the Animation curriculum at all stages of progression and development.
In a way you could visualise it as three strands that are interconnected:
Because these all relate to each other, you are expected to attend all module sessions in order to benefit from the delivery and understanding of new material, gain understanding of module expectations and the related tasks.
Attendance is also important for you to engage in the regular peer-to-peer and tutor feedback.
Specific technical and software support and tuition will be delivered through timetabled sessions with the support of academic and Technical Support teams (dependant on class size and numbers) in support of your specialism pathway.
Through your specialism, you will plan and create responsive animation sequences that illustrate your understanding of the mechanics of character animation, staging and scenarios, as well as considering the media’s limitations and their unique capabilities in industry.
Integration of research, theory and practice .
Each module makes a link between understanding the contextual basis of each aspect of an animation production and its anticipated audience.
This assimilation of theoretical framework and skills-based learning supports a problem solving, applied and collaborative approach to study and life-long learning.
You will carry out theoretical research through independent and class-based study in a range of written and visual presentations alongside your studio practice.
There are no exams for this course – assessment is based entirely on coursework.
We find this is the best way to assess the integrated approach to research, theory and practice that you’ll engage in.
Your coursework, carried out in response to assignments, project briefs or self-initiated proposals, will be presented in forms appropriate to professional practice, such as visual sketchbooks, short animated sequences, word-processed reflective evaluations, preproduction material and production development documentation.
It may take the form of an essay or report.
Your approach to the coursework for a given module should be individual and distinctive.
Tutors see this work throughout its development thus forming a one-to-one professional working relationship with you throughout each production.
Formative assessment is carried out in tutorial and critique situations and feedback is usually provided to you orally, with an audio visual or written record kept either by the tutor and/or yourself.
This is sometimes produced as the result of peer- or self-assessment exercises.
As part of a tutorial process we call ‘Reflect.
Select.
Evolve.’ course staff will help ensure that you are focusing on the right specialism by looking back at your progression and development to date.
You will also look ahead to plan what medium to focus on in future modules in order to develop the focus your specialist skills.
This will usually take the form of individual tutorials with the relevant specialism Leader or Course Leader.
Although feedback is a constant process – the ‘Reflect.
Evolve.’ process officially happens at the end of each semester.
You will normally receive feedback on coursework assessments within 20 working days following the date of submission.
This usually takes the form of written or audio-visual documentation.
Your study time will consist of class contact hours, self-directed learning, assessment and placements where appropriate.
Your actual contact hours will depend on the subject area, on the option modules you select and professional body requirements.
Typically, this will involve utilising a range of digital resources including our virtual learning environment; reading journals, articles and books; working on individual and group projects; undertaking research in the library; preparing coursework assignments and presentations, and preparing for examinations.
All of our academic staff love animation and are passionate about sharing their many years of industry experience.
In fact, many of them are current professionals or active researchers working within Animation, moving image and performance related areas.
You’ll join an exciting and creative community – where we pride ourselves on creating a professional and commercial studio environment in which our students can flourish.

As environmental management has moved into the 21st century the traditional idea that managing the natural world is about returning damaged ecological systems to their prior state has become more controversial.This module will build upon this changing emphasis and will consider more flexible adaptive approaches to managing ecosystems.
These will be built upon the firm underpinning that humans and their activity are also part of the natural world.
Some material with focus upon preventing further damage but the emphasis will be a sustainable incorporation of society and ecosystem.The key thread will be the incorporation of conservation based ideas into sustainable and equitable frameworks.
Not only in the proximate urban setting but at the planetary level.
Well planned and integrated ¿greenspace¿ have the potential for providing areas of high biodiversity they may also deliver highly useful environmental goods and services, including coping with a diverse range of problems ranging from drainage and pollution, coping with food and water security, all the way to improvements in both physical and mental health.The module aims to provide you with an insight into the variety of ways the landscape may be managed and utilised when trying to provide a more collective stewardship of our environment.
As such it will cover a wide range of traditionally disparate disciplines ranging from the biological and biophysical components through to the human factors, both positive and negative, that contribute to this area of study.Integral collaborative work alongside professionals will strengthen your knowledge and employability of real world 21st century conservation projects.

Head Of Department - Nursing & Midwifery
I am currently the Interim Head of Department for Midwifery and Allied Health and Biological and Biomedical Science (Practice) and Lead Midwife for Education (LME) at Staffordshire University.
I'm a senior lecturer on the Midwifery programme.
I'm module leader for the level 6 evidence base for practice, where I get to explore research and how it is integrated into Midwifery practice and I lead the level 4 Universal care module.
The School will fund uniforms, occupational health screening and DBS services.
Some students may choose to take an elective placement outside of our standard Practice Learning Placement circuit.
Where this is the case, the costs associated with travel, accommodation, insurance etc will be the responsibility of individual students.
INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS ONLY
International Students, like all others, should be aware of the additional costs they will incur of travelling to their Practice Learning Placements (which constitutes fifty per cent of the course over three years).
This is in addition to the costs associated with studying away from home such as accommodation.
International Students are unlikely to be eligible for the additional financial support offered to some UK/EU students.
The International tuition fee includes a contribution to the yearly Practice Learning Placement tariff which will allow students to access the full range of clinical learning experiences.
Having an academic mentor as a Student Midwife is something that's really important because you can reach out to them no matter what.
And you know, you can also have that kind of close relationship that if anything's wrong, then they're always there to help.
Charlie France
Midwifery student
Going into clinical placement after doing the simulations really prepared me, because it's quite intense and fast paced out there.
So having that little bit of knowledge and background before I went out has been really useful.
Lisa Rhodes
There's a really good combination of academic to practical skills.
Obviously, you need to be able to do the academic side, but being able to practically replicate what you've learned from a textbook and then be able to do it in practice, both in the skills lab and then when you're out in placement helps every type of learner.
Helen Bailey
I'm on the Committee for the Midwifery Society.
Our role is to bring together the cohorts and try and arrange educational events or teambuilding exercises and to help build those relationships between the cohorts.
So, a first year might still be finding their feet and they might be worried about things that I think are normal.
But they've got the opportunity to talk to the second and third years.
Frances O'Malley
The facilities are really good.
We have everything we need here.
Most recently we've been doing obstetric emergencies.
It's really good to be in an environment where it's sort of real, but it's not real.
We can make mistakes.
We get feedback on that and we can improve going forward.

¿Contemporary Issues in Criminology and Criminal Justice will consider and explore core pertinent issues that are emerging at present and which shape the contours of criminal justice and crime, both as academic subjects, but also as systems of regulation that touch on human lives in the criminal justice system.
Academic criminology, if it has any value, must not simply be an abstract discipline but one which offers well considered, well understood critique and intervention based on the array of cogent empirical subjects which inform it, and offer solutions, critique and commentary that is relevant to both policy and praxis.
This module seeks to empower participants to do just that.
It begins with an extremely comprehensive introduction to some core aspects of contemporary criminal justice providers.
Crime, disorder, and justice are increasingly pressing concerns across the globe.
Fear of crime and proliferating global threats contribute to an increasing sense of insecurity.
Local concerns for example violent street crime such as moped muggings or acid attacks are now accompanied by twenty-first century global concerns about human trafficking, cyber-crime, terrorism and human rights violations to name but a few.
These threats have implications for justice, as the boundaries between crime control and civil liberties are being increasingly redrawn, with this in mind, the second part of the module moves to consider some of the most pertinent issues that are often presented as the crime threats to contemporary criminal justice.
The module culminates in assessment that seeks to encourage students to think about how types of crime impact on the former (Criminal Justice agencies) as they independently research and explore in detail key contemporary debates in criminal justice policy and practice (within their historical, social and political context) relating one of the crime areas to the contemporary criminal justice providers, considering the real world changes and challenges to criminal justice today that this nexus creates.
It therefore offers an advanced understanding of the criminal justice system, as well as the individuals and groups making up the system, particularly offenders, victims and the public that is relevant to the debates of today and builds across the universities eight learning outcomes equipping participants to be the criminological commentators and practitioners of the future.
Module code: SOCY70542
The module takes traditional and contemporary areas of criminological debate and seeks to facilitate students engagement with these theoretical paradigms.
Students will have to show higher level knowledge and understanding of the contours of contemporary criminology and its theoretical proponents.

The key criminological concepts covered on the module include:¿ Classical Criminology, Positivist Criminology, Interactionist and Critical Criminology, Feminist Criminology, Cultural Criminology and Deviant Leisure, Ultra-Realism, Social Harm, The Global South, Green Criminology, Life Course Criminology and Desistance Studies, Big Data and Administrative Criminology.¿ ¿ The lectures/seminars are set around themes and issues that deal with emergent topics and fields of interest, and the studied perspectives are clearly linked and do cross over.
However, during the module, students will deal not only with theory, but consider emergent areas and topics that are at the centre of criminology, which will be combined with discussion of emerging cases and examples.
These will include:¿ Terrorism and domestic extremism, homicide, borders and immigration, human trafficking, global warming, gangs and youth crime, wildlife crime, environmental harms, COVID-19, financial crimes, and a range of street crimes.¿

Therefore, it is important that students have a good understanding of research methods and their application in the professional world of social work.
The aim of this module is to give students a working knowledge of the main paradigms and methods of social scientific research; in addition to understanding the reasons why research must be ethical and transparent.
The module affords students the opportunity of completing their own research project, whereby, students can challenge themselves and develop their skills of data gathering, analysis and critical thinking.
The topic for the research project is decided by the student and therefore it is something the student can own, enjoy and from which the student gains substantial academic, organisational and personal achievement.

The UK climate is notorious for being dull, cold and rainy but it is actually very warm compared to what it could be.
The Gulf Stream helps keep the British Isles warmer than other countries located at a similar latitude in the winter with daily winter temperatures in England rarely dipping below 0° C (32° F) and more commonly sitting between 1° and 6°C (34°-43° F).
Of course, our summers are also fairly mild with average summer temperatures between 11° and 20° C (53°-69° F)
While the temperatures are generally comfortable, we do sometimes have cold fronts or heat waves that take us by surprise and the polar front jet stream can make British weather especially difficult to predict.
You may have heard some rumors about weather in the UK.
The UK has a reputation for being a cold, rainy and gloomy country but is it really true?
Whenever you come to a new country it can be difficult to know what to expect from the weather and what you should bring in order to keep yourself comfortable.
Is it really always rainy?
Well...
kind of, but maybe not how you expect.
While it is often rainy, the rain is normally not very heavy.
We don't regularly have big thunderstorms that shake the earth and cause floods (though they do happen) and more often than not, the days will be cloudy with light rain.
That doesn't mean it's never sunny!
It just means that it's not always sunny and we really appreciate the sunshine when it's here.
You might also be surprised to know that contrary to what you see in some films, it doesn't snow very often in most parts of England.
Every year we can expect some snow which may affect transport and allow you to have a snowball fight or build a snowman, but as the temperatures are normally above 0°C (32°F) the snow doesn't normally last very long.
One thing that we do have more of than some other countries is hail.
This is when little balls of ice fall from the sky, sometimes accompanied by a thunderstorm.
Hail storms come and go very quickly and are normally a surprise to everyone.
In the UK we have four seasons which come with changes in temperature and weather.
Again, the weather in the UK can be both mild and unpredictable so just because we say weather for a given season is typical, you can still have snow in May or sun in December.
Spring is from March to May.
Spring is normally cool and gets gradually warmer and sunnier as the weeks past.
In March and April you can expect a lot of rain with the weather getting sunnier as the days get longer.
Any gardeners will appreciate the beautiful spring flowers as they start to bloom.
If you are going out walking in Spring, make sure to be prepared for rain with layers you can remove in case it gets warm.
Summer lasts from June to August and is normally the warmest and sunniest season.
That being said, while there are normally several days above 27°C (81°F) every summer, we never know how many we will get or whether they will come in June or August.
For this reason, Brits celebrate a warm day whenever possible by going to the beach or sitting at the pub.
You will notice, however, that most Brits are not comfortable in weather above 21°C and might complain about the heat.
Because it doesn't get very hot very often, most buildings do not have air-conditioning or "aircon" so it can get very warm and humid if you need to be inside on a hot day.
Another thing to note about British summer is that the days are very long.
In the height of summer, it will still be light at 9 or even 10pm so it's perfect for sitting outside and having a chat with friends.
Autumn is the UK lasts from September to November and it is the time days start to get shorter and cooler.
Autumn can be very unpredictable with some October days feeling like the middle of summer and others feeling like the winter has already come.
Whilst going out in autumn can be a gamble(Will it rain?
Will it snow?
Will I get too warm?) it is well worth visiting any place with deciduous trees such as alder, beech and oak as these will change colours before shedding their leaves for winter.
Winter in the UK lasts from December through February.
As previously mentioned, it does not get as cold as many other countries but it does get very wet and windy which makes it seems colder than it is.
Winter is the rainiest season so you must always be prepared to stay dry when you leave the house and bundle up in hats, gloves and scarves to protect yourself from the bitter winds.
While it doesn't snow too often, it does snow at least a few times every year and you should be prepared with sturdy shoes for walking on ice.
Though it snows every year, the UK is not always well prepared for a storm so you should expect delays with public transport and local traffic on snowy days and leave plenty of time to safely get where you need to go.
Just as our summer days are very long, our winter days are very short.
For this reason, it is especially important to keep and eye on the mental health of you and those around you.
Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD is very common and nothing to be ashamed of.
If you feel like the poor weather(or anything else) is causing you to have a low mood, talk to your GP or the Wellbeing Team .
If you have not already completed online enrolment, we would encourage you to do this before you arrive.You will need to have the address of where you will be staying in the UK, even if it is only temporary.

Change the way you think to change the way you feel.
Improve wellbeing and performance under pressure
Providing strategies that can be employed by individuals beyond the programme for themselves and others
Possess more adaptive beliefs about stress and see the stressful events as a challenge rather than as a threat
The main premise of the intervention is to change the way in which individuals think, which in turn, adaptively influences their emotions and behaviours in respect of performing under pressure.
This begins with changing the way individuals think about stress.
Most people view stress in a solely negative way, but studies suggest that adopting a more balanced view of stress in general can be at the root of a range of helpful stress-related outcomes.
The intervention also uses strategies such as imagery, self-compassion and enhancing perceptions of control that individuals can utilise before, during and after stressful situations.
Importantly, the intervention has not only achieved beneficial results but has generated encouraging feedback by being rated as an enjoyable and engaging programme that individuals continue to benefit from beyond the intervention.
Workshops are designed specifically for your needs, so whether you're a sports coach to young athletes or a teacher at a school, we can teach techniques that can be used by all to better manage  the stresses of daily life and ultimately to improve our wellbeing.
An example activity is the 'Helpful Thinking' task which looks at how individuals feel immediately before and after a bad result.
Following this, individuals select three of the thoughts they wrote and give advice to a friend to think in a more helpful way, if they were to have those thoughts.
This provides individuals the tools to make their own helpful thinking cues.

A podcast that explores how individuals connected to sport are able to perform under pressure.
We interview athletes from a variety of sports, sport psychologists, coaches and more to provide a variety of perspectives on coping under pressure, strategies that are effective immediately prior to performance and how they react adaptively to mistakes.
Sports psychology academics from University of Staffordshire have found that teaching athletes simple cognitive behavioural techniques can change their ‘stress mindset’ and, in turn, enhance their wellbeing and performance.
My impression of the sessions were very positive.
Watching the content of the sessions being delivered I thought that the students were able to engage and relate to the feelings that were discussed when revising for exams and would be able to recognise stressful situations and turn any negative feelings into positive feelings which would hopefully provide a successful outcome.
I also noticed how the students were also able to apply these techniques not only to exam preparation but also in day to day stressful situations.
It has also allowed the students to look at situations in a different way and change their mind-set, instead of worrying about the uncontrollable factors they are able to focus on the factors that are within their control and ensure they do everything they can to prepare to the best of their ability.
I personally feel as though I also benefitted from these sessions as it also persuaded me to take a look at the way I look at stressful situations and focus on the controllable factors.
I also liked the way in which we were told to visualise things going right instead of going wrong and perhaps using some vocal cues to help trigger a positive mind-set and a positive way of thinking.
Going forward I think that this is beneficial to not only students but also people of all ages.
It wasn’t until I got into working life that I realised that your frame of mind and psychology in sport plays a huge part in the probable outcome.
Preparing our students for their exams can be a stressful time for and I think that successful revision sessions coupled with the intervention that yourself and Jason conduct will help them to give them the best possible chance of a successful result.

This statement, made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, constitutes the University’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement setting out the steps that University of Staffordshire has taken to combat modern slavery in our supply chain.
We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking.
The University of Staffordshire’s core business is teaching and research in the Higher Education sector.
It has a student population of approximately 10,000 in a wide range of subject areas, comprising academic schools and an Institute supported by professional services.
In 2022/23 the University employed around 1,500 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff with a mix of full time and part time academic, administrative, technical and support staff.
The University had an annual turnover of £168 million (2022/23) of which c£60 million was spent on goods and services to support the running of the University.
There has been a planned capital expenditure programme of c£53m over recent years to improve student facilities, with further developments planned in the coming years.
The University has a centralised procurement and contracting function supporting procurement activity, with purchasing devolved down to individual schools and functions.
Our supply chain includes many diverse suppliers, including providers of goods, services and works that directly support research and teaching activity, for example, student computer equipment, library services including books and online services, and suppliers of goods and services not directly related to these activities such as estate maintenance.
Our requirements are from several categories which have been identified as ‘high risk’ in terms of the potential for slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and human trafficking.
These include, but are not limited, to:
Our initial targets in relation to Modern Slavery were as follows:
Many of our suppliers in these higher-risk categories have committed to the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and the UK Universities Purchasing Consortia are working to persuade the remaining suppliers in these categories to join them.
The ETI Base Code is founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is an internationally recognised code of labour practice.
As a user of a variety of external framework contracts we continue to work closely with our locally based procurement consortium, the North Western Universities Purchasing Consortium (NWUPC), to manage risk through contract management processes.
We have embedded our commitment to compliance with the Modern Slavery Act within our Sustainable Procurement Policy.
This policy provides guidance on how we deliver all our procurement activity.
We have embedded consideration of the Modern Slavery Act in our procurement process from the Standard Selection Questionnaire and Invitation to Tender documents through to contract management.
We request Modern Slavery statements for organisations over the £36 million threshold.
For expenditure in high-risk categories, we ask how the company addresses compliance to the Modern Slavery Act as well as supplementary questions to ensure compliance.
We have embedded our commitment to all members of staff within University Policies that include Equality, Diversity, Health and Wellbeing and Bullying and Harassment.
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking.
Any supplier or potential supplier who does not adhere to these values or is found not to be compliant will be suspended and removed from the University supplier list and will not be considered for future supply unless and until they are able to demonstrate full compliance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act.
In 2019 we launched a supplier development toolkit to support our suppliers on a range of sustainability issues, including Modern Slavery.
The following details have been drawn from the tool and will be used to support and shape supplier development on Modern Slavery.
Analysis of the 418 suppliers registered to the toolkit as suppliers to University of Staffordshire:
Further analysis of those of our suppliers who have committed to action on Modern Slavery shows:
Develop a robust approach to removing Modern Slavery from their supply chains :
Provide Modern Slavery training for Staff:
Modern slavery risk analysis:
We shall continue to increase awareness and support our suppliers to actively respond to the challenges of Modern Slavery.

Welcome to our Academic Quality and Development (AQD) website, which has been designed to ensure that you can find all the resources, toolkits, advice and guidance that you need, to deliver the next generation courses, student experience and signature pedagogies we are known for at University of Staffordshire.
Our AQD teams have been established to support course design, development and delivery, digital pedagogy, education research and evaluation, quality enhancement, student and graduate employability as well as a range of academic projects that enhance student engagement.
AQD supports all staff to ensure that we deliver a high-quality student experience improving outcomes for all students at Staffs.
The services we provide are organised through our five departments:
The Academic Development Team empowers academics, and supports Schools and Institutions to deliver inclusive, and innovative educational opportunities that meet the changing needs of our modern university.
As a team we are able to provide expert advice in the following areas:
Head of Department: Sam Dent
The Academic Projects department has two main strands of work.
The first focuses on increasing student engagement and improving the student experience through curricula and co-curricular activities.
We design and deliver activities that use evidence-based approaches, for Welcome Week, Induction and Learning and Teaching.
We co-lead the Student Manifesto Project with the Student Union, lead the Staffordshire E.D.G.E enrichment programme and the deployment of learner analytics to re-engage students through hyper-personalised interventions.
The second strand of our work focuses on curriculum management via the New Course Approval Process and through procurement of curriculum management software.
Student Engagement Project and Toolkit
This project is exploring the theory of student engagement in higher education and identifying evidence-based activities to enhance student engagement across the student journey.
the Academic Projects department is working in partnership with schools to develop a toolkit of resources and activities for university staff to use with students before they arrive, during Welcome Week and Induction and beyond.
The Toolkit aims to help staff:
Student Manifesto Project
In March 2022 the UPP Foundation released their findings on what students needed from their universities post-pandemic.
The recommendations from the research were that universities work in partnership with their students to co-create a Student Manifesto which outlines how and when they will support students to overcome the challenges they have encountered consequently.
University of Staffordshire has welcomed this, and the Students’ Union are working with AQD, academic and student support colleagues on six strands of work including transition, lost learning, wellbeing and mental health, teaching and learning strategies, employability and enterprise development and graduate outcomes.
Staffordshire EDGE.
Activities have clear learning outcomes and wherever possible are embedded into curricula, attracting different points dependent on their level.
Activities within and across themes can be stacked together allowing students to be awarded Bronze, Silver or Gold when they accumulate enough points.
Some activities earn badges that can be added to CVs (for example Microsoft Digital Badges).
Students holding the top five highest number of points at the end of the year are rewarded with vouchers.

Meeting the APP targets: Getting to Know your Students and equality of outcomes for all
Working closely with the Education Research and Evaluation (EREV) team, we are building a learner analytic which uses multiple measures of attendance and engagement to enable us to identify students who are at risk of dis-engaging and not achieving as well as they might.
Over time this will be built into a predictive analytic which uses multiple data streams to predict engagement and attainment allowing the university to intervene and drastically improve student outcomes.
In tandem with this the EREV team are building a measure of education gain.
All of these measures will be available in dashboards to academic mentors and course teams, helping them to recognise when, where and how to intervene.
These measures will help the Academic Projects department evaluate the efficacy of its own projects, building a resource base of ‘what works’ at Staffordshire.
Curriculum Management: From Conceptualisation through to publication
We are regenerating the complete course conceptualisation through to publication process to improve the universities course portfolio and enable courses to be created, validated and published in an efficient and effective manner.
It is overseen by a team of key staff to ensure that at any given point we can identify where a course is and how to move it forward.
Initial phases of conceptualisation (owned by schools) and executive approval precede design sprints and validation (supported by our Quality team).
Courses then move through a series of steps which Academic Projects oversee, managing the workflow from team to team: curriculum build, web structure building, admissions and marketing, before students are able to apply.
The above NCP process is a temporary measure to improve the efficiency of course design and publication until a Curriculum Management System is procured and set up.
Academic Projects is currently reviewing provision from three providers before writing a business case and beginning the processes of refining university wide requirements for the system and initiating implementation.
Micro-credentials in partnership with TILE and Digital Pedagogies
University of Staffordshire has developed a framework for the delivery of micro-credentials from Summer 2023.

Our new TDI platform will be used for the delivery and assessment of all micro-credentials.

Sustainable Cities and Communities
The policy provides an overview to illustrate how the University will meet its aim to actively manage student and staff related travel associated with the University.
It highlights the need for increased awareness of the impact of business travel and commuting to the University and our carbon reduction commitments.
This policy is to clarify the variety of different aspects and impacts of student and staff travel within the university, how these are both managed and minimised where possible and to reflect the commitments set out in the University's Environmental Sustainability Policy and the University’s Strategic Plan.
University of Staffordshire is a multi-campus and multi-site University, our Stoke on Trent campus is within the 2 miles of the larger towns within the Stoke area and is exposed to significant road traffic, which can impact on the efficiency of car and bus travel in the area.
The campus is located less than half a mile of the railway station, but with limited local services, a number of students and staff are not able to utilise this service, limited bus services within the Stoke area, also reduce the ability of students to use public transport to commute to the University.
The policy aims to encourage more active and environmentally friendly decisions when making transport choices.
It also seeks to assist the surrounding communities, local authorities and the global impact by reducing traffic congestion and the associated harmful effects on the environment from single car usage and higher carbon emitting modes of travel.
It is widely understood that whilst travel and transport can have a negative impact on the environment, through carbon emissions and reducing air quality in the local area, we need to enable students and staff to travel to our campus for teaching.
By providing adequate information on alternative travel options to encourage behaviour change we can reduce these environmental impacts, without compromising the student experience on campus.
Measuring and monitoring the carbon emissions associated with travel will enable the University to report on carbon emissions and demonstrate reductions in carbon emissions through changes in travel behaviour.
While developed countries such as the UK have relatively advanced alternative travel and transport options at a national level, locally this remains a challenge, due a wide range of personal requirements in relation to travel.
As a university, we must remain aware of the level of resource consumption and ensure that is managed is a sustainable way, within the scope of our responsibility.
This will assist with the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The University has made a commitment to reduce the impact of our operational travel, and in 2023 created an electrified fleet for maintenance and estates vehicles.
This is aligned to the creation of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure on both our Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford campus.
Estates and Commercial Services will move from the use of diesel to petrol vehicles, in preparation for the government legislation of ceasing the production of combustion engine vehicles from 2030.
Accurate and robust reporting of carbon emissions from across the University in relation to business mileage will be created, using data from a variety of sources, including:
By effectively managing offsite business travel, encouraging multi-occupancy vehicles and utilising shared vehicles, we can reduce the impacts of these critical business trips.
We will review the operational effectiveness of using hire vehicles for business rated trips and journeys, to reduce environmental impacts and reduce the reliance on a potentially aging grey fleet of vehicles.
Low carbon travel options when booking travel will be encouraged and this will move to a mandatory requirement.
Encouraging the use of alternative commuting methods, reducing single occupancy cars and continuing to allow a flexible hybrid working pattern, carbon associated with staff commuting can be reduced.
Staff can use the electric vehicle charging infrastructure whilst on campus, at a competitive rate, to encourage the use of electric vehicles.
The University offers and publicises discounted public transport options, which will continue.
We will continue to use annual staff surveys to record commuting behaviours and carbon associated within these journeys.
Our parking provision and the approval of parking permits will remain limited to staff located more than two miles from our campuses, to encourage the use of alternative transport methods and encourage more active travel options.
Encouraging the use of alternative commuting methods and reducing single occupancy cars for student commuting aims to reduce carbon emissions, however the University is aware of the other demands placed on students who are reliant on their cars and would not look to detriment any student through the restriction of car use.
Students can use the electric vehicle charging infrastructure whilst on campus, at a competitive rate, to encourage the use of electric vehicles.
The University offers and publicises discounted public transport tickets, including local buses and national rail services which will continue.
The University provides free inter-site travel for students between transport hubs and our campus, to reduce the requirement for students and staff to bring cars on to campus, not only reducing the environmental impacts, but the financial burden placed on students in relation to travel.
Our parking provision and the approval of parking permits will remain limited to students located more than two miles from our campuses, to encourage the use of alternative transport methods and encourage more active travel options.
In line with the University’s International Policy, carbon associated with international travel, the University will continue to recruit a certain proportion of international students to our taught and research programmes as we believe that they bring diversity to the life and work of our University, to the local communities in which our campuses are located and to the regions to which we contribute.
We will encourage international students to minimise the number of flights they take during the course of their studies.
We will continue to develop international collaborative academic partnerships in key regions, including the possibility of exchange of students for periods of study between the University and the partner (in both directions).
We will minimise the amount of incidental travel associated with management of these relationships and will use digital means of communication where possible.
We do recognise that, to maintain good relationships with partners, a certain amount of travel will be needed.
We will support our students in their aspirations to live, study and work abroad, and will encourage them to minimise the number of flights taken and to prioritise rail travel over air travel within Europe.
We will develop a hybrid approach to the delivery of some of our programmes, including digital and on-line learning, which will allow us to expand our international education offering in a less carbon intensive manner.
We will support our research academics to pursue collaborative research projects with overseas partners and will encourage them to minimise the number of flights taken and to prioritise rail travel over air travel within Europe.
We will work within potential carbon budgets for travel which may be imposed by funders.
In the event of the University being subject to external carbon emission ‘budgets restrictions’, we will analyse the cost/benefit of international academic activities when deciding how much carbon to allocate to these activities.
By effectively managing and reporting on the environment impacts of business-related travel, we will aim to reduce the financial impacts on the university through these essential journeys.
We will review and interrogate the journeys which are taken, and the travel mode chosen, to encourage the use of public transport and discourage single occupancy journeys.
A cost versus carbon analysis of journeys will be undertaken, to demonstrate the comparable savings which can be made through alternative travel options.
University of Staffordshire is committed to:
Nigel Peake, Head of Strategic Sustainable Procurement
12 Responsible Consumption and Production
This Sustainable Procurement Policy has been developed to ensure that all staff involved in the procurement of goods and services within the University routinely consider how we can enhance and protect our shared environment, contribute to the health and well-being of society and build a sustainable economy through our procurement decisions.
This policy outlines the following:
The Policy has been developed alongside, and is aligned to, the University’s objectives and values.
Sustainable procurement to University of Staffordshire means routinely considering the environmental, social (including equality) and economic opportunities and impacts of purchasing decisions, whilst at the same time considering a long-term view.
Given the range and scale of sustainability issues which are potentially relevant to University of Staffordshire, the Sustainable Procurement Policy has identified six priority issues which will be considered in all procurement decisions and which Procurement will promote to devolved departments (and other decision-makers) who have delegated authority to make certain purchases.
The issues have been prioritised because they make a significant contribution environmentally, socially and economically to the University, our key stakeholders, our suppliers and the local community.
As well as the consideration of these priorities in our procurement processes, we will ensure that a risk-based approach is used to identify and to manage any significant environmental, social and economic considerations which are unique to any individual product or service procured by the University.
Key to success in implementing this policy and delivering progress against the six priority issues will be to work in collaboration with the University’s suppliers.
The University has already the NetPositives tool which provides a focus for collaboration with suppliers.
The six priority issues are:
For each of the priorities we have identified why it is a priority for the University and detailed some specific considerations.
Minimise the use of non-renewable and limited natural resources in our procurement choices and throughout our supply chain
People and communities are reliant on a readily available supply of limited natural resources to sustain life itself – water being a perfect example.
There is pressure on many of these resources caused by increased consumption, resource-hungry manufacturing processes and inefficient use.
A commitment to optimising the use of these vital resources is a pre-requisite for any socially responsible institution.
Where appropriate we will purchase from suppliers who subscribe to scheme and standards that demonstrate these principles, e.g., Soil Association
Effectively reduce and manage waste in the supply chain
It is widely recognised that the cost of waste management and disposal will continue to rise.
It is also recognised by the University that any sort of waste, whether or not it can be recycled, is in itself contrary to the principles of sustainability.
By effectively managing the production and flows of waste within our supply chain we can save money and reduce the negative environmental and social issues associated with waste.
Effectively manage the delivery of goods and services to the University
The University is a major employer.
In the place where we live it is important that we consider the environmental and health related issues, such as air quality, associated with transporting our goods and services.
Support the management of our carbon impact.
The integration of the consideration of carbon into our procurement processes is essential if we are to meet our stated carbon targets, and we will work with our colleagues to achieve this.
Work with our suppliers and with University colleagues to raise awareness of sustainability in building a more sustainable economy
As a large local employer with a wide-ranging supply chain, we can have a significant positive impact environmentally, socially and economically.
Whilst value for money is a key part of our Procurement Strategy, we also understand that a sustainable supply chain will help us deliver excellence for the University and support the local economy.
Ensure that ethical considerations such as Fairtrade, Modern Slavery and anti-bribery are fundamental to our procurement practices.
Social and ethical considerations are an important part of our social responsibility as a high-profile employer and purchaser.
Working with our supply chain, we make decisions for the benefit of individuals and communities locally and globally.
We have identified the following statements of action which are relevant to this Sustainable Procurement Policy.
It is through delivering these statements of action that we will ensure the effective delivery of our Sustainable Procurement Policy.
There are three key guiding principles which will support the effective delivery of the Sustainable Procurement Policy.
We will ensure these principles are embedded into Procurement thinking and action.
In developing this Sustainable Consumption Policy, the University is aiming to support its catering outlets by providing customers with a more sustainable and ethical experience.
This policy applies to all University catering outlets on all sites including Stoke, Centre for Health Innovation at Stafford and University of Staffordshire London.
The policy provides an overview to illustrate how the University will meet its aim to actively manage waste produced on site, through the reduction of waste produced and a focus on increasing re-use and recycling on site.
It highlights the need for increased awareness of waste management across the University and creates focus actions areas.
This policy is to clarify the variety of different aspects and requirements of waste management that takes place at the University and to reflect the commitments set out in the University's Environmental Sustainability Policy and the University’s Strategic Plan.
University of Staffordshire generated 563 tonnes of waste per year in 2022 (not including construction related waste), equivalent to 0.05 tonnes per FTE staff and student.
The environmental impact of waste and waste management is well documented, and the University has a duty and responsibility to correct manage and minimise waste it generates.
It is widely understood that waste and recycling is a key concern of students and staff at the university, as this an aspect of their personal environmental impact which they can directly affect.
By providing adequate recycling and waste provisions across the University’s sites, to encourage behaviour change and increase recycling rates on campus, we can directly tackle environmental issues and demonstrate the University’s commitment to being more environmentally friendly.
While developed countries such as the UK have relatively good waste management practices, recent events have exposed the interconnected nature of global waste markets, and the reliance on developing countries as a destination for recyclable waste.
Meanwhile unsustainable levels of resource consumption and disposal threaten the ability of the world to manage its resources in a way which is both in keeping with the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and which prevents far-reaching and lasting effects on global ecosystems, in particular the oceans.
By managing waste effectively on our campuses, we can reduce the financial burden on the university presented by disposing of waste.
There are wider financial implications associated with transportation and storage of waste, as well as purchasing consumables and other resources.
A move to a more sustainable model of resource management would look to increase efficiency and hope to drive innovation.
The University has a legal responsibility to ensure that any waste removed from the University premises is stored, transported and disposed of without harming the environment.
This is called the 'Duty of Care'.
Part of the Duty of Care is a commitment to the principles of the ‘waste hierarchy’.
Managing waste in accordance with best practice ensures a reduction in the likelihood of enforcement-related costs or fines to the University, as well as associated reputational damage.
ensuring compliance with all relevant legislation and regulations associated with our activities, and where possible, to exceed requirements.
establishing waste related objectives and targets and report on progress annually
applying the Waste Hierarchy when making decisions.
7 Affordable and Clean Energy
University of Staffordshire is committed to proactive energy management measures which, in addition to meeting all legal requirements and approved codes of practice, aim to aim to minimise energy wastage and optimise the use of low carbon and renewable energy sources.
This policy aims to direct how energy is managed and monitored at the University, how wastage is kept to a minimum and how the use of low carbon and renewable technologies can be optimised at the University.
This policy reflects the commitments set out in the University's Environmental Policy.
University of Staffordshire is committed to:
Comply with all relevant legal and legislative requirements relating to energy use, consumption and efficiency.
Monitor and report on energy consumption and carbon emissions.
Identify areas of significant energy use at the University in order to set appropriate objectives, targets and action plans designed to reduce energy waste.
Support the purchase of energy efficient products and services as outlined in the Sustainable Purchasing Policy.

Optimise the procurement and generation of energy from low carbon and renewable sources.
Minimise the energy used in conditioning the internal building environment, whilst maintaining workplace temperatures at a reasonable level.
When carrying out refurbishment programmes to properties, improve the fabric of the building, as well as introducing other energy savings mechanisms.
Take a ‘fabric first’ approach to all new builds and look at other technical solutions to create low carbon buildings, in line with the Sustainable Construction policy.
Where the University occupies property managed by third parties, ensure that the supplier is aware of university policies.
Work with the operators of those properties to achieve the same standards as would be expected if the property were managed by the University.
6 Clean Water and Sanitation
The University’s objectives for water management are to:
Ensure that the University’s water supply is managed appropriately.
Ensure that wastewater is handled appropriately.
Reduce water consumption within health and safety guidelines.
This policy applies to all University sites including the Centre for Health Innovation, Stafford and University of Staffordshire London.
Where the water supply is provided through a management arrangement with a third party, the University will work with the third party to achieve the same outcomes.
Water supply and waste will be managed in line with the University’s statutory obligations which include the University’s compliance with the provision of a healthy water supply including regular testing and reporting.
This area of compliance is overseen by the University’s Health and Safety Committee and reported to the Board of Governors via Sustainability and Resources Committee.
The University will work with the water supplier to ensure that all water supplies are metered and monitored accurately.
There will be a process for identifying, communicating, managing and repairing leaks as soon as they occur.
Plumbed in drinking water supplies will be provided within all University buildings,
The University will introduce mechanical and digital methods to reduce water usage.
Reducing and managing water consumption and waste will be considered as part of all refurbishments and new build projects.
The University will work with students, staff and visitors to reduce consumption through awareness of water usage.
In order to reduce health and safety risks, and the threat of damage to property, we will ensure that rainwater is managed appropriately through groundworks and water management systems including swales and water features.
Catherine Fleming, Head of Facilities Management and Projects
The policy is to clarify that sustainable construction guidelines will be adhered to during the development of new buildings and major refurbishment works.
Each project will be considered individually, in the context of factors such as site-specific characteristics and building function, as well as emerging technologies, construction methods and materials.
However, all new projects will target industry-leading energy performance standards and implement recommended methodology to increase accuracy of predicted performance in design and minimise performance gap in operation.
Take a fabric first approach, focussing on the use of high-quality materials and construction methods to reduce energy consumption.
For New Buildings - any new construction project or campus development:
For Major building refurbishments:
15 Life on Land, 13 Climate Action
Biological diversity is the variety of life on Earth (plants and animals) at the ecosystem, species and genetic levels.
Biodiversity is essential for healthy ecosystem functioning and is directly valuable to human society for economic and cultural reasons.
Biodiversity is declining worldwide and must be conserved and enhanced to provide a sound basis for human survival and progress.
Given our commitment to teaching and learning and research in the environmental sciences, our commitment to the communities who live and work near our campuses and with campuses containing significant biodiversity resources, University of Staffordshire will take a lead in promoting biodiversity conservation and improvement on its own estate, and more widely, wherever possible.
The policy aims to protect and where possible enhance local biodiversity within the management of the existing estate, as well as a new development.
Ensure compliance with statutory biodiversity obligations and alignment with other University policies.
Protect and enhance biodiversity on the University estate by the application of environmentally friendly management techniques.
Avoid or limit the use of environmentally damaging substances, materials and processes, e.g., by minimising the use of pesticides.
Plant native herbs, shrubs and trees wherever possible and provide habitat and corridors for animals, e.g., nesting sites, ‘bug hotels’, pollinator plants etc.
Take into account biodiversity needs, including pollution prevention, in investments, procurement, planning and design, new-build and construction, servicing of equipment and maintenance of buildings and outdoor spaces.
Create new greenspace where possible and ensure ecological connectivity both on campus and by linking to the external green space network to our spaces.
Use biodiversity to promote healthy living and well-being through enhancement and use of species-rich outdoor amenity areas.
Minimise the impacts of university functioning and developments on biodiversity, by consideration of alternatives, applying mitigation measures and compensating for modifying effects.
Raise awareness of biodiversity conservation internally among staff and students in order to mainstream biodiversity thinking in decision-making at all levels.
Integrate education on our relationship to biodiversity (or more broadly our place within nature/sustainable actions) within the curriculum
Understand the relationship between the University’s Climate Changes Response and Risk Management Policy and biodiversity
Communicate the University’s work in this area to external audiences so as to raise and enhance the University’s profile, with benefits for public image, professional esteem and student recruitment, as well as providing a positive inspiring example of acting on the moral imperative.

The project is due for completion in time for the student intake in September 2026
Professor Martin Jones, Vice-Chancellor
The project is by Staffordshire Campus Living, a joint venture partnership between University of Staffordshire, HOCHTIEF PPP Solutions (HOCHTIEF) and investor Plenary.
Built by Willmott Dixon and designed by Corstorphine & Wright, the village hub has reached its highest point in construction.
When complete it will include accessible and low energy study spaces, social and welfare facilities as well as student accommodation services over four levels.
Work has also started on the residential phases of the development which includes 700 new build student bedrooms in cluster blocks and town houses, as well as the refurbishment of a further 300 bedrooms of existing student accommodation.
A new footbridge and boardwalk across the River Trent will link the new student village to the University’s current student campus and the full project delivery is targeted for completion in time for the student intake in September 2026.
HOCHTIEF was awarded the contract twelve months ago by University of Staffordshire to design, build, finance and operate the student village and Willmott Dixon has made swift progress on delivery to date.
At the topping out event a plaque was presented by Chris White, Construction Manager for Willmott Dixon to Professor Martin Jones, Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of University of Staffordshire.
Professor Jones said: “With sustainability and well-being at its heart, the student village will provide more than high-quality accommodation — it will create a vibrant campus community where students can connect, grow and achieve their best.
“It is incredibly exciting to see the project’s progress and we can’t wait to welcome students into the student village when it is completed next year.”
Speaking on behalf of the Staffordshire Campus Living consortium, Ian Prescott, managing director of HOCHTIEF PPP Solutions UK and Ireland added: “We are very proud to reach this first significant milestone just twelve months since being awarded the contract by University of Staffordshire.
We have developed a low energy and low carbon solution for the entire village, ensuring sustainability and carbon reduction are at the heart of the design, build and operation, in line with the University’s carbon neutral targets for 2030.
We’re looking forward to seeing the village hub and student accommodation used and enjoyed by students next Autumn term.”
Paul Crowe, CEO of Plenary Group said: “We are excited to be collaborating with the University and the other project partners on our first UK project.
I’ve seen first hand the strong progress that has been made and look forward to seeing that good work continue as the project team works towards realising the University’s vision.”
Dan Doyle, Operations Director from Willmott Dixon added: “Topping out of the village hub marks a proud milestone on a project that’s already creating a lasting legacy, not just for  University of Staffordshire, but for the wider community of Stoke-on-Trent.
The village hub, and the wider student village development, are supporting local jobs, enriching lives, providing work experience opportunities for local young people and are ultimately strengthening connections between the University and the people of Stoke-on-Trent.
We’re incredibly proud of the positive impact this project is already having, and will continue to have, for years to come.”

Rowan is set to inspire the next wave of game creators as a college lecturer
Rowan Simpson,  BSc (Hons) Games Design with Animation
Rowan has had a fascination with animation since he was a child and pursued this passion on the BSc (Hons) Games Design with Animation course at University of Staffordshire.
The 24-year-old from Coventry reflected: “I remember specifically watching Jason the Argonauts with my dad, and thinking “this is awesome – how do I do that?”.
And now I can look back at that moment and be proud to say that I can do that.”
University of Staffordshire is home to the largest games department in the UK, with strong links to industry and opportunities for students to put their skills into practice through collaborative projects and placement schemes.
Students also have access to industry-standard facilities, including a high-tech Vicon motion capture studio and a specialist games centre featuring the Unreal games engine.
Plus a VR and mixed reality lab, with green screens and wall projections.
“There is something different around every corner of the Staffs experience,” Rowan explained.
“I was encouraged by my friends and lecturers to go beyond where I thought I could go.
And I was encouraged to be me and to explore my creativity in my own way.
“During my time here, I have used motion capture to transform my friend’s sister into a giant fire breathing lizard monster.
I have created a deep delve into 14th century medieval sword fighting and I’ve voiced acted a cockney dragon in a fantasy game!”
Alongside his studies, Rowan had a part-time role as a student demonstrator and helped to showcase games courses at the University to school and college pupils.
This experience inspired a love of teaching in Rowan and, after graduating with a first class degree, he has secured a job as a games design lecturer at his local college.
“My experience in my student demonstrator role really impacted that.
It allowed me to be introduced to the world of games education.
I want to thank my lecturers Ben and Amir who really guided me through that and inspired me to want to be a lecturer.
“Staffs encourages you to not just sit and write essays – they want you to take the theory and actually make games.
I’ve been able to transfer that into real life and into my next job.”
Rowan added: “For anyone interested in studying Games, Animation, 3D Art, I would 100% recommend University of Staffordshire.
I’ve loved my time here!”

I am a lecturer in scenography, and my background is in set and costume design for theatre, opera, interactive installations, exhibitions, and socially engaged arts practices.
My design work has been funded by national bodies (including Arts Council England, and Heritage Lottery Fund), includes UKRI research projects, and ranges from small scale fringe theatre, touring, outdoor, and children’s theatre, to large scale intergenerational community projects by international companies.
I’m also an experienced facilitator / leader for primary and secondary students, intergenerational community groups, Theatre in Education, and socially engaged community / professional partnerships.
My love of live performance began as a 6 year old, watching my local amateur dramatic society perform in the wonderful Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, North Yorkshire.
I performed all through my childhood and teenage years, and undertook an undergraduate degree in Drama and Theatre Studies with a 4 th year specialism in Design for Performance.
I entered the industry as a designer straight after graduating, and worked my way up from fringe and low budget theatre.
My interests have always teetered between the design side, and the performance / directing side of making work.
In my early career I forged several paths – one rooted very much in designing set and costumes in a fairly traditional way; another exploring more experimental approaches to ensemble and collaborative performance-making; and another within socially engaged community work and Theatre in Education contexts.
I worked for schools, community groups, Theatre in Education companies, and the Government-led creative learning programme ‘Creative Partnerships’.
After nearly a decade of professional practice I pursued an MA in Ensemble Theatre, to more formally develop myself as a scenographer within an ensemble practice.
I continued my industry work upon graduation, and then sought more time and space to examine my own practice through a practice-based PhD in Scenography.
More recently I have developed my HE teaching, enjoying working with non-designers in the exploration and implementation of scenographic thinking and practices within collaborative processes.

This module addresses how diverse the photographic process has been and continues to be in the formation of an 'image world'.
Photography is primarily utilised in the formation of 'mass produced' imagery that contributes fundamentally to how things and ideas are distributed and consumed through the media.
In addition to these industry usages, photographs have been made in order to persuade, to reveal and to evidence our relationship to the world and to each other.
You will be asked to reflect upon some of these relationships and possibilities in the making and consideration of photographic work.
Through practice-based workshops and tutorials you will be involved with the strategic concerns that a particular practice/s requires.
"The ability to interpret, critique, create, and use visual communication on sophisticated levels".
(Williams, Newton, Visual Communication: Integrating Media, Art and Science) are the working methods being explored in this module.Producing photographs means that we also consider some of the questions, debates and issues that have raged around the medium of photography, its nature and purpose, since its invention.
Is it art, or merely a mechanical recording device?
Is it objective and scientific, coolly analytical, or is it an emotionally charged trigger to subjective memory and contemplation?
What is photography for?
How do we make sense of photographs?
Through a series of lectures, you will learn to relate your developing practice to a body of theories, ideas, thoughts, and strategic approaches.
Module code: PHOT50659
Specifically in Semester 1 you will learn through a series of seminars and presentations foregrounding photo practitioners, theories, and processes relevant to contemporary practice.You will be asked to chart your developing awareness of these ideas, methodologies and technical skill sets through an online research document.

Individual Practice1: Explorations is a practice-based module of photographic work and related research that will contribute to and define the framework for the production and implementation of work for a Degree Show made in the Individual Practice 2: Consolidations module in Semester 2.Levels Four and Five of the Photography award have provided opportunities for you to practise different kinds of photographing and to amass a considerable range of technical skills.
The making of photographs has been related to visual communication throughout the award and the importance of critical thinking emphasised as crucial to your intellectual development and understanding.
As you enter Level Six it is expected that you will have professional and/or personal ambitions for your photographic interests.
This module provides the opportunity for you to explore and develop those areas of particular interest and to refine your skills further.
Each student proposes an area of practical and research study that can demonstrate and expand upon the knowledge and experience gained in previous studies.
Every student's programme of study is mentored and evaluated individually through constant discussion and feedback between the student, your peers and supervising tutor/s.As part of this area of study the essay asks that an informed critical perspective be fully considered in relationship to a chosen theme, issue, or question.
This may or may not be related to your practical work for the module.
The emphasis is on formulating a critical perspective rather than a survey or purely descriptive piece of writing, providing a structured and coherent analysis supported by properly referenced (Harvard) visual and textual sources.
Like the practice-based work supervisory feedback is structured throughout the module.
It is expected that this writing will expand understanding of photographic practice/s and practitioners beyond what you are familiar with, through rigorous visual and text-based research pertaining to the concerns identified.
The essay should provide an informed and well-researched work fully supported by carefully selected and properly captioned illustrations.
The essay must be to a high academic standard including a bibliography and using Harvard Style referencing throughout.
Module code: PHOT60661

New sentences found on https://staffs.ac.uk/features/ma-ceramics-students-work-with-lucideon:
MA Ceramics students Amy Swift, Matt Whiting, Lily Collins, & Dr Jill Bunce have worked with local materials science consultancy Lucideon to incorporate a new ultra-high temperature ceramic material in the centenary ceremonial mace they have designed for Stoke-on-Trent.
This is the first time that a piece of this material at this scale has been produced in the UK.
These types of materials are typically used in aerospace for the leading edges of hypersonic vehicles and re-entry spacecraft due to their thermal stability.
MA Ceramics student Amy Swift, 32, discussed how using a local company with a future-facing material speaks to the heritage and innovation of the city.
“The inclusion of this experimental material and a company focused wholly on the future of ceramics has meant that the mace now represents the past, present and future of ceramics in this city.
We have allowed them to lead the way on telling us what was possible as this was not an area any of us felt we had enough knowledge with to take charge.
However, working closely with my team we came to the decision of the central 'bowl' in the design, a space cushioned either side by the past.” The opportunity to design the Stoke-on-Trent mace (sponsored by Ceramics UK ) was born from The Fenton Mace project previously undertaken by both undergraduate and postgraduate students at University of Staffordshire and facilitated by Professor Neil Brownsword.
The team of creatives from the MA Ceramics course have different specialties, and their design proposal was seen as something to champion the whole city.
Amy attributes this thoughtful design to considering how best to represent the local area.
“We focused on the people of Stoke-On-Trent as well as the industries that crafted the city into what it is today.
As the mace represents the city and its people, we felt it was important to include them in the design at every opportunity.
I reached out the Scouts organisation and they in turn sent out the request to their troops for the children to hand draw a five-pointed star (a symbol that represents the five fingers of the working man) and decorate that star however they wish.
These stars will be part of the decoration on the mace body itself, taking the future generations of Stoke-On-Trent with the mace's journey through time.” Dr Jill Bunce, 76, a descendant of former artists that worked in the pottery industry, has worked with Lucideon on another project - researching new materials and the use of them in modern ceramics.
She adds, “the Stoke mace design has been inspirational to work with as the team wanted to set the design in meaningful symbolism for the centenary and the geography and the history of Stoke and the industries which have formed the identity of Stoke on Trent .
The team wanted to set the mace in a modern context of materials and to look to the future in concepts in the developing industries based on the ceramics industry and the artistry and knowledge within the ceramics industry.”
Matt Whiting, 32, who progressed onto MA Ceramics at University of Staffordshire following undergraduate study on BA (Hons) Product, Furniture, Ceramics, worked on the mace design and production with a combination of digital and traditional skills.
“My focus has been the surface pattern and digital aspects of the mace, as well as some of the practical elements such as glazing.
A combination of CAD, Adobe, 3D printing, laser cutting, and digital ceramic prints were used for the creation and fabrication of the mace.
It has been interesting to use these skills for a conception of a ceramic object as it’s very different to how I usually work as a maker.
We’ve incorporated modern technologies and processes as well as more traditional ones into the design and making process of an object that represents the long history of ceramics in Stoke-on-Trent, and hopefully its bright future.”
In addition to working with a local Scout troop and Lucideon, the group of postgraduate Ceramics students have benefitted from generous contributions from a number of local companies for the additional materials incorporated into the design and the expert guidance of the University of Staffordshire technical team.
“ C J Skelhorne is providing the precious metals for the design, we are currently figuring out the best way to incorporate the metals from a practical and cost-effective mindset.
KMF provided the inner threaded core that forms the basis of the entire construction of the mace.
Valentine Clays has provided the heritage Staffordshire Bone China that forms the most iconic and integral design aspect of the mace.
Profab are constructing the steel, rebar stand that represents the heritage of the steel industry.
Burleigh have provided ceramics we are able to use to supplement the historical shards we are using in the handle that represents the ceramic past and heritage,” Amy Swift.
AJ Phillpot & Sons have provided oak for the stand upon which the steel and rebar sit.
The Stoke-on-Trent Centennial Mace will be sworn into regalia in November this year and used to close the centenary celebrations in December, before being housed with the rest of the city's regalia for the foreseeable future.
The bowl has been made through a process designed at Lucideon, where parts from advanced ceramics can be gel casted.
The process includes:

Senior Lecturer Angela Devoti recently curated a special exhibition of vintage fashion from The Betty Smithers Design Collection archive in collaboration with the charity, Callister Trust and The Williamson Art Gallery in Birkenhead Liverpool to commemorate the centenary anniversary of Callister Garden (now Callister Trust).
The Callister Trust is a charity, established in 1925, promoting the welfare of girls and young women in Birkenhead, the garden also has links with the Suffrage Movement.
The garden fell in to disrepair but has recently been taken over by the Callister Trust who are developing it as a retreat in its original vision but including others such as asylum groups.
The trust is continually fundraising towards a new pavilion being designed by Architecture students from Liverpool John Moore’s University.
University of Staffordshire were approached to support the charity in a fundraising event and an exhibition was designed and curated by Senior Lecturer Angela Devoti.
The exhibition took place in The Williamson Art Gallery, showcasing specially selected garments and accessories from The Betty Smithers Design Collection, from the University of Staffordshire to celebrate many of the key moments of women’s fashion from every decade of Callister Gardens history, beginning from the 1920s to the present day.
‘‘Each of the outfits on display around the Williamson Gallery presented the ongoing transience and temporal nature of fashion reflecting the continual changes within society, culture and politics.
The garments and accessories hold the lived bodily experience, signifying moments in time, revealing varying narratives, telling their own unique story, which ultimately form a collective inspirational statement of liberation and freedom of expression.’’ Angela Devoti, Senior Lecturer BA (Hons) Fashion and Course Leader for Foundation Year in Art and Design at University of Staffordshire In addition to the public exhibition, a series of walking lectures and handling talks centered on the pieces from The Betty Smithers Design Collection were arranged by Angela and also took place at The Williamson Art Gallery.
These were highly engaging and very well received by those who participated.
‘‘The lectures and handling talks about the Betty Smithers Design Collection exhibition allowed the visitors to encounter and share in their own memories of fashion and this experience fostered some incredible thought-provoking narratives about memory, place and time told through dress.’’
Cathy Warren, Chairperson for the Callister Trust commented "We were delighted to collaborate with the University of Staffordshire on our first event to celebrate the centenary of Birkenhead based charity, the Callister Trust.
The pop-up exhibition of items from the Betty Smithers Design Collection at the Williamson Art Gallery alongside our 'Roots of Fashion' vintage show and auction enhanced and deepened the project.
Lectures by Angela Devoti, curator of the exhibition, engaged visitors in sharing memories and experience of nearly a century of fashion."
Samantha Howes, Venue Manager from The Williamson Gallery added "The collaboration between the Callister Garden and the Betty Smithers Design Collection at the University of Staffordshire has been a joy and inspirational for the gallery.
It has demonstrated the links between fashion, the environment, and its impact upon women."

A University of Staffordshire academic has been recognised in His Majesty the King’s Birthday Honours for his outstanding contribution to the NHS and biomedical science education.
Ian Davies, Associate Professor of Biomedical Science Practice at University of Staffordshire, has been awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) for services to the NHS Diagnostic Pathology Service and to Biomedical Science Education.
Before moving into academia full-time in 2015, Ian spent over two decades in the NHS, where he led clinical chemistry services and played a key role in workforce development and service transformation.
He has since become a leading national figure in biomedical science education, known for driving innovation and championing collaboration between the NHS and universities.
His work has included leading on degree apprenticeships, embedding simulation and interprofessional learning into biomedical science programmes, and supporting national COVID-19 testing training with NHS England.
A strong advocate for patient-focused education, Ian is committed to building a diverse and highly skilled scientific workforce equipped to tackle today’s healthcare challenges and tomorrow’s innovations.
In 2023, Ian was named Biomedical Scientist of the Year for his pioneering work on degree apprenticeships – a programme he leads at the university which is helping develop apprentices from more than 25 NHS Trusts.
Ian said: “I’m honoured and completely humbled by this recognition.
It reflects not just my work, but the incredible support and collaboration of a fantastic team around me and leaders who’ve had the faith to back me over the years.
I’m proud to play a small part in shaping the future of biomedical science and the real privilege is working with such inspiring colleagues, students and graduates who continue to push boundaries every day.”
University of Staffordshire Vice-Chancellor Professor Martin Jones praised Ian’s wide-reaching impact: “Ian has built a powerful national network and reputation over the last decade, and he consistently uses this platform to spotlight others – from NHS partners to our own students and graduates.
He is a trusted voice within his profession and a fantastic ambassador for University of Staffordshire and biomedical science.”
Mike Phillips, Executive Dean of the School of Health, Education, Policing and Sciences, added: “Ian is an outstanding academic whose work has had a transformative impact on both education and clinical practice.
He has an unwavering passion for supporting learners and developing a future-facing scientific workforce.
This recognition is truly well deserved.”
The King’s Birthday Honours list celebrates individuals across the UK for their extraordinary service and contributions to public life.

On Friday 17 February 2023 Visitor Attraction and Resort Management (VARM) students attended Francis Jackson’s final strategy presentation.
This event is always a much anticipated event by the students in their second year of study.
However, this would be the last presentation by Francis Jackson, General Manager at Alton Towers Resort.
This was an extraordinary opportunity for VARM students past and present to learn more about Alton Towers' strategic positioning and Merlin Entertainments product portfolio.
From the global brands that Alton Towers has, ranging from LegoLand to CBeebies Land, to their own strengthened brands such as Wickerman and Smiler, Alton Towers has shown huge growth within the visitor attraction industry over the last 40+ years.
The talk entailed Francis’s journey and how he made opportunities happen, why short decisions are part of their long-term strategy and how we can better ourselves within the visitor attraction industry.
Francis especially mentioned the 'five whys', detailing to students why strategic decisions are made, what impact they have on the business, employee culture and how to improve this in line with their strategy.
This was all mentioned in addition to the impact of the pandemic on Merlin Entertainments streamlined strategy and the speed of implementation.
At the end of the presentation, myself, Alex Parsons and Jake Price presented Francis with a hand-created piece of art drawn by Jake, on behalf of all years to commemorate the VARM partnership.
From the current students of VARM we would collectively like to thank Francis for everything he has done at the resort and wish him all the best for the future.
And we would especially like to thank Kirsty Holland and Tonia Barret for organising the event.

Students Billy, Aden, Callum and Jess share their experience of creating their own resort as part of the module.
We developed a 'fun-cational' resort theme park called Howard Castle Resort.
The idea was based on guests going on a journey through time, with lands and attractions based on Vikings, the medieval era, and old vintage funfair, and a futuristic steampunk land, all with unique attractions such as Paradox, a dark ride based on a time machine.
In this module, we learned about marketing and how brand identity is something that is highly valuable to a company.
We looked at how certain colours convey very different emotions - we then used purple in our resort logo to identify the rich history and luxury of the Greystoke Castle in Cumbria, where our attraction would be based.
Along with being creative, as a group we understood the importance of making sure our attraction was highly accessible so that anyone who visited could have a fantastic experience.
We developed concepts such as a sensory bag, with items such as park-specific communication cards and sensory-friendly toys and much more, which was proudly one of many projects we delivered in our presentation to the Alton Towers 'dragons'.
During this module, everyone in our group had different roles during the development of the attraction and during the presentation.
These roles varied from hotels, food and beverage director to accessibility director, operations and marketing director, and my role in human resources and guest excellence.
Alongside working together, we created fantastic informative booklets which we presented to the 'dragons' and were then used as supporting appendices for our assignment.
So, it reached presentation day on that Friday morning, nerves were high and 'dragons' arrived, and then the main presentation began.
We first explained our mission, our competitors, and external factors that may affect the business, and there was a lot of anticipation of who from Alton Towers was coming to watch us present our project.
Our presentation started with a quick game for them from our PESTLE table.
Following this, each member of the group had individual workshops and the dragons were split into groups, and each member of the Howard Castle team presented our ideas, explained and gave out fudge until we all finished and answered many challenging questions given to us by the dragons.
Ultimately, this was a challenging yet highly rewarding project which led to all students on the Visitor Attraction and Resort Management course being impressed with one another.
The experience and new connections as a result of working on this project will ultimately help us in their future.

They are also looking forward to their Vehicle Principles and Professional Development lectures and getting into the Automotive Workshop.
Final year students have been starting to develop their final proposals for the Engineering Project module, there’s some exciting projects around the Formula Student car design as well as looking at battery technology and sensors in vehicles.
Foundation students have been learning about engineering principles and getting practical experience with the labs, as well as having specialist lectures on automotive powertrains so that they can start to build on this once they’re in their second year.
Track day and aerodynamics lab sessions Our second year students have all participated in a track day experience this year, replicating the “arrive and drive” concept – they plan the whole event, making sure that the transport meets specifications, that the track car is prepared and set up and then each gets the opportunity to be a passenger for several hot laps, gathering vehicle data that they can then analyse back in the workshop.
They’ve also just completed their laboratory sessions for aerodynamics , exploring the effect of streamlining on the drag produced by an object.
Formula Student team members on our Student Connect Podcast Automotive and Motorsport and Formula Student team members Angel and Alex joined our student-led podcast to talk all things Formula Student and their experience making lifelong friendships, networking with teams from around the world, and festival vibes racing at Silverstone on our award-winning Staffordshire Racing team.

New sentences found on https://staffs.ac.uk/features/aeronautical-student-nokwanda-on-being-a-woman-in-stem:
I remember applying to study at Staffordshire University and praying that at least one other girl would take this course too so that I would not feel alone.
However, when I met my friends, they told me that they thought they would be the only girl on the course too, and we laughed about it.
This is a common thought that women feel when applying to Engineering degrees.
In one of my engineering classes, I noticed only three other women in a class of around fifty.
It was at that moment, that I remembered how outnumbered we were.
Rather than deterring me, this realisation instilled a sense of pride, as I remembered advice from Kari-Anee Clayton, a speaker at a Women in TEC event I attended.
We must create the best version of ourselves with what we have, to do this we must focus on ourselves and never compare our journeys with those of others.
By focusing on our strengths and skills, can we contribute effectively.
Staffs Uni has always made me feel welcome when it comes to being a woman in an underrepresented area.
I made a circle of friends both women and men and we have supported each other throughout the years.
As I reflect on this, I thank them for the memories including the hardships that we have gone through together as engineering is hard but with the right people, it can be such an enjoyable experience.
There are many services such as the Career Connect Hub staff who are always willing to support students through university and job applications.
They give us information on job roles, networking events and workshops.
I also like that the Woman in Stem Society was set up by students, as it gives women the chance to meet their peers, network and support each other.
Most STEM degrees are male-dominated, which can be very intimidating so societies such as this one are so helpful to women who want to follow their passion.
Although it is intimidating to study a male-dominated degree, I advise any woman who has a passion for a STEM degree to try things that are outside of their comfort zone.
This allows us to be heard and give differing perspectives which are important within any industry.
If you hear a little voice in your mind telling you that you are out of place or not qualified (Which is not true), then you are probably doing something right as every opportunity is a learning experience, so we should give it a go and do our best.
There are positives and challenges to pursuing a STEM career, but a strong network means that we can support each other through the challenges and help each other succeed within our education and job roles.
My favourite lecturer was Emily Raeburn , a mathematician, who taught us engineering mathematics.
Her ability to break down complex topics and teach us how to apply them to real-world scenarios was amazing.
Almost every student who studied with her agreed that she was an amazing teacher and commended her style of teaching as the reason why they got high grades in the subject.
To finish off, by empowering women in STEM, we unlock the full potential of human ingenuity and creativity.
This allows us to create inclusive and equal solutions to the problems that we currently face as a society.
Let us create an environment where the contributions of women are valued and respected.
And stop discrimination, skepticism, and doubt.

Students in the Engineering department at Staffordshire expand their learning on educational and inspiring trips.
Last month, Mechanical Engineering and Automotive and Motorsport Engineering students took an exclusive tour of the Mini Plant in Oxford.
Whilst final year Aeronautical Engineering students went to Cranfield and were passengers aboard their Saab 340 flying testbed aircraft.
2nd Year Mechanical Engineering student Alexios found it helpful to observe how the car manufacturing industry works.
“The Mini plant in Oxford was amazing, I was really fascinated by all the robots that they used in the spot welding section of the factory (the one that they assemble the whole body of the car).
I had seen a lot of photos from car manufacturing lines online but seeing it in person was something different”
Final year student Michael also found the trip helpful.
“Watching the robotics on such a large scale was fascinating.
It helped me to underscore some of the theories in modules such as Manufacturing Technologies, Manufacturing Systems & Quality, and Automation & Control Engineering.
It also highlights how humans and technology can interact on a large scale production plant.”
Vinesh, a final year Aeronautical Engineering student participated in the testflight aboard the Saab 340 flying testbed.
“The Cranfield trip was an exciting one.
We saw how the plane could handle different altitudes and speeds.
It brings the whole class together and it also allows us to see for of the practical side.
Seeing all the theory in person helps to connect that knowledge and the thoughts that we have.” Vinesh added “My favourite part has to be where the pilot pitched the nose down quite fast.
You like flew up in the air for 10 seconds!
That was great fun.
We knew it was coming, but it was still surprising.”
John, also in his final year of Aeronautical Engineering also found the plane banking from side to side the most exciting part of the trip “it's not something you're going to forget.
I mean, I can't believe, literally a week ago now, I was probably up in the air.”

Dr Mark McKenna's fourth book, Big Wednesday: Lamenting Lost Youth in the New Hollywood
We're delighted to share that Dr Mark McKenna has published his fourth book, ’Big Wednesday: Lamenting Lost Youth in the New Hollywood’ with Routledge.
The monograph uses the divisive 1970s surf film Big Wednesday as a vehicle to interrogate some the founding principles of film, media and cultural studies, considering issues of discourse, authorship, genre, stardom and commerce and how they each impacted on the film’s reception and rehabilitation.
Described in peer review as an “impressively wide-ranging, carefully researched and engagingly written study of an oft neglected movie classic.
In addition to an illuminating analysis of Big Wednesday and of the film’s making, marketing and reception, the book offers a compelling account of the importance and evolution of surf culture, and a wealth of new insights into the careers of its maverick writer-director, John Milius, and its three leading men.
All this is presented with detailed references to key debates in Film Studies and to significant trends in Hollywood cinema since the 1960s.”
Dr McKenna has said that he was “keen to develop a book that engaged with the core aspects of the discipline, but that presented these ideas in an interesting and accessible way to student’s interested in understanding how debates in the discipline have developed and evolved over time”.
Following a successful book launch at Dr McKenna’s alma mater, the University of Sunderland, in November, he will be presenting his work at a range of conferences in the coming months and integrating these new findings into his undergraduate teaching at University of Staffordshire.

Dr McKenna in Rocky's Philadelphia
“Sometimes research is just ...
well...
fun!
And this first part of my BA/Leverhulme funded project on Stardom in the Post Studio Era has been very enjoyable." Dr Mark McKenna, Associate Professor of Film and Media Industries at University of Staffordshire describes the research project.
"The project examines the role of star brand narratives and how those narratives influence the popular perception of particular stars, as well as the agency of the stars in that process.
Using Sylvester Stallone as a case study, the project seeks to challenge the widespread belief that film stars achieved autonomy with the decline of the Hollywood studio system from the 1960s onwards.
And to do this, the project contrasts an audience research study with fans of Stallone, with archival research to be conducted next year at the Margaret Herrick Library, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California."
"The project is divided into two, testing Richard Dyer's thesis that stardom is both a phenomenon of production and a phenomenon of consumption.
My visit to Philadelphia was to explore the idea of consumption and to try and understand what fans get from visiting the famous 'Rocky Steps' and what they take from the inspirational parallels between the character and Sylvester Stallone's (studio-fabricated) biography.
As part of this visit, I got to run in the Rocky Run , a Rocky-branded half marathon that capitalizes on the pilgrimage fans continue to make to those iconic steps, almost 50 years after the film's release."
"It was great to see thousands of people descend onto Philadelphia to run in the ‘Rocky Run’ and to talk to them about what inspired them to make that journey, but it’s important to recognise that the narrative that they are responding too, is a studio construction that cast Stallone as a working class everyman and from which he has continued to benefit”.
McKenna adds that scrutiny of these kinds of narratives is a fundamental part of what he teaches here at Staffs, and that it’s important to understand the value that narratives of this kind continue to have in the marketplace.
“In a period where working class voices are increasingly being marginalised in the creative industries, it is significant to see a star benefiting from his perceived underdog origins."
What's next for Dr McKenna's research?
“It’s a really exciting time for me and my work.
The first part of the study has just been accepted for publication with The Velvet Light Trap, one of the most prestigious film journals in the world, and the book that will be the culmination of this project has been contracted with Edinburgh University Press.
Next year will see me visit the archives of the Margaret Herrick Library - the main repository of print, graphic and research materials of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles.

Dr Agata Lulkowska with their published work "Filmmaking in Academia"
We're delighted that our Film and Media Associate Professor Dr Agata Lulkowska has had her work ‘Filmmaking in Academia.
Practice Research for Filmmakers’ published by Routledge Focus.
The monograph fills a visible gap in literature addressing the how-to of creative practice research, here, more specifically, in filmmaking.
The book emerged out of necessity.
"I have been supporting many filmmaking-based PhDs, as well as those based in other creative practices, and I realised that what is fundamentally missing is the consistency among the examiners, supervisors and institutional guidance.
Many early career researchers, but also experienced filmmakers coming to academia and pursuing their filmmaking as research, stumble across a messy environment which lacks clear guidance." Dr Lulkowska added "My passion for supporting others in achieving their (research and creative) potential made this book a very important personal project.
The book aims to help emerging and existing filmmakers-researcher to understand their filmmaking practice as research, and the way it functions within academia.
It directly links to my teaching at Staffs, and all the PhD candidates I support.
"
“It is often about gaining enough confidence that what you’re doing is not only worth it but can lead to incredibly creative solutions.
And there are so many ways in which film can be impactful and change people’s lives.
Learning craft and trade and nurturing your creative and storytelling techniques is what we do at Staffs, from UG to postgraduate levels.”
The book will have an online launch (via Zoom) on Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 4:00 PM, in conversation with Professor Erik Knudsen, a top expert and authority in filmmaking-based research.
It will be introduced by the Routledge editor, Emma Moore.

Dr Andrew Stubbs-Lacy - University of Staffordshire
We're delighted that Dr Andrew Stubbs-Lacy has had his work The Talent Management of Indie Authorship: From American independent cinema and short “films” to pay-TV and streaming published by Edinburgh University Press.
Through case studies such as the Coen brothers, Cary Fukunaga, and Spike Jonze, it explores the cultural, social, and industrial implications of screen authorship and auteur brands, and maps the careers of such figures in relation to screen media convergence as well as race, gender and class.
"As a longtime fan of American independent film and prestige television, I have long been fascinated by the people who are credited as the creators, who promotional materials and critics seductively describe as individual geniuses.
Understanding that screen media projects are created collaboratively and involve networks of people working within different industry conditions, I set out to demythologise the concept of the genius autonomous filmmaker, or indie auteur, by shedding light on the roles played by talent intermediaries - producers, talent agents, and talent managers - as they contribute to constructing their clients' and collaborators' brands to help sell a range screen media productions." "I love teaching at University of Staffordshire because every day I get to interact with students and colleagues who are as inquisitive as I am.
As someone who did his undergraduate BA at Staffs, I recall the passion that I had for independent film especially, and how my lecturers encouraged me to think more critically about the works that I enjoyed.
With this book, I hope to encourage readers to think more critically about the construction of individual brands and to better understand the interconnected nature of the screen media industries."
Dr Stubbs-Lacy's work is available to purchase here .
Dr Andrew Stubbs-Lacy A senior lecturer at the University of Staffordshire, Dr Andrew Stubbs-Lacy has always been very passionate about film and media and feels very fortunate to have a job where he can share that passion with others.
Dr Stubbs-Lacy has spent almost a decade researching the screen media industries with a focus on independent cinema, streaming, authorship, branding and talent management, and draws on his research to expand his students' understandings of these industries.
He loves the films of the Coen brothers, Richard Linklater and Ava DuVernay, as well as series such as Mad Men and The Wire , which his students know only too well!

I am a senior lecturer and Course Leader for Forensic Science.
I specialise in forensic chemistry, particularly forensic drug analysis.
One of the many things I loved about the Forensic Science course was having hands on experience of mock criminal investigations, from collecting a piece of evidence in the crime scene house to analysing it in the laboratory.
This meant I was able to use a number of biological, chemical and analytical techniques to obtain as much information from that evidence as possible, so I have graduated with great knowledge and practical experience.

To me, there was no place more rewarding.
In 2016 I graduated from Staffordshire University, qualified as an Operating Department Practitioner (ODP) and have been a registered member of the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) ever since.

BSc (Hons) Psychology
I applied for the Psychology degree with Foundation Year in 2019 with the attitude that this would be my “last roll of the career dice”.
At the age of 48 I believed that a lot of companies like to employ younger people - this is not always the case but I does not stop me from worrying about it.
My interview with Dr Claire Barlow went really well.
She had the ability to dilute my self-doubt and managed to assure me that if I worked hard enough I could achieve great things.
I came away from that interview feeling as though I could achieve anything as long as I applied myself.
I am now moving into my second year of study (level 4 at the University).
I am going into this year full of confidence and excitement, comfortable in the knowledge that I will be guided and supported throughout my degree.
Staffs Uni has given me a new sense of self-belief and I am very excited to see where this wonderful journey will take me.

New sentences found on https://staffs.ac.uk/features/my-placement-year-with-the-prison-advice-and-care-trust:
Forensic Psychology student Hana Bosworth helped to reunite prisoners with their families as part of her placement work.
She spent her placement year with the Prison Advice and Care Trust (Pact) and was based at HMP Gartree in Leicestershire.
As a student family engagement worker, she was involved in arranging family days for prisoners, creating activities for their children, doing casework and overseeing courses.
Hana also came up with a mood board so the children could express their feelings using superhero characters.
Her initiative proved so successful that it could now be used by Pact in other prisons across the country.
Going into a prison was nerve-wracking at first.
But she soon realised she was making a real difference to families’ lives.
The 21-year-old said: “I chose the placement because I wanted to see if that environment was one I wanted to work in.
It definitely is.
It opened my eyes and taught me a lot.”
Hana was supervised on the placement, but also had quite a lot of responsibility.
It included writing up reports from meetings, marking prisoners’ coursework and giving them certificates for passing the courses.
The most rewarding aspect was working with families.
“There was one prisoner who hadn’t seen his son for 20 years.
His son contacted us as he just wanted to know if his dad was there.
They were reconnected,” she said.
As a category B prison, Gartree has many prisoners serving life sentences.
They can struggle with family ties.
Hana added: “There are around 250 prisoners at Gartee who don’t get any visits at all.
It can be quite hard, especially when they want to reconnect and the family member doesn’t.
You have to tell them it’s not going to happen.”
But when families were reunited, prisoners were often grateful and thanked Hana for her efforts.
She would talk to them, call their relatives and help arrange the family days.
Activities included puppet shows and crafts.
Through donations, Pact also arranged for the children to get Christmas presents from their dads, uncles or grandads who were behind bars.
The placement has now inspired Hana’s career ambitions.
She hopes to become a psychologist in a prison, working on parole cases.
She said: “This year, we are doing a lot on prisoners on my course.
The placement has shown there are different sides.
Obviously, the prisoners had done some horrible things and you had to keep that in mind.
But they are just people at the end of the day.”
Hana’s work so impressed her manager at Pact that she has now won a national award.
She was presented with Pact’s Student Placement of the Year award at a ceremony attended by Princess Anne.

New sentences found on https://staffs.ac.uk/features/grandparent-special-guardians-lived-experiences:
Study by Dr Stacey Rose O’Sullivan-Hayes, Dr Yvonne Melia, and Dr Faiza Nazir.
Methods
Interviews with six grandmothers were used to create space for grandparent Special Guardians to share and reflect on their experiences.
Findings
Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), interviews identified five key themes that appeared particularly meaningful or common across those who took part.
The findings suggest that grandparent Special Guardians are navigating a complex role in the absence of support around them.
This can lead to or increase difficulties in relationships with their own children and can affect relationships and dynamics in the wider family.
Many grandparent Special Guardians had experienced social, emotional, relational and financial difficulties since taking on the role, supporting their grandchildren alongside managing these difficulties, often alone.
This can increase the likelihood of negative outcomes for themselves, their children, their grandchildren and the wider family.
Conclusions and implications
While grandparent Special Guardians are responsible for caring for their grandchildren under a Special Guardianship Order (SGO), local authorities (LAs) have a shared responsibility to provide families with relevant support.
The findings suggest that LAs are largely failing in their duty to do so.
Support with facilitating contact, trauma and attachment training, support around the family unit and respite opportunities could lead to more positive outcomes for such families and their wider relationships.

Aim
The aim of this study was to understand the support priorities of older (65+ years old) carers of people living with dementia.
Two nominal group technique focus groups were carried out with older carers of people living with dementia.
Twelve carers participated across two focus groups.
Participants individually identified support priorities, and through several steps, reached a consensus to produce a ranked list of support priorities.
The results consisted of two lists (one list per group), which when combined made up 15 support priorities.
These priorities are presented alongside their overall and mean ranking.
The authors did not refine these priorities after the focus groups, however, as there was overlap between priorities across the two lists the results benefited from being themed.
These overarching themes consisted of prioritising the carers’ holistic needs; having a sense of belonging; support needs to be accessible and timely; support to meet the wellbeing and personhood of the person living with dementia; and understanding and training for the wider community.
Conclusions
These results have highlighted support priorities, developed by older carers, that services and organisations can use to better inform the support and services that older carers receive.

Objective
The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of viewing body positive quotes on body satisfaction, body appreciation and self-objectification, in comparison with viewing body positive images or neutral stimulus amongst young women.
Method
A total of 179 participants took part in this current research, all of whom identified as female, aged 18–30.
Participants were randomly assigned to view body positive images (and captions), body positive quotes or neutral stimulus (nature scenes) and completed pre- and post-measurements of body satisfaction, body appreciation and self-objectification.
Results found that post-exposure state body satisfaction significantly increased in all groups, although there was not a significant difference in the magnitude of the increase between those who viewed body positive images, quotes or neutral stimulus.
There was a significant increase in body appreciation post exposure, and participants exposed to body positive images or quotes had a significant increase in body appreciation post exposure, with increases significantly higher than those exposed to neutral content.
Lastly, results suggest that no significant differences were ascertained in post-exposure self-objectification between those who viewed body positive images, quotes or neutral stimulus.
Interpretations and implications are discussed.

New sentences found on https://staffs.ac.uk/features/the-impact-of-relative-age-effects-on-psychosocial-development:
Background
Within the same school class, it is usual to find children who differ in age by almost a full calendar year.
Although associations between being relatively young and poor academic outcomes are well documented, and relatively consistent, the associations between being relatively young and psychosocial outcomes are less clearly documented.
Aims
To review research which presents data relating to associations between a child's relative age and their psychosocial development.
A systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.
Results
Fifty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria.
The outcomes of the narrative synthesis and three meta-analyses found consistent, but very small, associations with relative age indicating that those who are relatively young are more likely to have more negative behaviour, mental well-being, and social experiences.
Although being relatively young is associated with more negative psychosocial outcomes, the magnitude of these associations is consistently small.
Furthermore, many of the outcome measures used are likely to be the result of multiple influences, not limited to the effects of relative age.
Therefore, the findings are reassuring as they suggest that relative age itself is unlikely to substantially increase an individual's risk of poor psychosocial development.

I joined Staffordshire University in 1982 after completing my MSc in Semiconductor Physics and Technology at Brunel University.
Following that I obtained my PhD in Electronic Properties of Thin Films of Lead Phthalocyanine at Keele University.
In 2001 I left to take up the Chair of Professor of General Engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg.
In 2003 I returned to Staffordshire University to work as the Director of the Thin Films Laboratory.

Electrical and transport properties of thin films of organic semiconductors have extensively been investigated for device applications such as sensors, TFTs, OLEDs, and photovoltaic technology.
Applications of polymers in such devices prompted considerable interest amongst research communities.
Polymers can be synthesised with tailored physical and chemical properties increasing the number of potentially useful material for energy conversion.
Lower temperature requirements associated with fabrication techniques (spin coating, spray prolaysis and rolling) of this material reduces the cost of manufacturing, balancing poorer efficiencies resulting from lower carrier mobility, and problems associated with exciton dissociations.
Recent advances in material process and selection based on blend of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have shown promising photovoltaic efficiencies.
Amongst blended material, poly (3-Hexyl Thiophene) (P3HT) and Phenyl-C61-Butyric acid Methyl ester (PCBM) proved to be promising.
Since the early 1980s I have conducted various research projects concerning the characterisation of small molecule such as metal substituted Phthalocyanine, polymers and methods of device fabrications.

The Midlands Credit Compass supports students who are looking to switch universities, take a break from their studies or move away from their current place of study.
University of Staffordshire, along with partner universities in the Midlands region, have developed a framework which will make transferring academic credit more transparent.
The Midlands Credit Compass universities are:
You can apply to universities outside of the Midlands Credit Compass group, however it may take longer to arrange a transfer, and you will need to contact that university directly.
You may need to also pay a small fee for UCAS.
This new framework can help students who are thinking about leaving university, or have left university without completing their course, to easily switch their studies between our partner universities while maintaining a verified record of your credit achievements.
The Midlands Credit Compass aims to encourage student mobility, progression and lifelong learning.
It is a mutual commitment to putting students at the heart of the system, supporting student access, choice and flexibility.
Each module you complete as part of a university course earns you a number of 'credits'.
You need to achieve a set number of credits to complete your course.
If you are looking to transfer to a different university, then you can use these credits rather than repeating modules in the same area of study.
Your first port of call is the send an enquiry to your first choice of university, who will help you to get a copy of your academic credit, and support you to transfer.
If you wish to return to study with us, then please get in touch with us in the first instance.
Credits are normally valid for up to five years - but the Midlands Credit Compass aim to support all students get back into study, so please contact us if you're returning to study after a break of more than five years.
Most students use these credits to transfer to a different university to study a similar subject, however credits can sometimes be used to study something new, however this is less likely - it all depends on your individual circumstances.
You may still apply to transfer, but you may have to start the new course at the beginning of the year.
If you are looking to make a change to your university studies before you have completed a module, the Midlands Credit Compass can still support you, but you may need to undertake the full course if they are unable to accredit any relevant prior learning.
You should still be entitled to funding when you change universities, however, the rules can be complicated, especially so if you are required to start the course from the beginning.
The university you are applying to will be able to support you and point you in the right direction to understand how your funding (including loans, grants or bursaries) will be impacted by a transfer.
Find out more about the way the Midlands Credit Compass can support students who are looking to make a change to their studies.
