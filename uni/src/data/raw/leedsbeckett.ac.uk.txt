Unfiltered Clearing - What to Expect
Welcome to Leads Becket Unfiltered, the
podcast where we talk honestly about
life at LBU.
I'm Shalia.
And I'm Maty.
And today we're talking all about
clearing.
How did you feel, would you say, when
you like went through clearing?
I was so scared.
You know, my mom pushed
me towards it and because I left the
apprenticeship in July
and obviously the only um way that I
could get through was clearing.
So my mom was very supportive of that.
I
was, I was terrified
because I'm quite a social person.
I can
speak to people face to face, but as
soon as I've got to ring somebody, I'm
like, I can't do it.
I remember um I plucked up the courage.
I was sat on my bedroom floor like
shaking a bit.
I had um
my A levels like certificates in front
of me.
So then I plucked up the courage to call
and when I first called I actually 'cause you got like two different pieces of
paper.
I had like the wrong one.
Um but
like the people on the phone were so
sweet.
They were like, "It's fine.
Um if
you just find the correct papers and
ring us back." And I was like, I've
messed it up.
I've like messed it up.
I've wronged
them.
They're going to think that I'm
not serious.
They've probably like
they've got my name now.
They've got my
number.
They're thinking blacklist.
Yeah, this girl is not serious.
But if
you mess up, it's completely fine.
Yeah, it it's good.
Then I got the right piece of the paper.
I rang up.
Once again, they were really
sweet.
It was really easy, you know.
It
was a lot easier than I thought.
So then I called Beckett and they were
actually so nice to me and they put me
through to my professor, um, the best
professor in my opinion.
Like everybody
loves him.
Such a he's just such a great
person.
Honestly.
I love my lecturers too.
I love
the staff at Beckett are just so great.
And like this is just just me talking as
Maty, but they're generally so great.
Like I had, I kid you not, like I had a
list of questions about the course and
we went there and he answered it one by
one and it wasn't given like sales pitch
like we're trying to get you into uni.
It was so human.
Genuine.
Like honestly it was, I loved it.
It was
honestly amazing.
Honestly, the main
reason I came to Beckett was the staff
because I'm like, if that's what you're
going to be like for someone you don't
even know mid holiday, like everyone was
off at that time.
The lecturers weren't
in uni.
So, I quite I quite like that.
That's one of the main reasons why I
came to Beckett.
I got off the phone and then about 10
minutes later, I had an email, welcome
to Beckett.
I was like, literally,
what already?
Like, I only had to call.
I've been been putting the soft for like
a week.
The quicker that you do it,
then it's over.
It's only one phone
call.
Like you don't have to ring back
or anything like that.
You don't have to
call back every few days to like check
in.
You call and they do literally like
you said everything.
They send you an
email within 10 minutes.
They'll send
you like links to apps and stuff.
They'll they'll get you connected.
Mhm.
One phone call guys and you're life is changed.
[Music]
One of my biggest fears when I went
through clearing was accommodation
because I'm like everything's going to
be booked up.
We're in mid August right
now.
What's going to be left?
But with
Beckett, they actually have
accommodations for first years and first
years get priority, which is amazing
because once you're in August, like that
like accommodation sometimes isn't the
thing you think about.
You're like,
"Okay, let me just get into uni and I
can sort out accommodations later."
But yeah, like they were really helpful.
They gave us like a special like email
like in a phone number that we could
talk to people about like accommodation
and get accommodation and stuff like
that.
So that was amazing.
It's like having a personal advisor or
something.
Exactly.
It was so good.
Obviously, you live at home, so like
what's that experience for you?
You know what?
It's really good.
I know that people probably think like
because you live at home like you're not
going to make as many friends 'cause of
course like people are in accommodation
and everybody becomes like best friends.
Um but it actually hasn't affected any
of my friendships or anything.
It hasn't
affected like my attendance or anything.
I'm still very much on time.
Like it
doesn't even feel like I live at home in
a sense 'cause like I like to say like my
friends are come to.
I feel like there's just a
little bit like a bit of a stigma when
it comes to living at home at uni
because people think you're just like
missing out on the whole uni experience
when it doesn't have to be that way.
Yeah.
I can tell you I haven't missed
out on anything.
I've had like the full
uni experience.
That's good.
I use the app and it lets you like it
connects you to people with like
different categories.
So like if you go
to like a specific accommodation or like
you do this course or you're into this
like it puts you in the group chat
automatically and I've actually met like
most of my friends on there like whether
it was through like we like near the
same accommodation or we're in the same
societies.
There's so many things to do like it
doesn't always have to be like going out
into these clubbings and like you know
stuff like that.
And I think people
they're kind of scared because they're
like, "Well, what else am I going to
do?" Like, "Come to Leeds.
I'll show you
what else you can do.
There's so many
things to do."
People like only promote the party and
like partying is like a big thing.
Like
people come to Leeds like because it's
got a good night life.
But it's also got like a really good day
life.
It really does.
Do you know what?
I actually forget that
I've come through clearing.
Like it's
not it's not like a thing.
It's like
it's like you go through clearing
and that's it.
like you don't really
speak about it again like personally.
It seems scarier than it actually is
with clearing.
I think it's more like a
mental battle with yourself with like
thinking what are people going to think
like oh my god.
Nobody knows.
Exactly like I gone through clearing
like that's so embarrassing like you
know just who cares.
Like so many people come through
clearing like like more people than you
think go through clearing and all types
of
and look at what we're doing.
We're all
studying the same thing.
We're all the
same level.
So why does it matter if you
came in through clearing or if you came
in through other means?
It doesn't
matter.
And that is a wrap.
Thank you very much
for listening to our clearing podcast.
I'm pretty sure me and I really enjoyed
it.
I really enjoyed it, too.
Thank you for
listening, guys.
Thank you so much for listening uh to
Leeds Beckett Unfiltered.

thinking about clearing, check out the
Leeds Beckett website.

information.

pass on there.

September on campus.

All registered universities are required to have in place and publish a student protection plan approved by the Office for Students (OfS) to address how it will respond to the occurrence of certain events which may have an impact on your continuation and completion of study.
Leeds Beckett University’s Student Protection Plan sets out potential risks required to be assessed under the Office for Students regulatory framework which, if they were to arise during your studies, may have an impact on your continuation of study.
These risks have been assessed as low risk in our current plan (V1.
1.
3 July 2019).
Examples of events which may trigger the Student Protection Plan include discontinuance of a course or material components of a course, one or more locations at which our university delivers courses are no longer available, or if our university is no longer able to recruit or teach a particular type of student.
The Student Protection Plan will only be triggered by our university if such events may have an impact on your continuation of study.
If it is triggered, students likely to be affected will be contacted to consider the measures planned to mitigate the impact on the continuation and quality of study.
Discontinuance of courses or modes of study is usually dealt with by teaching out the course or mode of study.
Our Student Protection Plan has been developed in consultation with the Students’ Union and has been approved by the Office for Students.
The Student Protection Plan: A Guide for Students, provides you with information about the Student Protection Plan.
Detailed guidance on the plan is also provided below.

Tuition fees for new undergraduate students in the 2025/26 academic year are £9,535.
Our tuition fees for the 2025/26 academic year will be £9,535.
In your subsequent years of study, we will charge the capped fee set by the Government.
Fees for part-time undergraduate courses are usually a proportion of the full-time fee depending on the number of modules studied.
Whether full-time or part-time, if you're an eligible UK or EU student and you are successful in securing a tuition fee loan from the Student Loans Company you won't have to pay any tuition fees upfront.
Placement Fees From 2020, all undergraduate students joining our university to study a course available with a placement year between their second and final year of studies, will be charged a fee for that placement equivalent to 15% of their standard annual tuition fee (please note, this does not apply to courses that are NHS and TDA funded).
What is the tuition fee loan?
Tuition fee loans are available for most students to cover the cost of your tuition fees.
The Student Loans Company will pay this directly to the university.
The amount of your tuition fee loan is not affected by your household income.
Part-time students
You may be able to get a tuition fee loan if your part-time course has a course intensity of 25% or more.
‘Course intensity’ measures how much of your course you complete each year compared to an equivalent full-time course.
This is calculated based on the number of credits you study each year.
For example: If a full-time student was expected to study 120 credits per year and a part-time student was expected to study 30 credits per year then the ‘course intensity’ would be 25% as 30 is one quarter of 120*.
Most courses are designed so that part-time students are expected to study at least 25% of the course that full-time students would study each year.
However, if you have any questions, please speak to our Admissions team on admissionenquiries@leedsbeckett.ac.uk .
*Please note that not all courses which are eligible for funding consist of 120 per level so the number of credits a part-time student is required to study may be greater than 30 to reach the 25% intensity threshold.
Tuition fee loan
The loan is paid directly to your university or college and you will have to pay it back:
Full-time students
In addition to the tuition fee loan, you can apply for a maintenance loan to help pay for your living costs (food, travel, accommodation etc).
It is paid each year in three instalments, one in each term.
How much you can borrow depends on the year of your course, where you live, your household income, your age and whether you can claim welfare benefits.
The maximum amount of loan you can receive to study at Leeds Beckett in 2025/26 is £10,544, if you live away from home, and £8,877 if you live at home.
See table for breakdown of loan amounts.
If you are starting a part-time course in 2025, you may also be eligible for a Maintenance Loan.
How much you will receive will depend on where you live while you are studying, your household income and your course intensity.
You will only start to make repayments on your student loan once you are earning a salary over £25,000.
You will repay nine per cent (9%) of any earnings over £25,000 per year.
See our loan repayments table* for some examples of loan repayment rates.
*Loan repayment information is representative.
Repayment rates may be subject to changes beyond our control.
Some people may be eligible for additional funding available from Leeds Beckett and/or the government.
Check our scholarships and bursaries page to find out more about what is available and who is eligible.
Healthcare Degrees
Now fully funded through the Student Loans Company, you can receive a maintenance loan and a tuition fee loan.
You can also apply to the NHS Learning Support Fund .
If you already have a degree, you can still get the tuition fee loan and maintenance loan to study a pre-registration healthcare course (undergraduate or postgraduate), or a PGCE.
Students with a degree can get a maintenance loan only for an undergraduate Social Work or Architecture degree.
If you are studying Social Work, your funding may potentially change as you progress through your course.
In year one, you can apply for the standard Maintenance Loan and Tuition Fee Loan.
In your second and third years, you can also apply for a Social Work bursary from the NHS.

If you are not a national but have graduated from an institution in a majority English-speaking country, you can use your degree certificate to prove your English language ability.
In order to qualify for a Student visa you will need to provide evidence that you have enough money to pay for your course fees and your living costs while you are in the UK.
The Home Office refers to this as the maintenance (funds) requirements.
Maintenance must be in the form of cash funds.
You cannot use evidence of other types of finances, such as shares, bonds or a pension fund.
You also cannot use an overdraft facility.
The amount of money that you need to have for your maintenance will depend on:
Please ensure you read the following information carefully as it is important that you know how to provide evidence that you meet the maintenance requirement when making your student visa application:

Students applying from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) for study in certain subject areas will need to apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before they can study in the UK.
These can include both taught and research postgraduate courses, and are predominantly in subject areas such as science, engineering and medical subject areas.
When you receive an offer for your course of study, it will be stated on your offer letter if your course requires ATAS.
Courses requiring an ATAS certificate
To find out whether your course of study requires an ATAS certificate, you will first need to know the CAH3 code for that course.
If you are a new student, this should be stated on your offer letter.
A full list of CAH3 codes which require an ATAS certificate can be found on the ATAS webpages.
If you do require an ATAS certificate, it is important that you do not make an immigration application before you have your ATAS certificate as your application will be refused.
Remember, you must obtain an ATAS certificate before you begin your studies if you need to have immigration permissions including all student visa routes.
If you think your course/research may require ATAS and you have not received any information regarding the CAH3 code for your course, please contact International Admissions office at international@leedsbeckett.ac.uk .
Applying for an ATAS certificate
There is no additional charge for the ATAS certificate, but the application process can take up to 30 working days.
You can find more detail about the ATAS and application on the UK Government ATAS website.
The application process for ATAS certificates is completely online.
When your application is granted, you will be emailed your certificate.
Your certificate will be valid for six months.
If you change your course of study, university or need to apply for more time as a student, you will need to apply for ATAS again.
Further information can be found on the UK Government website.

"I started my PhD in 2018 centred around the use of extracellular vesicles as a drug delivery system.
During my time at Leeds Beckett University, I gained valuable practical skills in a range of disciplines including molecular biology, cell biology, and microbiology.
In my second and third year I was also able to travel to national and international conferences to present my work.
As part of the PhD programme at LBU, I had the opportunity to work as a part-time lecturer, gaining invaluable hands-on experience in a role I was passionate about pursuing.
"After graduating from my degree, I secured a fixed-term lecturing role that ultimately led to a permanent position.
I am now link-tutor on a Sino-UK teaching partnership that involves yearly trips to China with LBU PhD students to deliver a Biomedical Science teaching experience."
"My PhD thesis was titled “The role of cancer associated fibroblast small extracellular vesicles (EVs) in melanoma and tumour microenvironment development”.
My project taught me lots of new research techniques, including EV isolation, a variety of RNA and protein isolation and characterisation methods, and a selection of cell phenotypic assays.
I also gained experience in leadership and mentoring, where I supported multiple undergraduate and masters students with their projects, alongside demonstrating in practicals."
"I am now a product development technologist in a university spinout company at the University of Nottingham called PeptiMatrix™, creating and testing peptide hydrogels designed for 3D cell culture, offering an alternative to animal use in scientific research.
Whilst 3D spheroid and organoid cell culture was not something I had experience with during my PhD, many key skills gained in cell culture assays were transferable and allowed me to master new methodologies easily.
Since starting at PeptiMatrix™, I have led the development of new hydrogel products to try and mimic different healthy and diseased tissue.
I am also lucky enough to get to travel the world to meet clients and present at conferences, as well as create media marketing content for the company.
My PhD not only gave me the lab skills needed for a job like mine, but also skills in presenting, creating scientific posters, project managing and problem solving that are critical for industry."
"My PhD was interdisciplinary, comprising computational biology and biochemistry.
I developed a simulation of cell wall synthesis in E.
coli and this was then validated and tested in vitro with a tuneable CRISPRi system.
The computational models can additionally be used as a guide for drug discovery as they can identify the most susceptible enzyme within a pathway.
The model has been used successfully to identify 2 new antimicrobial agents which are currently in pre-clinical development.
I now work as a senior scientist for a drug discovery company where I am developing antibiotics for targets identified with the computational work, and trying to get funding to go after more."
"My PhD thesis was titled 'Are Formyl Peptide Receptors involved in neurogenesis?
Novel in vitro and in silico investigations.' Within this I conducted techniques such as cell culture, differentiation assays, bioinformatics and PCR.
I was very fortunate to collaborate with Animal Free Research UK during this time where I supported a former undergraduate student with a 12-week project.
Ultimately, this data formed a vital part of my thesis and gave me important leadership experience.
"I am now a graduate on the 'Future Leadership Scheme' at Reckitt, an FMCG company responsible for well known 'over the counter' pharmaceutical brands.
As part of this, I complete 3 annual rotations in different parts of the business.
My first rotation was in the Smart Release team and I have now started my second rotation in R&D operations for cough, cold and flu.
My doctoral research gave me many skills vital for success in industry, including resilience, critical thinking, problem solving and project management."

The University has invested £45m in a state-of-the-art building providing an iconic home for the Carnegie School of Sport, housing specialist teaching and research laboratories.
The facility provides a focus for the School’s undergraduate, postgraduate, research and enterprise programmes.
It will also act as a hub for elite athletes, teams and industry partners.
The building includes the following laboratories; Exercise Physiology, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Human movement, Body Composition (including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), Biochemistry, Histology, Psychology, Human behaviour, Hot and Cold water Immersion, Nutritional Education, as well as two Extreme environmental chambers, Alter-G, Physiotherapy clinic, Performance analysis suites, Health and well-being studio, Indoor running track and Strength and conditioning area.
Carnegie School of Sport Environmental Laboratories Professor John O’Hara gives insight into how the world-class environmental chambers at the Carnegie School of Sport will be used.
In the Carnegie School of Sport building, we have two world class environmental chambers capable of reaching temperatures as low as -30 degrees C and as high as 50 degrees C, an ability to replicate humidity between 15 and 95%, and able to simulate altitude up to 8,848 metres, which is the top of Everest.
You'll see on the bench behind me that we have a range of equipment which we use to measure physiological responses at rest and during exercise.
These environmental chambers are unique compared to other chambers as we're able to manipulate the temperature, the humidity, and the altitude, and also the chambers work independently of each other.
This will really enhance our ability to deliver practicals with undergraduate and postgraduate students which have a focus on firmer regulation and high altitude.
Students can gain a real experience of what it's like working in in extreme environments.
These two environmental chambers will underpin our active research programmes.
In particular, they will help us with our collaboration with the defence medical services where we work on projects related to heat illness as well as high altitude.
These chambers are also used and will help to support our work with national governing bodies and athletes in terms of our partnerships in preparing athletes for performing in extreme environments.

The workshops will formulate recommendations for good practices for evidence-based migrant education policies (with the inclusion of migrant organisations).
The centre is developing the Interdisciplinary Dialogues in Education (IDE) series, launched in November 2021.
The IDE will be a series of round-table discussions among a selected number of participants with a view to enriching educational thinking and practice.
IDE aim to provide an opportunity to those with an interest but not necessarily expertise in education to present findings from their research projects, share experiences and/or outline their thinking on a specific field, and explore the implications that this might have for educational research, policy and practice.
The series will become a forum for dialogue on education, which will:

Coaching connections - sense making contemporary coaching in education through the CollectivED community.
Professor Rachel Lofthouse, Trista Hollweck and Jasen Booten
This CollectivED programme is for any educator from Early Years to Higher Education, with or without a positional leadership role who is interested in facilitating cultural change in their professional setting with the aim of enabling children, young people and educators to flourish without fear.
The quality of everything we do depends upon the quality of the thinking we do first.
However, our capacity to think creatively and independently depends on the behaviour of those who are with us whilst we are thinking (Kline, 1999).
Sometimes internal or external pressures can generate fear: fear of failure, fear of letting others down, fear of not being good enough.
Creating the conditions for us all to think better enables everyone to flourish.
Flourish is an 8-month hybrid programme of support As part of a group of between 8-12 educators, participants will be introduced to the 10 components and building blocks of Kline's Thinking Environment® and invited to consider how to apply the principles and practice to create the conditions for you and your colleagues, children and young people to think together creatively and independently.
The protected space created from the initial in-person workshop in November will continue throughout the academic year with six 2-hour online group sessions and two one-to-one thinking sessions which will enable you to make sense of how you are applying Kline's Thinking Environment® and refine your practice.
Cost: £750 (please email CollectivED for more details, to speak to the facilitator or for discount prices for partners and multiple participants).
Our new award will enable educational providers to make coaching, mentoring and professional learning a guided strategic priority for school development.
The award will focus on the creation of an implementation plan which will guide the whole school community through a process of building the skills and knowledge needed to bring about whole school improvements in coaching, mentoring and professional learning.
The award will provide a framework to evidence initiatives that work towards demonstrating a commitment towards excellent practice by making coaching, mentoring and professional learning a part of your core business.
You will work with an allocated coach to create a personalised action plan for your organisation.
Together, you will develop a portfolio of evidence for your school set against the competencies of the framework, your evidence will then be verified against bronze, silver or gold levels.

We are pleased to acknowledge the success of those who have been awarded Senior Fellowship and you can find out more about their coaching experiences below:-
I have just retired as a teacher after 40 years in the profession.
In that time I have been the recipient of good professional learning, but many of these opportunities have been of my own making but have enabled me to progress in my career to a co-headship.
Throughout my time as a leader, I have endeavoured to enable all staff to progress in their expertise.
This has included spending time mentoring, coaching or supervising individuals depending on the need at the time.
This has been a developing feature in our school appraisal process and our school development plans.
As a result of this work, we were awarded the CollectivEd Award at gold level.
I have also completed the PGCert in Coaching and Mentoring at Leeds Beckett and completed a MRes, researching the co-headship that I was a part of.
I hope to continue supporting schools by thinking through sustainable models in the future.
My current professional interest in mentoring and coaching is grounded in being the SCITT Director at Bromley Schools’ Collegiate for the last 10 years, training trainees and their mentors to develop their professional practice.
My current research interests are in the development and sustaining of professional learning communities and networks within Initial Teacher Training placement schools.
Through building and sustaining these communities of collaborative professional learning, we can better prepare trainee teachers for the transition into employment.
I feel that this work matters as without a sustained pipeline of new teachers into the profession, supported by expert mentors, our education system will not be able to provide the best start in life for the young people in our communities.
Through developing the internal infrastructure within our schools to develop the practice of trainee teachers and their mentors, we can maximise the impact of the professional training we provide through school placements.
As a cross-domain leader, both in the military and also education, it is incumbent upon me to develop the professional experience and capability of those who co-create our workplace.
Coaching underpins that development and allows for divergent thinking, enhanced and profound conversation and illuminated problem solving.
This empowers people and creates a high-performance team culture.
I always bring my authentic self to work in supporting others as a coach mentor and leader.
As a writer, I try to find both the words and the media to create opportunities for others to reflect on educational practice, empathetic engagement.
In an educational landscape shaped by neoliberal ideology, I try to switch the narrative from market-place competitive rhetoric to human-centric self-reflection and personal growth.
The work of investing in others and ourselves is crucial to rethinking and reworking educational policy, practice and lived experience for all stakeholders.
For the last 11 years, I have been a Whole School Leader of Professional Learning.
In this time, I have supported staff to collectively create a culture of professional learning for our wide community that is staff and student led, sustainable, built on our core values, allows for choice, and celebrates our skill as professionals.
I believe it is the role of school leaders to create a climate of trust, spark curiosity, make connections and empower others to ultimately make a difference to everyone’s experience of learning.
I am confident that as fellow practitioners and educators that we all want to learn and have the knowledge and skills to collaboratively support each other in doing so.
I trust that by working together, we can learn from each other’s passions, give agency to our voices, and enjoy our professional roles to prepare the next generation of learners to be equally active participants in shaping the world around us.
I am Associate Head - Staff Development at the Crowther Centre for Applied Educational Research and Adjunct Lecturer at LaTrobe University.
I have received multiple teaching awards and consults internationally to schools on culture, belonging and coaching.
I completed my Doctor of Education and Masters in Education Policy (International) at the University of Melbourne.
I am the author of 'The classroom management handbook' and currently lead the staff development program and team of 14 coaches at a large school in Melbourne, Australia.
To support mentoring, coaching and professional learning in Australia, I also facilitate the Australian Staff Development Network and run the online coaching lab .
These projects are designed to improve the quality of education for students in Australia and overseas.
As an educator in a large FE college and more specifically, in my role as Teaching, Learning and Development Manager.
I continually apply the knowledge and skills that is generated and shared through CollectivED in my work.
Importantly, coaching and mentoring serves as the foundation for my own continuous professional growth and many of the other members of the CollectivED community have invigorated my commitment to lifelong learning and encouraged me to continue my learning at Leeds Beckett University as a PhD student.
My research interests include Conceptualising the Convergences between Coaching and the Practice Architectures of Skills Pedagogy in Further Education.
Engaging with other experienced mentors and coaches often provides the catalyst for innovative pedagogical approaches, novel research strategies, and best practices, which enables many of the educators in FE to maximise their potential and flourish in their roles.
As a consultant at the Western Quebec School Board (2008-2017), I designed and coordinated the Teacher Induction Program (TIP) for all teachers new to the school district.
The TIP included a Mentoring and Coaching Fellowship that became the topic of my doctoral studies at the University of Ottawa where I examined the impact of the mentoring and coaching role on experienced teachers’ practice, professional learning and well-being.
I was also interested in the influence of a mentoring and coaching culture on the overall teaching and learning of a school district.
Several papers and book chapters were published from this research study and as a CollectivED Fellow and I was honoured to able to share some of my work with the international mentoring and coaching community, including a joint paper with Professor Lofthouse on ‘contextual coaching’.
In 2018 I developed a graduate course called ‘Mentoring and Coaching in Professional Contexts’ at the University of Ottawa that I continue to teach.
Over the past three years, I have been co-authoring a book called ‘Coaching with purpose: Learning encounters for educational change’ with Professor Rachel Lofthouse and Jasen Booten scheduled for publication in Fall 2024.
Mentoring and coaching–when done well–have the potential to create positive growth-oriented cultures in schools, which matters because attending to the well-being and professional growth of educators leads to improved teaching and learning for students.
I am a collaborative leader who believes with certainty that we are more together than a sum of our respective strengths and knowledge.
I have been involved with coaching others, engaging with coaching of Early Career Teachers, and also provided supervison to senior leaders.
I see coaching as more that something to be 'done', a thing to tick off a to-do list, and more as a way of being and a way of leading.
My association with CollectivEd, including as a Fellow and as a contributor to the Authentic Attuned Coaching for Teachers document, has allowed me to contribute to and learn from their work on coaching and teacher development, further enriching my leadership practice.
The work of CollectivEd as a whole, and of each of us as individuals matters because coaching allows each of us to develop and then this individual and personal development impacts positively those we work with and serve.
I am an Instructional Coach based in an international school in Germany.
I have worked with numerous colleagues on goals or challenges that are important to them.
Additionally, I have delivered coaching workshops at conferences and worked with other schools, and helped my current school achieve the CollectivED Coaching Bronze Award.
Coaching is personalised professional development.
This work matters because (to quote colleagues I work with):
In summary, coaching helps people grow.

The Anti-Racist Teacher Education Network (ARTEN) is a long-established network which started in the 1980s to improve the content and teaching of anti-racist education in pre-service teacher education in the 1990s though to the 2000s.
The new ARTEN was launched on 30th January 2023.
Critical Race Theory: some clarifications
In recent weeks Critical Race Theory (CRT) has received a great deal of publicity, on both sides of the Atlantic.
Much of the discussion is fuelled by gross and inaccurate caricatures of CRT.
Contrary to some of the depictions on Twitter, on talk-shows and even in Parliament:
CRT is a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach to understanding how racism operates across society, including through both individual actions and through structural processes that shape the everyday reality in education, the health service, the criminal justice system and politics.
CRT began in the US but has grown to become an international approach, used by scholars in North America, Europe, Australia, Africa and South America.
Those who use and contribute to CRT are a very diverse group of people, including members of different ethnic groups, different nationalities, different genders and people with disabilities.

Education briefing paper
Our Education briefing paper by Professor Vini Lander, Director of the Centre for Race, Education and Decoloniality at Leeds Beckett University, has been published today.
It explores how the impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students has accentuated longstanding disparities in education.
"Teachers from BAME communities, whilst attending to their own risks post-COVID, may experience further pressures and workloads as they respond to managerial expectations to be central to an institution's address of progression and outcome gaps for BAME students."
This work is part of our Race Equity Collaboratives project which is a set of collaborations created to develop an evidence-led narrative and make practical recommendations to better ensure that the recovery phase from COVID-19 in the UK addresses racial inequity.

The Centre for Race, Education and Decoloniality is committed to developing and advancing professionals’ understanding of the race, racism and decoloniality within contemporary society nationally and globally.
If you are interested in deepening your understanding about the discourses on race, racism and decoloniality then you may wish to undertake our MA Race Education and Decolonial Thought.
Do you think ‘no problem here’ because your school is not ethnically diverse.
Please think again.
It is your school that probably needs to consider race and education far more closely than schools with ethnically diverse pupil populations.
If the children and young people in your school have little to no contact with people of colour are you preparing them well enough to live, learn and work in multi-ethnic Britain?
How racially literate are the staff and pupils in your school?
Does your curriculum reflect the contributions that people of colour have made to knowledge construction?
If you do have a small minority of BAME students in school they may feel isolated.
It’s important that the school environment and curriculum is supportive.
It is not enough to be non-racist.
We have to be actively anti-racist .
The Anti-Racist School Award is an assessment tool to evaluate current practices and initiatives within your school.
It enables evaluation of the overall anti-racism support and strategies that exist within your school, while also helping to give structure to the development plan for any improvements.
You are supported by a coach with a one-hour coaching call each year of the two year programme, and will be required to submit evidence and complete a final evaluation to receive the award.
Intake is rolling throughout the year, with the deadline for completion set two years from your first coaching call.
The Award framework focuses on the following areas:
Standard package
The standard award package costs £495 plus VAT and includes:
Book standard package
Enhanced package
This two-year programme is designed to support schools wherever they are on their journey to becoming an anti-racist school.
It provides a curated pathway towards achieving the antiracist school award within two years.
You will complete an annual self-assessment diagnostic, attend one-on-one termly coaching and support with one of our specialist coaching team, receive a wealth of specially selected resources as well as pre-recorded guidance videos.
Throughout, you will take part in a scaffolded set of interactive webinars with a member of our specialist team to support you on your journey towards embedding sustainable anti-racist practice in your school with knowledge and confidence.
There are two intakes - October 2023 and January 2024 and dates for the mandatory live webinars are set accordingly.
The enhanced award package costs £1,795 plus VAT and includes:
The interactive webinar series included in the enhanced package includes a sequence of six sessions throughout the year to take school leaders step by step on their antiracism journey.
To ensure secure understanding, depth of commitment and empowerment to forge clear pathways to action, an accompanying Padlet with mandatory guided reading and reflection exercises for participants gives resources that participants will need to listen, watch or read in preparation for each session, and decide on a strategic action they will take away.
This course provides time for impactful facilitated discussion, learning and strategic progress.
Each session starts with participants reflecting on what they have learned and what they have implemented.
The last two sessions culminate in leaders each bringing one example of progress in the form of a short case study presentation for others to learn from and also to give feedback on.
Book enhanced package
Session one: Introduction to antiracist leadership In this session, we will explore your positionality and starting points as leads on the Antiracist School Award.
We will cover the key pillars of anti-racist leadership, including defining what we mean by race, racism and anti-racism as well as what the barriers and building blocks might be for success.
Session two: Leadership, governance and professional development What are the challenges and opportunities in terms of professional development needed to do this work and how might we map a pathway towards the requisite whole-school racial literacy needed?
We will take a look at the policies, practices and processes available to us to support antiracist leadership and governance in our schools.
Session three: The school environment, parents and carers In this session, we will take a look at some of the research around the ways in which school environments and our relationships with parents and carers pose a risk to antiracism.
We will explore how your school’s commitment to antiracism and racial justice is made visible and what we might do to ensure that we are actively disrupting the normalisation of majority-white discourses and cultural norms.
Session four: Curriculum, pedagogy and the hidden curriculum What is school for and whose knowledge is valued are key constructs which need unpacking if we are to have success beyond tokenistic ‘sprinkling of colour’ and ‘optics’ in our attempts to embed antiracism into our curriculum, pedagogy and the hidden curriculum in school.
This session will give us space to delve into these together and discuss where we are now, and where we need to get to in order to be an antiracist school.
Session five: Bringing it all together part one Participants will attend the first of two celebratory events in which each will bring one example of progress in the form of a short case study presentation for others to both give feedback on and learn from.
Session six: Bringing it all together part two Participants will attend the second of two sessions in which each will bring one example of progress in the form of a short case study presentation for others to both give feedback on and learn from.
We will showcase all of these examples as part of a growing bank of expertise and collaboration on the CRED website.
These case studies can also be used by participating schools who have completed the bronze award to go for the silver award next.
We are holding a series of professional learning programmes.

The working paper series for Race and Education aims to publish papers from practitioners, post-graduates and academics in the field of education - schools, further education and higher education - on race and racism
Contributions are being sought from both the academic and artistic communities, including poets, comic artists, illustrators, photographers, designers and animators to feature in the working paper.
The movement to decolonise the curriculum, like most movements, has branched out to encompass many subject disciples and found its way into some school’s classrooms.
These organic changes within decolonial pedagogy have prompted this edited collection of works by professionals within the field of education.
At the Centre for Race, Education and Decoloniality (CRED) we enjoy a positive relationship with professionals in education and beyond and offer a space to promote the practise of critical engagement demonstrated in the papers below.
There are nine unique contributions.
Most of the texts share themes such as decolonial schooling, decolonial histories, and teachers’ engagement with race in their classrooms.
The authors represented in this volume are primary and secondary school teachers, students, lecturers, and writers.
Some of the works are deeply personal, others are more investigative.
We at CRED find it rewarding to provide a platform for those employed in the educational sphere to have an opportunity to shed light on transformations which they instigate within education.
This edited collection is a great introductory resource for those wanting to explore the intersections of decoloniality, teaching, race and education in UK schools.
We would like to thank the authors for their hard work and may this volume be a credit to your journey.
This special issue of our open access working papers series focuses on the educational and social realities of Gypsy, Traveller, Roma, Showmen, Boater (GTRSB) and New Traveller communities.
These groups, often rendered invisible or misrepresented in policy and practice, face intersecting barriers rooted in racism, cultural erasure, and socio-spatial exclusion.
Their histories of resilience and resistance remain undervalued in mainstream educational discourse, perpetuating cycles of marginalisation.
By foregrounding these communities, we aim to disrupt deficit narratives and elevate scholarship that honours their agency, epistemologies, and right to equitable participation in education.
The papers in this special issue interrogate the interplay of identity, policy, and pedagogy across diverse settings.
Contributors explore themes such as:

Lack of autism awareness and insufficient knowledge of the disorder hinder early detection.
Thus, Nigerian parents are faced with many challenges when it comes to educating their autistic children, as many of these children cannot access formal education.
The overall aim of Balaraba's research is to explore parents’ perceptions and experiences of barriers to inclusion and how these barriers influence their decision-making processes in educating their autistic children.
I am an educational professional and ex-school leader who uses coaching as a means of developing people’s agency to navigate and change organisational structures and to develop efficacy.
I am currently researching relationships between schools, policy and race in the city of Bristol as a way to understand ethnic diversity of senior leadership teams in Bristol schools.
Lisa's research focuses on the leadership journeys of Black teachers from their entry to the teaching profession to their journeys to middle leadership posts (head of department or head of year) and into senior leadership (Assistant / Deputy / Headteacher).
Her research will review the past and current climate of education policy and experiences of Black teachers from the 1970s to the present day and examine the barriers that they faced as well as their successes on the journey to leadership - investigating the opportunities available, barriers to progression and whether these opportunities are sustained and achievable.
Kayah’s research delves into the mainstream educational journeys of mixed Black Caribbean/White British (MBCW) pupils within England.
The mixed ethnicity population is on a significant rise and is the fastest growing ethnic minority group in England, numbering 1.7 million (2.9%) in the 2021 Census (Office for National Statistics, 2021).
Projections indicate that by 2150, 75% of Britain will be ‘Mixed’ ethnicity, as Remi Adekoya states, “we quite literally are the future” (Adekoya, pp.3).
Despite this demographic shift, mixed ethnicity learners, particularly those of MBCW backgrounds, are often overlooked in educational research (Caballero et al, 2007).
MBCW pupils have faced longstanding disadvantages regarding the awarding gap.
For example, in 2021, only 39% of mixed Black Caribbean/White pupils were awarded a grade 5 or above in English and maths, in comparison to 62.1% mixed White/Asian, 50% mixed White/African, 54% mixed other (DfE, 2021).
Moreover, documentation of the lived experiences and challenges of MBCW pupils in mainstream education remains scarce (Lewis and Demie, 2018).
Therefore, Kayah’s research employs counter-storytelling to focus on the unheard voices of MBCW learners, exploring themes of identity, in(visibility) and representation within the school body.
The overall aim of Kayah’s research is to contribute to the body of knowledge that accounts for the role of race in education and to facilitate the visibility of MBCW people in the field of education.
Systemic racism is rooted in the structure of modern society, in public and private institutions alike, and is woven into the fabric of everyday life, including schools.
In the words of Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.
They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game” - how can a school dismantle structural racism within its own practice, policy, pedagogy while still remaining embedded within the state education sector?
Penny's research explores the LBU Antiracist School Award leaders' journeys as they move their schools towards becoming an antiracist organisation.
Sharon’s research explores perceptions of anti-racism and racial literacy training in education.
One of her objectives is to identify critical factors that senior educational leaders should consider when implementing anti-racist training initiatives.
Another is to empower educators to move beyond surface-level changes in the curriculum, motivating them to actively adopt anti-racist practices that recognise and challenge racial disparities.
The central focus of Sharon's research revolves around understanding how anti-racism and racial literacy training can reshape the professional practices of educators.
It is imperative to recognise that these transformative initiatives extend beyond mere modifications of the curriculum; they are integral to fostering an educational environment where issues of ‘race’ are confronted and where active efforts are made to challenge racial inequality.
By probing into the impacts and perceptions of anti-racism and racial literacy training, Sharon aims to provide valuable insights for educational leaders and institutions seeking to promote a more equitable and inclusive learning environment.
Her research is an exploration of the potential benefits, but also an examination of the complexities involved in this endeavour, shedding light on the nuances and challenges that may arise during implementation.
Ethnic achievement at the end GCSEs in British schools, always attracts attention from a wider audience including government and business.
GCSE results are a benchmark for all future progression be it career, university or social ladder.
Historically educational achievement of black boys has been under spotlight because they have consistently lagged other ethnic groups.
Unfortunately, blackness is treated as fluid and at most as two kinds of black (African & Caribbean).
Instead there are many kinds of blackness situated in their nationalities and have different educational trajectories.
This is the case for black Zimbabwean males.
Very little is known about the educational achievement of black Zimbabwean male who started their education in Zimbabwe and came to continue in British schools.
We have found it difficult to track the performance of black Zimbabwean males because their number is thinly spaced and do not form a statistic threshold.
Thus, my research focuses on black Zimbabwean males as a distinct group within the black underachievement discourse.
I will investigate their lived educational experiences as they transition in the British educational system.
This is a qualitative research, and data will be analysed informed by Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations: The language game of blackness and achievement within the black males underachievement discourse.
This research moves away from the notion of lumping students based broad ethnicity or skin colour.
It focuses on an way of alternative measuring achievement of black boys by adopting blackness situated in nationality (black Zimbabwean males).
Sixty years since the signing of the labour agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Turkey, with a population of around three million and being a well-studied group, what more can be learnt about integration from the Turkish German case?
Using a family case study, applying positioning theory as an analytical lens combined with an ethnic boundary making approach, how has integration been perceived across the generations?
The multi-level nature of positioning theory effectively links the complex levels of macro, meso and micro that shape integration experiences.
Boundaries are established vis-à-vis community of origin in order to position self as more integrated in the German context.

Leeds Beckett University has received the University Mental Health Charter Award in recognition of its commitment to continuous improvement in mental health and wellbeing.
What is the University Mental Health Charter?
"The University Mental Health Charter was created by thousands of staff and students to shape a future in which everyone in higher education can thrive" ( University Mental Health Charter ) .
The Charter is a voluntary programme, that adopts a whole–university approach to mental health, to support universities to become places that promote the mental health and wellbeing of all members of the university community.
The principles of good practice, outlined in the Charter, have been arrived through a research and consultation process involving 181 universities and organisations.
The Charter document was peer reviewed by a range of academic, clinical and research experts.
Why is this important for our community?
Developed in response to the growing concern about the mental health of university communities, The Charter is the first evidence-based guidance that considers both student and colleague wellbeing, in the context of the environment that they study and work in.
Given the severe negative consequences that poor mental health can have for learning, achievement, health and life, the wellbeing of university communities is clearly an important issue that requires attention, resource, expertise and action.
Our commitment and benefits for you
Colleagues from the university and Students’ Union, with the support of a colleague and a student advisory group, are working to understand how our university is performing against the principles of good practice , outlined in the Charter.
Colleagues and students have developed a wellbeing commitment which explains our approach to wellbeing, why we are trying to achieve charter status, and what it will mean for members of our community.
We know that working and studying in a mentally healthy community supports us all to attain good wellbeing, feel happier, have clarity of purpose, and meet our goals.
Our background, experiences, environment, and relationships can all affect our mental health, and mental health in turn affects all parts of our lives – how we feel, function, and interact with others.
We are all unique, as are our experiences and needs.
To achieve a whole university approach to wellbeing that is meaningful for the whole community, we will create an inclusive and understanding environment that values and listens to all voices.
As a university we recognise the work that has already been done to increase awareness, open conversations and improve student and colleague wellbeing.
We have more to do – we want to be a university where stigma doesn’t exist; where any student or colleague who experiences distress finds this is met with openness and compassion; and where they are supported to access helpful resources and services.
A whole university approach to wellbeing and mental health requires us all to take action, for ourselves and for others.
It recognises that, like physical health, we all have mental health that we need to recognise and value.
Together, we will actively encourage healthy behaviours to improve wellbeing.
How do I get involved?
To achieve a university-wide change that is meaningful to the whole community, we need the support of everyone.
We’re continuing to work with students and colleagues to understand and meet the needs of the entire Leeds Beckett community.
Many of you will have already been approached to take part in panels and focus groups.
There will be more opportunities for you to tell us about your experiences and your ideas as we progress towards charter status.
To create cultural change that can realise the vision of becoming a mentally healthy university requires every one of us to play our part.

CITU Leeds – Developing a Virtual Reality Experience Hear from James and from Kevin Gillespie, Sales and Marketing Director at Citu, on the success of this KTP
My name is James Fenwick.
I'm the KTP associate at Leeds Beckett University and working in partnership with Citu.
My name is Kevin Gillespie and I'm the sales and marketing director at Citu.
So the course I studied at Leeds Beckett was games design, and it was quite a diverse course in terms of, there was a bit of modelling, there was bits of programming, and all sorts in between, and they were all kind of skills that I've took with me to industry.
If you think of 20 years ago, how you used to buy a property, it used to be people had to go into the estate agents.
Fast forward to now and with the digital revolution, they just pull out the phone, go on Rightmove, book the appointment in, and then just turn up.
So my current role at Citu is the virtual reality experience manager, and that means I take the models that the architects provide and then apply some texture work, some programming into something that a customer can come in, they can put a headset on and they can walk around the VR space.
We believe that people can come to a centralised location and then just strap on the headset and go into a world that James has created, and that's led to 30 reservations at CID.
A house is one of the biggest things you'll ever buy in your lifetime.
To have that faith in what we're doing based on a virtual world, that's massive, so the impact has been huge.
When I started, there was a lot of set-up to be done.
It's eventually led into a bit more of a customer-oriented role, especially at events and stuff like that.
The lowest price house at CID on the market is £330,000.
Multiply that by 30 and then you can start to quantify the impact that James has had in terms of creating these virtual worlds for us.
As part of the KTP, I was fortunate enough to travel over to Los Angeles for a conference.
It was really exciting.
That was quite rewarding to go there and see that work that I'm doing is actually quite in line with the rest of the industry.
The collaboration with Leeds Beckett, you get so much more from the monetary benefits to collaboration benefits, to the access.
We don't just get James, we pretty much get the whole university.
When I heard about the Knowledge Transfer Partnership, I didn't realise how much was included in it.
It was almost like a stepping stone between university and full-time employment.
You get the best of both worlds, you get the support of the university, and you get the full support of the company, so I've been fortunate enough to kind of impress Citu enough that they’ve offered me a full-time job.
He's a real asset, not just to the whole sales and marketing team, but Citu as a whole.
The Knowledge Exchange is a great space and facility.
Our offices are based outside Leeds and our meeting rooms are quite formal – equally coffee shops can be noisy and are not private.
It is very convenient to have somewhere in Leeds city centre, with a more relaxed atmosphere, to meet clients or mentor colleagues.
Eden Agency and the Small Business Leadership Programme
We're Eden Agency, and we started in 2008.
We build consumer-facing digital products.
At the start of the pandemic, our business kind of flatlined, and we've been used to growing 40% year on year.
We came to the programme to learn how to be salesmen, and to learn how to be marketeers.
The cohort that I was put in was probably the best part of the course.
Everybody had the same stories, it was really cathartic, a really good support group, and I'm still in contact with most of them now.
One of the things that I learnt really early on was that I should be working on the business and not in the business.
What I found most useful in the programme was just having a real good honest look at the way we work and the clients, and really just thinking about what makes us happy.
We are really growing exponentially now.
We're having lots of really valuable leads.
We're focusing on replacing myself and getting somebody dedicated into service, some of that.
I've got a good understanding of what value we give to our customers now, and I'm sort of leveraging and selling our business on those values.
We're now led by the ideas and the feelings of the team, and the staff.
The programme has given us the tools and the confidence to really drive the business forward, and for the first time in 10 years, we're not growing the team around just fulfilling demand, we're growing it around our conscious plans and our conscious efforts.
It's not reactive anymore, we really are looking forward, we're planning, and we have the confidence to do that now.
We've had so many more leads than we would have had with 10 times the marketing budget previously with just that little bit of extra effort and the focus on the people that we want to target, and that's all come from the tools and the material that we've been taught in the course.
"Working with Leeds Beckett has been so beneficial.
From first getting in touch, to applying for the mKTP funding, is a structured process that takes time - but is thorough and tailored to each individual business."
The Small Business Leadership Programme helped me to review our productivity, systems, sales and marketing.
I now have more confidence in the business with the new skills learnt and continue to share will all the team, I have a clear vision of who we are and what we want to achieve.
As a result of this my management team has grown along with new team members who fit the clear company culture.
"Without doubt, the best part of working with Leeds Business School is the impact the team can have within an SME.
It's almost a well-kept secret, the sheer level of quality business support wrapped up in the university..."

Businesses on their experiences of Help to Grow Management and its predecessor the Small Business Leadership Programme (SBLP):
LBU Help to Grow 2023 - Banana Moon
Dudleys and the Small Business Leadership Programme
I'm Peter Dixon from Dudleys Consulting Engineers.
We are civil and structural engineers, so we are the people that would typically work with architects to design, essentially the skeleton of what holds a building up, what people often don't see.
The business is about 25 people now.
We started in 2009 as Dudleys with just a couple of people.
As you grow up in a small business like this, generally speaking, you're good at your day-to-day job, but then you've never been trained or equipped with what it means to run a business, so the help to grow scheme was very useful for trying to broaden our knowledge in that regard.
I think I was sceptical about which way the business was going to develop.
In terms of coming in as a director, I was very comfortable where I'd been in the business for 10 years now, and it was one where I was happy that we were a small business, and the way it was working and how it was running to then think, where is it going to go now?
Are we still going to keep on growing the way we have done?
I think from the business point of view, we were always a well-run business that's operated well and been profitable.
It's more the case of thinking the certain difficulties and challenges we were kind of increasingly facing as we were growing and becoming that bit bigger that your time is just spread that bit thinner, and you pulled in lots of different directions that it was trying to facilitate us to have more tools to better think about some of these challenges.
I think a big part that I took away from the course was the culture side of it.
We've not changed things drastically, but it was some good cues and prompts to think about that a little bit more in terms of some of the things we talk to about everybody, how we engage with them or just making sure that we're getting some feedback where we progress more with investors in people.
The overarching view of what's driving the business forward is difficult to make time for.
I think the help to grow scheme forces you to take that little bit of time out to reflect on so many different aspects of your business over such a broad range that even if you feel that not all the modules will be suited to you, there will be absolutely several of them that give you some really good pointers or motivation to do something that will take your business forward and develop you further.
Tomrods and the Small Business Leadership Programme
Tomrods is a steel service centre.
It was founded in 1973 by John Thompson who is still a major shareholder.
Back in April last year when lockdown started, demand was down over 50%.
It's been challenging, but we've come out a lot stronger than when we went into the pandemic, but there's still a long way to go.
The leadership programme, when I reviewed it in detail, it seemed to cover every single part of the business process.
It provided a foundation for pulling everything together, making it more cohesive instead of fragmented strategy.
One of the major areas for me was the operational efficiency module, and from that, the importance of having the right data collection.
We were due to do an hour or two hours of self-learning afterwards, but it wasn't really self-learning.
What it was is you were just applying what you'd learnt into your business, so the benefits were there, it wasn't using my time, so it worked extremely well.
Following the leadership programme, we're working with Leeds Beckett University on the MKTP, which is a Management Knowledge Transfer Partnership, which is a link between the university, actually recruit an individual with our involvement, and that individual is embedded into our business.
We identified that the opportunities of having somebody to coordinate all of the initiatives that we need to do will lead to not only 20% productivity improvements, it will lead to improvements in culture, improvements in marketing, leadership, and training as well.
It's an ideal opportunity to really drive the business forward.
As a result of doing the programme, we've fast-tracked our IT upgrade, we are more profitable than we've ever been before, we are more efficient, we are doing a lot better, and the future is looking very, very good.
The course has already given me some quite significant insights, ideas and confirmations of strategies I'm taking with my business.
I am finding it really valuable and think it will make a significant difference to what I might achieve.
It is pragmatic, inspiring, relevant and to the point, and straight away applicable to my business plans.
Energy Oasis and the Small Business Leadership Programme
The module I have just completed was spot on and extremely thought provoking - there are a lot of simple changes you can make.
The peer group was brilliant too, as we all face the same issues and were able to discuss ways of improving what we do together.

The feedback can then be accessed by students both on and off campus and at a time of day that suits them, making it more accessible.

Audio feedback can add personalisation and more nuanced comments for the students to take forward.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/clearing/ucas-points-calculator:
Generally, if you have received a qualification after leaving school you will be awarded UCAS tariff points*.
The amount of points you get is dependent both on the grades you get, and the type of qualification (A Levels get different points to some BTECs, for example).
Here at Leeds Beckett we use UCAS points as part of our entry requirements, so you can use our handy UCAS tariff calculator to find out what your qualifications are worth.
*UCAS tariff points are applied to Level 3/SCQF Level 6 qualifications, Level 2 qualifications such as your GCSEs will not be awarded points
Here's how to get the most out of our UCAS calculator:
Be accurate Use your official or predicted grades, not guesses.
The more accurate your input, the more useful your total points will be.
Include everything that counts A-Levels, BTECs, T Levels, and more, our UCAS tariff calculator covers most qualifications.
So don't leave anything out.
It could make all the difference.
Keep your total points handy Write it down or screenshot it.
You'll need it when checking course entry requirements or calling our Clearing team.
Double-check course requirements Some courses ask for specific subjects, not just total UCAS points.
Always check the details when you're narrowing down your options.
Use it early.
Use it often Don't wait until Results Day.
Use the UCAS points calculator now to get ahead and come back to update it when you've got your final grades.
The first thing you'll need to do is to find out what types of qualification you have.
When entering your A Level results into the calculator there is no need to also include your AS results for that course as they will already be counted.
There are lots of BTECs listed in the calculator, make sure to check the qualification title (i.e.
Diploma or Extended Diploma) with your teacher or advisor if you're not sure which is correct, as these are awarded different points.
Once you've selected your qualification, add your grade as well then press 'Add Qualification.' If you make a mistake, you can remove a qualification from the table.
When you've added all your qualifications, your total UCAS tariff points will be displayed.
Start by identifying your qualifications To calculate UCAS points accurately, you'll need to know the type of qualifications you have, such as A Levels, BTECs, or T Levels.
Enter your grades into the UCAS tariff calculator Add your predicted or achieved grades.
If you're entering A Level results, there's no need to include AS results for the same subject, as they're already counted.
Double-check your BTEC qualification title The UCAS calculator includes many BTEC types.
Make sure you're selecting the correct one (i.e.
Diploma or Extended Diploma), as these are awarded different points.
Ask your teacher or adviser if you're not sure.
Add each qualification and grade After selecting the right qualification, enter your grade and click 'Add Qualification' in the UCAS points calculator.
Review and adjust if needed If you make a mistake, you can remove a qualification before finalising your total.

At Leeds Beckett, we recognise a wide range of international qualifications, including the International Baccalaureate, BTEC, and European and other global systems.
Our UCAS Points Calculator helps you convert your results into a UK equivalent score.
Just enter your qualifications to see how your grades translate.
This allows you to check whether you meet the entry requirements for your chosen course and gives you a clear understanding of your next steps.
At Leeds Beckett, most of our undergraduate courses have entry requirements in the 96 to 160 UCAS points range.

You can find specific entry requirements for each course on our website or use the UCAS Points Calculator to see where you stand.

Across jurisdictions, common principles consistently emerge:
These aren’t just buzzwords.
They are increasingly embedded in legal instruments spanning from the EU AI Act to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) AI Principles.
The EU AI Act is the world’s first comprehensive legal framework for AI.
It categorises systems into four tiers: from “unacceptable risk (e.g., social scoring, manipulative AI), High, Limited to minimal risk” tools.
AI systems deemed unacceptable are banned within six months of enforcement.
By contrast, “high-risk” systems like biometric ID or legal automation face stringent obligations around data governance, documentation, and human oversight.
The US approach leans on voluntary standards.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework  offers flexible, sector-agnostic tools.
It is structured around four key pillars:
Though non-binding, it is gaining international credibility.
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)’s AI Management System Standard (ISO/IEC 42001, 2023) complements this soft law model.
China has positioned AI as a strategic national asset.
Its approach blends innovation with tight control with laws that cover:
The AI Security Governance Framework released by TC260 in 2024 underscores this, classifying AI risks as “inherent” (from the technology itself) and “applied” (contextual risks).
China's governance remains centralised and aligned with state interests.
The UK favours a “pro-innovation” stance.
There’s no standalone AI law yet, as the UK government encourages existing regulatory bodies to oversee AI use within their respective domains .
Regulators like the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) apply existing laws to AI tools in legal and medical fields.
In legal services, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) applies its existing Code of Conduct to AI use .
Solicitors must maintain integrity, competence, confidentiality, and act in clients' best interests.
The Law Society’s guidance on generative AI stresses transparency with clients, monitoring bias, understanding AI tools, and ensuring compliance with UK GDPR.
It highlights the importance of professional accountability, especially when using AI for legal research, document review, or contract analysis, which will guard against risks like AI hallucinations or inaccurate citations.
In Ayinde, R v The London Borough of Haringey , decided in April 2025, a barrister submitted legal arguments that relied on five fabricated cases.
The judge strongly suspected AI use and referred the barrister and instructing solicitors to their respective regulators (Bar Standards Council and Solicitors Regulation Authority) for "appalling professional misbehaviour." This sparked disciplinary review and underscored why legal professionals must monitor for “AI hallucinations” and protect their integrity.

In 2024, the Council of Europe adopted the Framework Convention on AI and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law  which is the first binding international AI treaty.
If ratified, the Convention could prevent ethics dumping — a practice seen when companies test emotionally manipulative AI in developing countries lacking digital rights protections.
This raises real concerns: Should a voice Bot that simulates empathy be legal in Ghana if it’s banned in France?
The urgent need for harmonised AI governance is no longer theoretical; it is legal, practical and immediate.
As AI reshapes how law is practised, the question is not just whether the law can govern intelligent systems, but whether lawyers are prepared to lead that governance.
This is a challenge to law students and legal professionals alike: move beyond passive awareness, deepen your AI literacy and become active shapers of this evolving frontier.

Obesity Institute
Recent studies have shown that for some people who live with obesity and type 2 diabetes, a low calorie diet can help them lose weight, reduce their risk of heart disease, and put their diabetes into remission.
The NHS wants to test whether or not a low calorie diet can be used to support patients in ten areas in England.
Eligible patients in these areas will receive low calorie meal replacement products (e.g.
bars, shakes, soups) and ongoing support to help manage their eating.
The support aspect will be delivered and tested in three different ways: digital technology, face to face group support, or face to face one to one support.
This study will be carried out by a team of experts in weight management, diabetes and programme evaluation.
The team also includes an expert patient panel, who will be involved throughout, in co-designing the study, liaising with patients, collecting data and helping to share the findings.
We will also work closely with NHS England who are organising the programme for the 10 areas and collecting data on the patients’ weight and health.
We will share learning from this study in a number of different ways.
This will include: writing reports for NHS England and academic papers, giving presentations at local and international events, producing short films and illustrated journals describing what we did, what we found and how the findings will be used, and sharing learning through this page.

Co-authored by Dr Sarah Waite and Dr Alexandria Bradley
Over recent months, renewed attention has been placed on the sentencing of women in the criminal justice system, particularly following the Independent Sentencing Review and wider conversations about alternatives to custody.
Against this backdrop, Women’s Problem-Solving Court (WPSC) models have gained traction as an innovative model that aims to respond more effectively and compassionately to the lives of women in contact with the justice system.
Problem-Solving Courts represent a shift in justice practice, one that is said to recognise trauma, systemic disadvantage, and marginalisation.
The idea is that, rather than focusing solely on punishment, PSCs could provide a more collaborative and holistic response, supporting women with issues such as mental ill-health, substance use, and housing instability.
But what is happening inside these courts?
How are women experiencing them, and where must we do better?
These are the questions at the heart of our recent evaluation of the Greater Manchester WPSC, culminating in our newly published report, Listening to Women, Learning for Justice .
The research, conducted over the past two years, aimed to understand the value and impact of the PSC model from the perspectives of women, probation practitioners, and magistrates involved in the process.
Our research centred the voices of women who had participated in PSC reviews as experts in their own lives.
Their experiences illuminated the complexities of PSCs by sharing both the strengths and the tensions and challenges of the WPSC model.
While many women appreciated the opportunity for recognition and consistency that PSCs offered, it was the day-to-day, sustained support from Probation practitioners and Women’s Centres that women identified as life-changing.
These services were central to helping women navigate some of their challenges and provided crucial relational support.
The court environment, from the emotive approach to the courtroom itself, was frequently described as intimidating and stigmatising.
Women reported feeling judged or overwhelmed by the formal layout and atmosphere of the courtroom.
Some felt disempowered by the dynamics of the review panel, often facing three magistrates, a legal advisor, and a probation officer, with limited support or advocacy on their side.
This power imbalance had a significant impact on how women experienced the reviews.
There was also a call for clearer, more accessible communication throughout the process.
Many women were unsure of the purpose of the PSC reviews, and whilst some experienced validation from praise, others expressed frustration at being praised without meaningful support from the review.
Several participants emphasised the importance of participation, ownership and visibility, highlighting the need to embed lived expertise throughout all aspects of PSC design and delivery.
Our report includes detailed recommendations for improving the model, from rethinking the physical environment of PSCs, to developing more inclusive review panels, and embedding lived expertise in recruitment, training and review processes.
To coincide with the launch of the report, we hosted the Beyond the Bench: Women’s Problem-Solving Court Symposium in Greater Manchester last week, funded by Leeds Beckett’s HEIF.
The event brought together over 50 practitioners, policymakers, researchers, magistrates, and women who’ve experienced criminalisation to reflect on the findings and consider how to take the recommendations forward.
Following an opening talk from David Hughes Esq J.P., we moved to a reflective exercise, asking participants to consider questions such as: “What is the purpose of the Problem-Solving Courts?
How do your own perspectives and experiences shape your understanding of what meaningful justice looks like for people involved?”
This prompted rich and honest conversations about professional roles, power dynamics, and how we ensure women’s voices remain central in justice reform.
Throughout the day, we heard inspiring contributions from guest speakers.
Fionnuala Gordon from One Small Thing guided us through the 6 core values of trauma-informed practice, applying these principles to the context of the PSCs.
Dr Shona Minson, member of the Women's Justice Board and Research Associate at the University of Oxford, shared insights into the diverse models of PSCs across the UK and internationally.
Dra.
Jimena Monsalve, a Penal Enforcement Judge in Buenos Aires, Argentina offered a deeply moving perspective on care, compassion and human-centred justice.
As a representative of the state, she spoke of the importance of acknowledging the harm systems can cause and the importance of her role in holding the state accountable.
These talks reminded us that justice can be as much about relationships as it is about process.
Themes of restorative practice, interdisciplinary collaboration, and meaningful inclusion ran throughout the event.
Attendees reflected on the need to move beyond punitive models and truly invest in the support systems, such as Women’s Centres, that enable women to thrive.
Delegates in attendance shared feedback about their experience and what they enjoyed most about the Symposium:
“I have thoroughly enjoyed today, what an amazing day.
Particularly insight into the PSC in Argentina”
“The variety of people: academics, probation, practitioner, lived experience, listening and learning together”.
At the end of the event, delegates were asked “ What is one key insight or idea you are taking away from the event?” and “In what ways could the event or research report inform or influence your work?” here are some examples from the feedback provided:
“Hope- change, reflection and learning is possible”
“I work in MOJ on Intensive Supervision Court  policy, could potentially influence future policy”.
The symposium marked not an end point, but a beginning.
We hope that the report and the event spark wider conversations about who we listen to, how justice is done, and how it can be reimagined in ways that honour the dignity and potential of women’s lives.
We are committed to continuing this work, and to ensuring that the learning from women, probation staff, magistrates and wider stakeholders informs policy, training and practice across Greater Manchester and beyond.
We invite all those working in or alongside the justice system to engage with the findings, to reflect critically and compassionately, and to work collaboratively towards a system that listens, learns, and does better.

The findings show that the UK economy loses between £7.6 - 11.6 billion each year in paid productivity due to lives cut short by cancer.
Additional losses stem from people being unable to work due to treatment side effects or advanced disease - estimated at another £1–1.7 billion and £4 - 4.5 billion is provided through informal, unpaid care by family members and friends.
Professor Laura Ashley, a co-author of the report and Professor of Health Psychology at Leeds Beckett University, emphasised the urgent need to understand and address the real costs borne by patients:
“When we spoke to patients about the review findings, they felt current research doesn’t give the full picture.
For those who bear the highest costs, the data reveals only the tip of the iceberg.
Long-term income loss and broader family financial impacts are rarely captured in existing studies.”
Patients report out-of-pocket costs ranging from travel and childcare to heating, prescriptions, wigs, and therapy.
These vary greatly based on cancer type, age, income, and location.
We are now calling for more targeted research to uncover how these economic pressures differ across the population.
The report also highlights that in the final year of life, cancer-related NHS costs can reach up to £17,799 per patient.
Increasing integration between palliative care and cancer services, and shifting more care into communities, could not only improve patients’ quality of life but also help reduce health service spending.
Leeds Beckett researchers contributed significantly to the report’s exploration of patient-experienced costs, revealing major gaps in data on how cancer economically impacts individuals and families - especially in the long term.
While early detection and prevention have clear clinical benefits, the report shows they also make strong economic sense.
One example is the lung cancer screening programme trialled in the Leeds Lung Health Check and later rolled out nationally.
The initiative, led by the University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust with support from Yorkshire Cancer Research, has already shown a reduction in late-stage cancer diagnoses, particularly in deprived communities.
Lead author Dr Katie Spencer, Associate Professor and Honorary Consultant Clinical Oncologist in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said: "This report shows that by increasing our focus on preventing cancer, or in some cases catching it early before it spreads, we can not only increase survival but also reduce costs.
Strategies should focus on reducing smoking and addressing obesity as the main preventable risk factors for cancer."
As the government prepares to release its national cancer plan, the researchers behind the report are urging decision-makers to act.
Among the key recommendations:
The research team are now focused on a follow-up project to examine how cancer-related costs differ across diverse communities and patient groups.
“We must understand these inequalities so we can better support patients, design equitable policy responses, and reduce the long-term economic drag cancer places on our society.”
The Cost of Cancer report was led by the University of Leeds, with contributions from Leeds Beckett University, the University of Edinburgh, Queen’s University Belfast, the Leeds Cancer Centre, and the University of York.
Laura is a Reader in Health Psychology in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Leeds Beckett University.
Her research aims to improve cancer services, care, and outcomes, particularly for people living with other health conditions such as dementia, diabetes, or cystic fibrosis.
She works with NHS and charity stakeholders to use the findings of her research for patient and public benefit.

Centre for Active Lifestyles and Healthy Ageing (ACTLIFE)
Integration of mental health education into veterinary courses is one way to support mental health among student veterinary nurses.
It is now well documented that veterinarians often live with mental ill health (Killinger et al.
2017) and that the profession has disproportionate rate of suicide (e.g., Stoewen, 2015).
Whilst much research has focused on veterinary surgeons, evolving evidence has demonstrated that poor mental health is experienced by other members of the veterinary team, including veterinary nurses, and that nurses can experience higher levels of moral distress than other veterinary professionals (e.g., Foote, 2023).
Potential reasons for this include high workload and low job control (e.g., Deacon and Brough, 2017), burnout (e.g., Scotney et al., 2019), and compassion fatigue (e.g., Thompson-Hughes, 2019).
These findings highlight a need to focus on the mental health of student and qualified veterinary nurses.
Such education can enhance student outcomes and develop essential skills that will benefit their lives beyond education.
Embedding mental health into further and higher education curricula is recommended by Student Minds and Advance HE (Hughes et al.
2022).
However, little is known about what mental health education is provided across veterinary nursing diplomas and degrees, or if there is a consistent approach.
Some areas of good educational practice are evident, including those funded by the Mind Matters Initiative (MMI).
For example, the MMI has offered mental health first aid training to student veterinary nurses with further training courses available (Vet Mind Matters, 2022).
However, this is an example of an optional supplementary course, it is unknown if mental health is integrated into veterinary nurses curricula.
Furthermore, it is not known whether good practice is consistently executed across the UK and there is little research evidence relating to the effectiveness of mental health education within veterinary nurse curricular.
Despite pockets of evidence emerging, we are far from fully and systematically understanding the integration of mental health education into veterinary nursing curricula.
This study addressed these noteworthy paucities in understanding by addressing the following aims:
Our Sarah Brown Mental Health Research grant has helped to fund six projects looking into various aspects of veterinary mental wellbeing, but this is the first to look specifically into veterinary nurse mental health.This is of vital importance, as much of the current research is either targeted towards vets or the vet team as a whole, as opposed to being nurse specific.
We must do more to ensure that the entire veterinary team feel supported in their work and have the tools to maintain good mental health.
It is fantastic to see Dr Hargreaves and Dr Didymus looking into early interventions to support student vet nurse mental health from the start of their careers.
This kind of research is vital in making positive change for the future, so if you are a current student vet nurses, vet nurses or help deliver veterinary nursing programmes, then please do get involved.
We addressed the aims via a two-phase research project:
This project is ongoing, but we will produce a set of recommendations that will help to reform mental health education for veterinary nurses.

The Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University has long been known for its leadership in retrofit research, (check out the Government funded DEEP retrofit project here ).
Our innovative research has been further recognised with the acceptance of four papers for the International Retrofit Conference at the University of Salford this summer.
The group presented research on the analysis of new airtightness testing techniques, investigations into energy modelling & co-heating testing, and economic retrofit evaluation processes for social landlords.
Adding to this success, Mark Collett’s paper on using simulations to validate HTC measurements won the conference’s best paper award!
Here is a summary of the research:
Paper title: Comparison of modelling techniques and HTC measurements in a UK dwelling pre- and post- retrofit, presented by Dr Sarah Price
LSI expanded some of the research undertaken as part of the DEEP project on energy modelling tools.
PHPP (the Passivhaus Planning Package) was added alongside RdSAP (Reduced data Standard Assessment Procedure), BREDEM (BRE Domestic Energy Model) and dynamic simulation modelling (DSM), and compared to measurements of the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) using the co-heating test.
The subject was a semi-detached 3-bed property retrofitted with floor, wall and loft insulation, new windows and doors and draught proofing.
With just one property, conclusions are difficult to draw, but the results were interesting enough for us to continue to model the other 13 DEEP houses in PHPP.
For more insights into using PHPP as a tool for modelling existing homes.
Paper: A comparison of low- and high-pressure airtightness test methods in existing UK dwellings, presented by Dr Felix Thomas
All new buildings are required to demonstrate a minimum level of airtightness, with the introduction of CIBSE TM23: 2022 there are now two accepted methodologies to measure the air permeability of a building; the Fan Pressurisation method and the newer Low Pressure Pulse method.
Drawing on extensive measurements made in the field with both methods the LSI presented the results of 88 side by side fan pressurisation and low pressure pulse tests to explore how well the two methods agree in older dwellings of differing ages, form factors and constructions.
It was found that the two methods were largely in agreement, with an average difference of 2% between the two methods across the sample, however individual dwelling results were found to vary between –84% and 67% indicating more investigation into the relationship between the two tests is required to ensure the two methods can be used with confidence.
Paper: Barriers to the effective assessment of economic benefits of retrofit projects, presented by Sharon Bhorkar
Beyond improving energy efficiency, retrofitting domestic buildings offers multiple economic benefits such as reduced energy bills and creating skilled jobs, which are generally not measured.
This research improved on the Build Upon2 (BU2) toolkit to explore the financial benefits of five large scale retrofit projects, which were managed by a local authority in North of England from 2022 to 2025.
Conducted in two phases, the study revealed a complexity in acquiring data both at the project and stakeholder levels.
In phase 1, participants shared a broad range of insights, from adopting a managerial top-down approach to tweaking and simplifying the data collection and evaluation process.
Implementing these suggestions in phase 2 resulted in significant improvement in data collection, with response rates increasing from 17% -22% to 90% -95% across the various economic categories.
For further details on how to improve the data collection for evaluating the economic benefits of a domestic retrofit project follow here .
Paper: Simulating HTC Measurements for Increased Confidence in Retrofit Performance Predictions, presented by Mark Collett and Winner of IRC’s Best Paper award
As champions of measuring whole-house building fabric performance, the LSI is always interested in validating novel measurement methods.
We typically do this through field trials on real homes, but this can be challenging.
This paper investigated whether computational energy simulations could complement field trials, allowing us to test how measurements perform in various conditions that are difficult to capture in the real world.
We simulated QUB measurements on a calibrated virtual model of a semi-detached, three-bedroom house from the DEEP project and compared the results to data from the actual field trial.
On average, the simulated Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) measurements differed from the field trial results by 12%.
This discrepancy was even larger after the virtual house had been retrofitted.
Further work is needed to determine the root cause of this disagreement.
However, we suspect that heat transfer through air leakage and thermal bridges may be a contributing factor, as these are notoriously difficult to simulate accurately and have a proportionally larger impact on the performance of retrofitted properties.

Dementia Forward team and service users on an outward bound day
Dementia Forward is a leading charity for people affected by dementia, based in Harrogate.
The project is a 30-month Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) , part-funded by UKRI (UK Research and Innovation) through Innovate UK.
It will support the development of a Centre of Excellence for YOD support - including a physical base in East Yorkshire - as well as training and expertise that can be shared as a national YOD support framework.
The KTP is led by Laura Ashley, Professor of Health Psychology, and Sarah Jane Smith, Professor of Dementia Research, in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Leeds Beckett University.
Professor Ashley explained: “Young Onset Dementia (YOD) is when a person develops dementia before the age of 65, and is a highly under-served aspect of dementia support.
The experiences and needs of the YOD community are complex and differ from more generalised dementia support.
YOD requires more innovative, person-centred services and care pathways tailored for the individual and their family.”
Professor Smith said: “At Leeds Beckett University, we have extensive expertise in applied dementia and care-giver research, and will provide Dementia Forward with robust evidence-based approaches to engaging with their stakeholders and tailoring service design.
This KTP has the potential to shape YOD service delivery nationally – allowing the charity to become thought leaders, influencing policy and driving change in the dementia care sector.”
Jill Quinn, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Dementia Forward, has been instrumental in growing Dementia Forward from a small team supporting 200 families in its first year to a leading organisation supporting 4,500 families annually.
She said: “We have delivered innovative young onset services for over 10 years now but repeatedly we have to fight for families to be understood and we know that the care they receive is not age appropriate.
Ultimately, because of a lack of understanding and provision for the condition, this complex illness is made worse.
This new project underpins our ambitions to provide evidence-based and research-informed solutions, to adapt and expand our services to support individuals and families to live fulfilling lives – and importantly influence the wider system, get the data right and provide the necessary funding streams.
“We aspire to transform YOD care at both regional and national levels – and hope that our evidence-based services can become a model for other dementia care providers, influencing care homes, healthcare professionals, and social workers nationwide.
By improving YOD care, this project will shift mindsets and practices, contributing to better outcomes for people with dementia and their families across the country.”
Professor Gary Jones, Director of Research in the School of Health at Leeds Beckett University, added: “At LBU, we are committed to supporting people to live healthy lives through co-creating research that addresses some of society’s biggest challenges, including dementia.
This KTP is part of a longer-term collaboration between LBU and Dementia Forward and we are proud to be embedding research-driven capabilities at the charity to put people first and make a real difference in our region and beyond.”
An experienced graduate will be recruited to manage the project as KTP Associate.
The role, Research and Innovation Coordinator, will be a full-time member of the Dementia Forward team, with full support of the LBU academics.
Leeds Beckett University is currently ranked eighth in the UK for its number of active KTPs.
Gary joined Leeds Beckett in February 2016.
He has held academic and postdoctoral research positions at Maynooth University, National Institutes of Health, University College London and Swansea University.
He obtained a BSc (Hons) Genetics and PhD from University of Liverpool.

Centre of Social Justice in Sport and Society
This research aimed to identify common factors to athletics programmes that are successful in engaging and delivering positive social impact, beyond athletics competence, to children and young people who are at higher risk of experiencing poverty, social exclusion, and discrimination.
Sport has long been heralded as a tool for social change, one that can transform the lives of those who participate in it.
Alongside the development of fundamental movement skills, physical health and enhanced mental wellbeing, sport can also lead to other positive outcomes for young people – social inclusion, challenging stereotypes, cultural cohesion, education, and the development of essential life skills.
However, for many young people their involvement in sport can be affected by a range of societal and structural barriers that operate to influence access and opportunities.
This research aimed to identify those factors that are employed to not only successfully engage young people in athletics programmes, but also to deliver positive social impact beyond athletics competence to those at higher risk of experiencing poverty, social exclusion and discrimination.
The research was undertaken in three phases.
Phase one involved a review of existing materials of good practice collected by Personal Best Foundation supported by a desktop search of additional programmes.
This led to the creation of an audit tool to capture key information consistently and systematically on a range of athletics programmes.
Phase two sought to identify the key programme mechanisms underpinning sport programmes that pursue social outcomes and was guided by a rapid realist review of existing literature.
This second phase helped to construct an emerging evidence-based Theory of Change that was further drawn upon to inform the design of key research tools, used in the generation of data in phase three.
Phase three involved the creation of qualitative in-depth case studies based on seven organisations.
Each organisation was visited for an observation of the delivery of a session, and semi-structured interviews with key delivery and/or management staff.
Where available, focus group or individual interviews were also conducted with young people to triangulate responses from adult stakeholders.
These phases were integral to the development of a Personal Best Foundation Theory of Change model.
The key findings from this research have been incorporated into the design of a bespoke Theory of Change framework for Personal Best Foundation.
This will be used to guide the Foundation’s future plans as it continues to grow and deliver transformative outcomes for disadvantaged young people through athletics.
What this research does is give us the insight and structure we need to shape our programmes with confidence, knowing what will help us deliver the most impact for children and young people.
It helps us understand what we need to measure, the challenges involved, and reminds us that solutions are not always easy and require thoughtful, tailored approaches.

Perhaps one of the toughest tasks in academia is getting your research published in peer-reviewed journals.
One of the proudest moments in my career was the publication of my first research article in 1989.
Back then, it felt like a rite of passage—an earned badge of scholarly honour.
Publishing is, after all, the cornerstone of academia.
The mantra is clear: publish or perish.
Over the years, I’ve collected a catalogue of anecdotes—some amusing, many frustrating—about the perils and pitfalls of publishing.
What once was a source of pride has, in recent times, become a source of disillusionment.
In my field—pain science—the publishing game has, I fear, hindered progress at the expense of those living with pain.
This isn’t just my personal gripe.
Across scientific disciplines, there’s growing concern about the quality and reliability of published research.
Pain research is not immune.
A review I often cite, titled “Flawed, futile, and fabricated features that limit confidence in clinical research in pain and anaesthesia,” captures the issue starkly.
But I’ll save that discussion for another blog.
Academics are encouraged to build esteem by serving as editors and referees.
Peer reviewing is a time-consuming task—each manuscript takes me at least five hours to review properly, often longer.
Generally, the only reward is the intangible currency of esteem.
Back in the late 1980s, being invited to edit a collection of articles that would be published as a ‘Special Issue’ was a mark of prestige, reserved for researchers of international standing.
Today, publishing houses churn out ‘Special Issues’ at a dizzying pace, using the reputations of editors to attract submissions and, ultimately, revenue through article processing charges.
Here’s the latest gem in my collection of publishing absurdities.
I recently submitted a manuscript to a Special Issue for which I am the Editor.
Naturally, I ensured the manuscript was in scope.
However, to avoid a conflict of interest, the journal assigned an independent editor to handle the submission.
To my surprise, the manuscript was desk rejected—deemed out of scope for the very Special Issue I was curating.
My response to the journal was measured; in this game, burning bridges is never wise: “I have had a manuscript of mine ‘desk rejected’ from my own Special Issue because the content is considered out of scope.
As Special Issue Editor, I believe the article is in scope—otherwise, I would not have submitted it.
The issue appears to be that the manuscript was reviewed by independent Editors who may not have referred closely to the scope of the Special Issue.
Could the desk rejection please be reconsidered?”
After a month-long flurry of emails to untangle the logistical error, justice was done.
The manuscript was reviewed and ultimately published.
After 35 years in academia, I can say this with certainty: publishing is brutal and unpredictable.
I suspect many high-quality, important manuscripts have ended up in filing cabinets—not because they lacked merit, but because their authors gave up trying to navigate a system that often feels impenetrable.
Basically, publishing wears you down—an emotional rollercoaster of frustration that makes even the most passionate give up.
Success doesn’t come from brilliance alone—it comes from tenacity.
In recent years, the publishing system seems to have become more fragile.
Shifts in the funding model have exposed how the publishing industry increasingly relies on academics and universities to sustain its business—through high article processing charges, complex open access models, unpaid peer review labour, an overemphasis on impact factors, and the rise of questionable journals that blur the boundaries between scholarship and commerce.
Publishing should be about advancing knowledge and improving lives—especially in fields like pain research.
But too often, it feels like a game.
A game with shifting rules, opaque decisions, and little regard for the people it’s meant to serve.
I’ll keep sharing these stories—not to discourage, but to shine a light on the system and its shortcomings.
My hope is that by speaking openly, I can help colleagues better understand the game, learn its rules, and find smarter, more efficient ways to navigate it.

Participating in sport and physical activity can have lots of physical, mental and social benefits.
However, some people face barriers that stop them taking part in sport how they want to.
A new research article identifies the things that can prevent people with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities from taking part in sport, as well as the things that enable them to take part.
The article is written by Kris Southby from the Centre for Health Promotion Research.
Kris worked with research consultants from the firm Traverse and British Blind Sport to complete the research.
The research was funded by Sport England via British Blind Sport.
Kris and the team interviewed twenty-five people with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities in the UK about their experience of taking part in sport.
They also did focus groups with civil society organisations involved in facilitating sport participation for people with sight loss from ethnically diverse backgrounds.
More details about the research methodology are available in the article.
The article describes five overlapping and interconnected influences on sport participation for people with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities.
These are:
The intersectionality between sight loss and ethnicity creates a unique experience of sport participation for people with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities in the UK.
People with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities can simultaneously experience discrimination because of their impairment and because of their culture/ethnicity.
One research participant talked about the negative attitudes within their cultural community as:
“If you are disabled, other Asians expect you to behave in a disabled way.
In Pakistan disabled people just stay at home, and don’t live independently.”
Another talked about the limited value on sport (compared to work and education) within their community:
“In the Asian culture if you’re making money from it then fair enough, you’re doing something, you’re earning, but if you’re having to pay for it then you’d rather not do it.
If you’re disabled and you want to do something and you have to pay for it then it’s definitely a no-no.”
Another spoke about discrimination they experienced within the site loss community because of their ethnicity:
“It’s classic unspoken things which make you feel, is it because I’m brown or an Asian, is that why, and I’m feeling isolated and you’ve already got your team and I’m on the sub[stitutes] bench because I don’t fit in—‘is that what it is, or is it my disability, what’s the issue?.’”
The research also found that the challenges may be even greater for women and girls – additional issues about gender norms within different communities can create additional barriers.
This is a complex topic and no single policy or programme is likely, on its own, to enable every person with sight loss from ethnically diverse communities to take part in sport how they would like to.
The solution is to create a whole social context that is more encouraging and conducive to sport participation.
This could be achieved by:

What happens when you combine cutting-edge digital health tools, a child-centred creative approach, and a world-class academic partnership with the NHS?
You get CAHREL —the Creative Arts and Health Research Lab at Leeds Beckett University , led by Professor Persephone Sextou .
CAHREL is reimagining how we support children in medical settings, not with cartoons or colouring books, but with evidence-based digital innovation that offers real emotional security and deeper understanding of healthcare experiences.
Based in the Leeds School of Arts, CAHREL is more than a research unit—it’s a creative powerhouse developing interdisciplinary methodologies that bridge the gap between the arts and the NHS.
Under Professor Sextou’s leadership, the lab brings together expertise in performance, health communication, and digital design to create tools that speak the language of children: interactive, intuitive, and deeply empathetic.
CAHREL’s work is creatively informed, rigorously evaluated, and designed in close partnership with NHS professionals.
The aim is simple but powerful: improve children’s experience in hospitals, reduce anxiety in children and give them agency and especially during high-stress procedures like MRI scans, by improving their emotional preparedness and understanding of what’s to come.
One of CAHREL’s flagship projects is the Glowing Stars study , developed in collaboration with Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust , the University of Plymouth , Edge Hill University , and digital health innovator Xploro .
The study targets children aged 4–10 who are preparing for MRI scans—an experience often fraught with fear, confusion, and distress.
Using the Xploro app, children can explore a virtual hospital environment, interact with customisable avatars, and even “take apart” an MRI scanner in augmented reality.
The result?
Not just distraction, but cognitive understanding and emotional reassurance .
Children become informed, confident participants in their care, while parents and NHS staff benefit from smoother procedures and improved communication.
As Professor Sextou explains:
“This is about offering children not only knowledge but emotional security —the chance to feel in control, to ask questions, and to understand their treatment in ways that are developmentally appropriate and meaningful.”
CAHREL’s influence extends well beyond Yorkshire.
The lab is supported by a prestigious international advisory panel of experts in mental health, health humanities, paediatric care, and digital education from across the UK, Europe, and Australia.
This global network brings fresh perspectives and ensures the lab’s work is always at the leading edge of interdisciplinary health research.
Professor Sextou, who also holds an honorary position at UNSW Sydney, is co-investigator on “Future Stories”—a VR-based storytelling project supporting children in palliative care in Australian hospitals.
Whether through immersive tech or strategic partnerships, her work is consistently redefining how children are treated—not just medically, but humanely .
This year, CAHREL hosted two widely attended Eventbrite webinars on mixed arts-based methodologies in paediatrics .
These talks explored how creative approaches can enhance clinical care.
Delivered with rigour and just enough humour to keep the MSTeams fatigue at bay, the sessions attracted creatives, healthcare professionals, academics, industry practitioners and policy-makers alike.
One attendee summed it up perfectly: “This is the kind of work that makes me hopeful for the future of the NHS.”
To students: if you’re passionate about creativity with purpose, CAHREL is a rare and brilliant place to start.
To staff: collaboration is always welcome—no theatre training required.
And to all: remember that even the most high-tech hospital experience can be transformed by empathy, storytelling, and the right digital app.
Because when children understand what’s happening, they feel safer.
And when they feel safer, they shine—just like glowing stars .
Learn more at Leeds Beckett University or reach out to explore partnerships.
Because when children understand care, they don’t just cope—they shine .

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/news/2025/08/slt-aphasia-event:
The speech and language therapy students, from the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, were joined by clients from their SLT Clinic to discuss what Aphasia means to them.
Aphasia is a language disorder that affects a person’s ability to communicate.
It is typically caused by damage to the parts of the brain responsible for language e.g.
following a stroke.
We had individuals with lived experience of aphasia come and share their stories and anything they want those without aphasia to know.
As part of the event, clients with lived experience of aphasia were encouraged to share their stories and anything they want those without aphasia to know.
They were also asked to draw pictures to show what Aphasia is to them.
Claire Dolby, Lecturer in speech and language therapy, said: “Aphasia awareness events are very important to shine a light on this condition and amplify the voices of people living with Aphasia.
Raising awareness within the general population is empowering people living with Aphasia to know that others can support them to feel more confident, encourages inclusive communication and social participation.”
Ava Robinson, an SLT student, said: “I love being involved in events like this and I think they are so valuable for not only my studies, but other SLT student's studies and other students who attend.
Any profession can benefit from wider awareness of speech, language and communication needs.
Hearing from people with lived experience is also vital for our learning and it is so nice to hear from them about what we as SLTs can do in future to be more supportive for people with these needs.”
A client who took part said: “The Aphasia Event – it was a great success!
We truly appreciate it.”
Students and staff at Leeds Beckett University support clients with Aphasia at the university’s SLT Clinic which supports people who have difficulties with communication following strokes and other neurological conditions.
The clinic has two rooms which can be used to treat two clients at one time or one client with students observing via a central viewing window.
It is based at the City Campus of the university and is staffed by experienced lecturers who support students to carry out work placements there.
The clinic runs throughout the year and gives invaluable placement experience to students studying SLT.
It also provides research opportunities into therapies for people with speech, language, and communication difficulties.

The project has been commissioned by the Alzheimer’s Society to explore the current landscape of dementia education and training among the adult social care workforce in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It is asking care home and home care providers to complete a survey about the dementia training that they offer to staff.
The findings will be used to inform Alzheimer’s Society’s future policy and campaigning work in their mission to ensure the adult social care workforce is fully equipped to provide high-quality, person-centred care for people living with dementia.
Participation is in the form of an anonymous online audit survey accessed here , and should take around 20 minutes to complete.
The survey will be open until 9am on Sunday 31 August.
The research is being conducted by Centre for Dementia Research academics Professor Sarah Smith and Professor Claire Surr, in partnership with IFF Research.
Professor Surr said “It is widely accepted that staff working in social care need the right knowledge and skills to deliver good care to people living with dementia.
This is an important piece of research exploring what dementia education and training adult social care staff are currently able to access.
It will also look at any barriers and supportive factors that social care providers identify when making dementia training available to their staff.
“The aim is to provide robust information to the Alzheimer’s Society about both good practice in dementia education and training in the sector, alongside the challenges providers face in ensuring their staff are skilled to deliver good dementia care.
“We hope as many adult social care providers as possible will complete the survey.
We want to hear from providers whether they offer no or limited dementia training, through to awareness level or more in-depth programmes.
All this will help us get a clear picture of what is happening in the sector and how they can be best supported to develop their workforce.”

Sam, who is a postgraduate student, is the first British athlete in over 20 years to compete in the Lifesaving category for the 100-metres rescue medley.
Sam, who is 30 and is originally from Bradford but now lives in Leeds, competes for Race Pace Yorkshire and trains with Leeds Phoenix, all whilst balancing elite-level training with his postgraduate studies as a current MSc Physiotherapy student.
Alongside this, Sam has also proudly represented Leeds Beckett as a member of the swimming and water polo team.
Sam explains what the 100-metres rescue medley involves: “When I say lifesaving you probably think of jumping in the pool in your pyjamas and getting a brick off the bottom – that type of thing.
The race I do is 100 metres – you swim 50 metres, flip, turn and then you do 17 ½ metres underwater before picking up the manikin and then tow it the rest of the way.”
He actually missed the call telling him he had a place in the World Games: “They ended up ringing my dad as he was my emergency contact and my dad said some guy from Belgium is trying to contact you – you need to ring him back.
I rang him back and he told me I was now in eighth spot due to someone dropping out, so I was invited to the World Games.
It’s kind of a dream come true because it’s very hard to qualify.”
Sam says balancing his studies with his competition hasn’t been too difficult thanks to supportive lecturers: “I try to keep it separate but when I am on placement, I can’t just not turn up, but they’ve been really good.
It’s an international competition representing your country, so they said feel free and go ahead.
As long as I can get my hours in which I did then they were great – really good support.”
Sam is travelling out to China today and will gradually acclimatise to the 40-degree heat and 90% humidity over the next few days before his race on Friday afternoon.
The World Games take place in Chengdu in the People’s Republic of China and run from 7 to 17 August.

The definitions of these terms are set out below.
We invite you to learn more about the steps we are taking to prevent and respond to harassment and/or sexual misconduct at Leeds Beckett University.
Harassment
The Equality Act 2010 makes three types of harassment unlawful.
Relevant protected characteristics
Harassment is also unlawful under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 which enables an individual to seek criminal or civil proceedings against a range of behaviours that are causing distress or alarm to the target of the behaviour.
It is important to note that sexual violence is unlawful under criminal legislation such as the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
Sexual misconduct
Sexual misconduct is any unwanted or attempted unwanted conduct of a sexual nature.
It covers a spectrum including sexual violence such as rape and sexual assault, and sexual harassment.
At Leeds Beckett University, we are committed to fostering a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for everyone in our community, this includes students, colleagues, and third parties such as visitors, contractors, and partner organisations.
Bullying, harassment, abuse, and sexual misconduct have no place in our university.
We commit never to use legally binding non-disclosure agreements  to silence those people with the courage to call out this behaviour.
We are actively working to prevent these behaviours and to ensure that clear, compassionate and effective systems are in place for reporting and responding when concerns arise.
We have strengthened our approach in line with the Office for Students' (OfS) new Condition of Registration E6, which outlines how higher education providers must take robust, proactive steps to protect all students from harassment and sexual misconduct.
Our work goes beyond compliance, it reflects our values and our dedication to creating a campus culture where respect, dignity and accountability are central.
We will gather continuous feedback through:

We also work closely with external partners and support services to ensure joined-up safeguarding and wellbeing practices across our networks.
Support Report Respect is our university wide reporting platform for everyone to use to disclose and report any incident of unacceptable behaviour, including on behalf of others.
There are options to disclose and report anonymously or provide details and receive support.

We respond to all concerns with care, fairness and professionalism and ensure that no one has to navigate these experiences alone.
We understand that sharing personal experiences can be difficult, and we are committed to handling all reports and disclosures with sensitivity, respect and care.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/clearing/what-is-ucas-clearing:
So, what is Clearing?
Clearing is a part of the university application process and is a final opportunity for applicants to secure a university place each year.
Anyone who applies after 30 June will automatically be entered into Clearing, meaning you still have the opportunity to study a course you'll love in September.
You are eligible to apply in Clearing if:
You'll know you're in Clearing if your application status says 'You are in Clearing' or 'Clearing has started’ on your UCAS Hub account .
You will see the option to “Add Clearing choice” in Your Choices section of your application.
If you have not applied for a university place yet, don't worry, you can apply via UCAS now and will be entered into Clearing automatically.
The UCAS Clearing process opens on Saturday 5 July 2025 , but you can only apply through Clearing when you have your results.
Results day for A levels is 14 August 2025 .
If you already have your official results, you can call us on 0113 8123113 to secure your place.
Our Clearing courses are available to view from July.
You can apply to us through Clearing if:
Take a look at our results day guide for tips on how to prepare and how Clearing works on results day.
When does Clearing close in 2025?
UCAS Clearing officially closes with UCAS on 20 October but we stop taking clearing applications for all courses at the start of October.
Whilst it's important not to rush your decision, it's worth remembering that our most popular courses may fill up before this.
The Clearing process may seem complicated, but it can all be boiled down to a few simple steps:
Declining your firm place
If you have a pre-existing UCAS application, and hold an unconditional firm place at a university, you are still able to release yourself into Clearing by using the ‘Decline your place’ button in your application.
Doing this will then allow you to apply to a different course or university through Clearing.
Make sure you're confident with your decision before declining your place, as it is unlikely that you will be able to undo the process if you change your mind.
What is Clearing Plus?
Clearing allows you to browse courses at universities across the country, but UCAS have also now introduced Clearing Plus, which suggests courses they 'match' you with based on your application.
From this list, you will be able to tell universities that you are 'interested' in their course, and if the course still has places, they may get in touch.
Whilst this is a useful tool, you don't have to use this.
Alternatively, you may wish to  cover all your bases by using a combination of Clearing Plus as well as doing your own research and contacting universities directly.
Don't worry, entry requirements are important - but so is your experience.
You should check your UCAS Hub account.
Just because you have not achieved your expected grades doesn't mean you haven't secured your place at Leeds Beckett University.
If you achieve better results than expected and would like to join us at Leeds Beckett, please contact us to discuss your options.
Most of our courses will have places available for exceptional candidates and we would welcome your application.
We really value our mature students* at Leeds Beckett, and we eagerly welcome applications from mature applicants.
One third of undergraduate students are mature students, so you certainly won't be alone!
When applying, let us know that you're a mature student and tell us about your relevant work experience, in addition to any qualifications that you hold.
All our professional courses require academic qualifications as we don’t use experience on it’s own when considering candidates for a place.
*A mature student is anyone who is over the age of 21 who decides to study an undergraduate degree.
If you're an international student and would like to apply through Clearing, please contact our International Admissions Team on international@leedsbeckett.ac.uk or call +44 113 812 1111 .
A list of courses available during UCAS Clearing 2025 can be found on our online prospectus.
Please note that not all of our courses will be available through Clearing.
There is no additional cost for Clearing – for 2025 entry you pay a one-off application fee of £28.50.
Free school meals application fee waiver: For the 2025 cycle, if you have been in receipt of free school meals at some point during the last six years (during your secondary education) up until the end of your final year, you will be eligible to have your application fee waived .Find out more.
To confirm your place, log on to UCAS Hub to check the status of your application.
If your place has been confirmed – congratulations; there is no need to contact our University.
Information welcoming you to Leeds Beckett will follow within a few hours.
Your place cannot be confirmed until you have met all of the conditions of your offer.
If you want to book accommodation, we're ready to hear from you.

View our Halls of Residence via our accommodation website and place your booking via the online booking system.

It may take 24-48 hours from when you accept your offer via UCAS for our system to then update with your status, after which you will be able to place your accommodation booking.
If Leeds Beckett University is your insurance choice you are unable to book accommodation until Leeds Beckett becomes your confirmed place of study.
If you haven't yet applied for student finance you will need to apply now at www.gov.uk/student-finance .

When is A-Level Results Day in the UK in 2025?
A-Level Results Day in 2025 falls on Thursday 14 August.
This is the day students across the UK (except if you’re studying in Scotland – SQA results are published on Tuesday 5 August), will receive their grades and make crucial decisions about their next steps.
Whether your results go to plan or take you in another direction, Results day puts you in control.
It’s your moment to confirm your place, explore new paths, or use Clearing to your advantage.
Here’s your timeline: Now: Research universities and courses July: Clearing begins for late applicants August: A-level results released and Clearing shifts into full gear
Be ready to move fast.
Popular courses fill up quickly.
Nervous about A-Level Results Day?
Whether you're feeling confident or uncertain, being prepared can make all the difference.
Preparation is key.
Here’s how to make sure you’re ready:
It's worth making notes on the different universities / courses you like, including things like facilities and entry requirements, as you may end up looking at lots of information and it can be easy to get mixed up.
On results day there's some key information you'll want to know before you make your application.
Hopefully you've done some prep and you're ready to go, here's some additional information for you to reference on the day.
If your results are what you expected – great!
If not, don’t panic.
Here’s what to do: Check UCAS Hub – Find out if your firm or insurance choice has accepted you.
Consider your options – If you’re in Clearing, start researching courses that interest you.
Call universities – Speak directly to admissions teams to discuss your options.
Make your decision quickly – Clearing moves fast.
Be ready to act.
Grade boundaries determine the marks needed for each grade and vary by exam board.
They are usually released on Results Day, so if you’re close to a higher grade, check the official websites (AQA, Edexcel, OCR) for details.
UCAS Hub typically updates from 8:00am on Results Day.
Be ready to log in early to check your status and take action if needed.
Don’t panic, there are still plenty of options.
You can explore Clearing to find alternative courses, consider appealing your grades, or even look at resit opportunities.
Speak to your teachers or a careers adviser for guidance, and check UCAS and university websites for next steps.
Know how to get in touch
If you're ready for Clearing you'll likely have a list of the universities and contact numbers you need to hand.
But phonelines can be busy on the day, and for some of us we prefer taking the online route.
There a few different ways you'll be able to get hold of us on the day:
Make sure you're aware of key times
Clearing is part of the UCAS university application process.
On Results Day, UCAS Hub opens at 08:00.
Whilst you won't be able to see your grades on UCAS Hub, you will be able to see if your application status has been updated.
Some people prefer to get their grades then look at UCAS Hub, and others prefer to do it the other way round, so do whatever feels best for you.
Clearing applications can be made from 13:00 .
However, you don't have to wait until this time to contact universities.
It's important not to rush into any decisions, but the earlier you can contact the universities you're interested in, the better.
Don't be afraid to use the support avialable
You will have lots of support available to you.
You'll have your teachers and advisors from school / college on hand, as well as your parents, friends, and lots of friendly university staff ready to answer any questions you have.
Don't be afraid to use these support networks, and to ask any questions you may have when speaking to universities.
Remember, if it's important to you, then there are no silly questions.
Clearing isn’t just for last-minute decisions; it’s a powerful way to find the right university for you.
Leeds Beckett University offers incredible courses, expert teaching, and a vibrant student community.
If you do decide to give us a call on the day, here's some extra tips for you to get the most out of your conversation.
If you choose to use our live chat, these tips can still be helpful to keep in mind.
Write down your essential information beforehand
This will help you during your conversation.
This should include having your UCAS ID and Clearing ID, if released, to hand, as well as your qualifications and grades .Make sure you also have your GCSE results ready.
You should also make notes on the course you want to study – what has attracted you to it?
Are there any details about the course you’d like to know?
Now is the time to ask any questions you might have.
Stay online if possible
You'll need to be able to sign into your UCAS Hub account once you've made your decision.
It's also handy to be able to check any further details of courses or universities that you’re interested before making your final decision.
Take a deep breath
Remember, the person on the end of the line wants to help.
They will be speaking to hundreds of people in your position.
They know you're nervous, and they'll do everything they can to try to put you at ease.
Be prepared though, the lines may be busy.
You may have to wait a few minutes before being connected to a telephone operator.
Making the call
However much you might want a parent or teacher to pick up the phone and do it on your behalf, this is something you need to do yourself.
Due to Data Protection regulations, we cannot take phone calls from them without your expressed verbal consent.
At the same time, however, it is good to remember that you'll be the one studying at university for the next three years or more, so it has to be your decision.
Make notes during your phone call
If you're ringing around a lot of universities, it can be easy to get confused.
Make sure you know exactly what you've been offered from each university, and the details of their courses.
Record any essential contacts, email addresses and telephone numbers which you may need for future reference.
Whilst you'll probably be preoccupied with everything that's going on, it's important to look after yourself.
Results day can be an emotional day, so if you do end up getting overwhelmed, here are 5 tips on looking after your mental and physical wellbeing during Clearing.
Start the day right
It might not sound important in the grand scheme of things, but taking time to have a healthy and hearty breakfast really is worth it.
Getting your results can be intense, so make sure you're properly fuelled, and you'll be in a better position to make the most of the day.
Sharing isn't always caring
Whilst it is a good idea to pick up your results with friends or family, don't feel that you have to open your results in the company of others.
They're your results, and if you want to open them on your own, that's okay.
It might also be a good idea to avoid social media for a little bit, as lots of people like to share their results online.
This can be disheartening if you see people with higher grades, but try and remember to judge your success against your own standards.
It's more accurate than competing with others anyway!
Keep active
If you need a stress-buster on results day, something as simple as taking a walk could do the trick.
Exercise is a great way to counteract stress, and if you're nervous or need to make a decision, sometimes stepping away from it for a moment can make it easier...
Write a list
...or sometimes, the opposite is true.
If you're entering Clearing, but are unsure which universities you want to speak to, writing a pros and cons list can be a massive help.
Keep in mind things like location and what the student life is like, as well as information about the course.
Keep things in perspective
Finally, try to keep things in perspective.
Results day can feel like a huge deal, and whilst your grades are important, they don't define you.
No matter what your grades are, there will be an option for you, even if it's not one you'd thought of before.
So take a deep breath and research all your options, as who knows what the future has in store!

Clearing is part of the university application process where applicants without a university place have the opportunity to secure a university place after the main cycle has finished.
It runs from July to September and applies to applicants who:
Your child will know whether Clearing is available to them if their UCAS Hub status says 'You are in Clearing' or 'Clearing has started'.
It's important to remind your child that if they haven't got the grades they were hoping for, it doesn't necessarily mean they won't get the university place they wanted.
The prospect of going into Clearing may seem discouraging at first, but it can be a great opportunity for them to secure a place very quickly on a course they like.
We encourage you to take some time to sit down with them and watch our step-by-step video guide through everything they need to do.
Useful tips for Clearing
Encourage your child to research their 'plan B'
It's good to get organised.
Encourage your child to make a list of alternative options, and have universities contact details to hand on Results Day.
They can contact us on 0113 812 3113 .
Keep calm
Make sure they shop around and think through their decision before confirming a place.
Virtual Tours
Research is key.
Virtual Tours are a great way to explore universities’ facilities and accommodation and get a sense of what the student experience will be like.
Universities will accept applicants who have been offered a place and get the grades to meet the entry requirements.
This process is known as Confirmation.
If they don't get their Firm choice, they may well get their Insurance choice.
If they don't get their Insurance choice either, then they can go into Clearing.
During Clearing many universities, including Leeds Beckett, will look at the possibility of reviewing requirements for applicants who have only just missed out, which means your child could still get the university place they want.
If they took A levels, T levels or BTEC qualifications, they should check their UCAS Hub on results day to find out if their place has been confirmed.
Leeds Beckett University releases the entry requirements and details of courses that are available through Clearing from early July.
This is the opportunity for your child to start looking around at what their options are, if they don't get the grades they hope for.
It is important that you also encourage them to do so.
Here at Leeds Beckett we use UCAS points as part of our entry requirements.
Our handy UCAS tariff calculator will help your child find out what their qualifications are worth before contacting universities on results day.
They shouldn’t give up on the course they want – there’s little value in just picking any course to get a place at university.
Instead, it’s a case of finding a similar course, at a university where they would be happy to study.
They should be asking the same questions as when they were thinking about their Firm and Insurance choices.
Do they want a campus university?
Do they want a city university?
Do they want a university only so many miles from home?
This way, on results day, should they not be accepted at their university of choice, they already have a good idea of where else they would like to apply.
The big message is that Clearing shouldn’t be seen as a negative.
Every year thousands of people find a place through Clearing and are very happy with where they go.
Encourage your child to go into it with a positive frame of mind – ‘if I don’t get the grades I’m after, these are my options and this is what I’m going to do.’
Doing some research before results day will save your child time.
If they go through Clearing, they should ring around different universities to find out more about courses that interest them.
Based on their grades, they may receive a verbal offer of a place.
They may capture a number of verbal offers on the day; however, they cannot confirm an offer before 15:00 on A level results day.
Each university decides how long they leave a verbal offer open – at Leeds Beckett we would usually say midnight on the day we make an offer.
The best advice is for your child not to wait, as universities are unable to guarantee how long places will be available for.
If they've done their research in advance, then it should all be about thinking through their decision.
Read our student's stories to find out more about what their Clearing experience at Leeds Beckett was like.
If your child wants us to talk to you, for whatever the reason, at Leeds Beckett we are happy to do this.
However, due to Data Protection regulations we need their permission to do so.
Without permission, we can only talk to them.
Also, even if we have their permission to talk to you, it is still them we can only make an offer to.
If they are planning a summer holiday, it’s worth reminding them of this.
They can either add your details in the 'Nominated contact' field on their UCAS application or, if they've already applied and didn't do this, they can contact UCAS directly on 0371 468 0468 to nominate you as a contact.

Hi, I'm El Dana and I came to Leeds Beckett University through the UCAS Clearing process to study a Media Communication Cultures course.
I'd like to share my top tips on navigating the process with you.
Clearing is a lifeline for students who didn't quite hit their A-level targets or , like me, had a change of heart about their uni versity choices.
It 's basically a process where universities fill their remaining course places .
If you're without an offer and places are still up for grabs, you can dive into Clearing .
Trust me, it's a brilliant chance to land a spot on a course that suits you, even after the main application rush.
Do your homework : Before R esults D ay, I made a list of unis and courses I fancied.
I gathered all my important doc ument s - test scores, personal statement, and reference letters.
I even pre-registered for Clearing support to get a head start on info and help.
Learn from others : My own experience taught me a lot.
I was after a course that valued coursework over exams.
A friend suggested Beckett, and it quickly became my top pick.
Initially, I had my heart set on London, but after some digging on UCAS, I realised Leeds Beckett was a better f it .
T he course modules were right up my street and matched my academic goals perfectly .
Despite falling short of the required points, they took me on as a mature student.
Keep your cool : Staying calm on R esults D ay is key.
I managed my stress by surrounding myself with positive people and staying focused.
Even though I had offers from my top five UCAS choices, I felt a strong pull towards Leeds Beckett.
I prepared for all outcomes and rang Beckett about a place in Clearing as soon as I got my results.
Chat it up : I used uni versity hotlines, websites , and went to O pen D ays to get all the info rmation I needed to help me with my decision making .
I asked about courses, accommodation, and student support.
Clear communication with uni versity staff is crucial; be direct and go prepared with questions.
As someone once told me, "If you don't ask, you don't get." I took the initiative to contact unis to make sure I was making the right choice and even chatted with current students for their take.
Be flexible : Being open to different courses and uni versitie s is important during Clearing.
I initially planned to study in London, but after exploring options on UCAS, I discovered that Leeds Beckett offered a course that better suited my goals.
While London was my first choice, Leeds offered a welcoming community and resources that were a better fit for me – if I hadn’t been open minded , I would have never considered it .
Act fast, but don’t rush : Quick decision-making is crucial , courses can fill up with people .
But you don’t need to make hasty decisions – after getting multiple offers and meeting their requirements, I compared each one carefully.
My positive experience at a Leeds Beckett O pen D ay sealed the deal for me.
Once you've made your choice, confirm your place quickly on UCAS Hub and start sorting out things like accommodation and preparing for the term ahead.
UCAS Clearing is a common route that many students take, and it can lead to fantastic opportunities.
Approaching it with an open mind and positive attitude is key.
Staying organised and proactive before and after R esults D ay makes a world of difference.
By registering for Pre-Cleari ng support , comparing offers, confirming promptly, and getting ready for the start of term, I secured a course that matched my ambitions perfectly.
Remember, Clearing can open doors to great outcomes, so embrace the process and keep your eyes on the prize.

I initially applied to York University to study Politics and International Relations.
I knew that was the subject that I wanted to do so the night before results day I made a list of all the places that did Politics and International Relations just in case if I didn’t get in.
A friend had applied to Leeds Beckett and got an unconditional offer to do this course as well.
She said that they were a good department with experienced staff and so I added Beckett to my list.
When I got my results, I didn’t get what I wanted.
Although I did well in two subjects the third let me down.
York was off the table and it was time for plan B.
I knew that in order to get into Leeds Beckett I had to get a verbal acceptance and then follow up with UCAS for it to be guaranteed as a place.
I went online to the Leeds Beckett website and Becky the Chat Bot popped up.
It asked me what my results were to see if I could be accepted.
It was really easy to use, I put in my results and it said that I would be able to get a place with my desired subject.
I put the information into UCAS and I had my place accepted.
I felt a huge sense of relief!
An hour after I had my verbal acceptance, I got a phone call from the head of Politics and International Relations, Sophia Price.
She wanted to check if I had any questions as I hadn't visited the department or talked to any of the staff.
I said that I was planning on visiting the university in the coming weeks, so she insisted on meeting with me personally.
I turned up at the university and was taken on a tour of the library, the Students’ Union and a few of the lecture halls.
After the tour was over, I called Sophia and told her we were here.
She came down from her office to talk to me.
This was the head of department and she probably had 100 other things to do like planning the next years course, but she sat and talked with me and my parents for an hour about what the course was like, what the lecturers were like, societies and extracurricular activities.
She really reassured my parents who were worrying about what the next few years might be like for me at university.
This level of support from the university was greatly appreciated.
I have really enjoyed my first year at Leeds Beckett; the course is great, I have made fantastic friends, joined different societies and made the most of every minute!

Alumni spotlight | Eve Carter
Eve studied BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated) at Leeds Beckett, graduating in 2024.
Here, she shares her story of joining Leeds Beckett through Clearing, what she enjoyed about her course, and why it was a great decision to study it.
Course: B A (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated)
I can't remember the exact words used by the person who answered my phone call to Leeds Beckett clearing on the 18 August 2022.
But, as I stand here now almost two years later, having just celebrated my graduation ceremony and achieving a first-class degree, I can still clearly recall the feelings of dread, worry and uncertainty that filled me as I made the phone call.
If someone asked me to describe my experience of A level results day 2022 at any point between the day itself and my first day at Leeds Beckett University, I would've likely referred to it as "one of the worst mornings of my life".
I'd not received the A level results I both needed and wanted to meet the conditions of my previous offers from Leeds Beckett.
As a result, I began to feel my aspirations of becoming a Primary School teacher being left behind, feeling as though it was no longer something that was attainable for me.
Now I'm able to look back on this day with a feeling of contentment and relief as it was my unexpected A level results and further contact with Leeds Beckett University during Clearing that led me to enrol on the BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated) degree.
This degree wasn't one that I was initially aware of when I applied to Leeds Beckett University many months earlier.
The thought of having to complete a three-year degree in two years was one that I was initially apprehensive of, having been disheartened by my unexpected A level results.
I was unsure of whether I would be able to keep up with the pace of an accelerated degree and the possible workload that may come with this.
Regardless of my concerns, I enrolled on the course and can honestly say that I have not looked back since.
While yes, the workload is increased, and the pace is heightened to that of an average three-year course, the support provided by the staff both involved with the course and within Leeds Beckett University aided me immensely with any overwhelming feelings that may have arisen during my time at Leeds Beckett.
Throughout my two years completing the BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated) degree, I was never in a position where I was left feeling out of my depth.
While I can attribute some of this to pushing myself to remain motivated and consistent, a large part of this came from the continuous contact and reassurance provided by the course and module leaders working within this course.
While studying for this degree, the class size never exceeded more than 35 students.
I found this to be something that helped me immensely throughout my time at university, as a smaller class size allowed me to develop a much more personal relationship with both my classmates and teachers.
When faced with a class size in the hundreds or more, it would be much harder to access the one-on-one time and guidance that I felt was continuously accessible to me.
The BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated) degree allows students to complete both Level 4 and Level 5 within a one-year time frame, with two work-based placements also occurring as part of two modules completed in this year.
The fast-paced nature of this degree is not for everyone, however, it's something that I feel has provided me with numerous advantages.
The increased pace of this course allowed me to work on my time-management skills, adaptability and ability to work under pressure, skills that I feel will aid me greatly as I apply for permanent job roles in the future.
As well as this, for students such as myself that are hoping to progress on to study an MA and possibly a PGCE, this course allows you to obtain a degree a whole year earlier than a three-year course allows - providing both an extra year of time and finances to do so.
The modules within this course provide a wide range of insights into the technicalities of teaching and understanding children at great depths as well as allowing for opportunities to put this knowledge into practice.
I felt that the information included within these modules is also well designed to support students in choosing their dissertation subject, providing a variety of opinions and educational aspects for students to explore before focusing in on one as part of their final dissertation submission.
When I began this course two years ago, I was lacking greatly in motivation, self-belief and inspiration.
In September of this year, I'm due to start my MA in Education and full of confidence regarding my own abilities.
I feel that this accentuates the effect that the BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated) degree has had on my own self-belief and future motivation.
While I'm only able to speak from my own experience, and I do understand that an accelerated route is not one that everyone may wish to take, for those that it may appeal to, it's something I can't recommend enough.
I have felt continuously supported while also being prompted to express my opinions and explore my own interests and beliefs.
As I now look back on A level results day 2022, I no longer view it as "one of the worst days of my life", and instead look at it as the day my future took a different turn and led me on a path where I was able to grow my confidence freely and push myself to my fullest potential.
Eve is an alumna of Leeds Beckett who studied BA (Hons) Primary Education (accelerated), graduating in 2024.

Hi, my name is Harry and I'm a Building Surveying student at Leeds Beckett.
In this blog, I’ll be talking about my experience deciding to apply through Clearing with Leeds Beckett after my gap year.
I know what it’s like to be unsure of the direction you want to go in.
So, if you’re interested in how I chose my course and got into LBU, then this blog is for you.
During my A-levels, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life.
So much so, I took a gap year.
I thought this would give myself the time to work out how I would become immensely rich and successful.
Spoiler alert (if you hadn’t guessed already) that didn’t happen!
Ok, you’re going to have to stick with me here, because there are messages to this story.
But first you’ll need some context.
Now, although I had little direction at the time, I had adamantly convinced myself that I would never go to university.
This was mainly because I had seen YouTubers talking about how university was a waste of time and money (I’ve now learnt this isn’t true).
From hearing this I thought I should immediately jump into my career and begin my rapid ascension to the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world.
Simple right?
Of course, that hasn’t happened…despite my best efforts!
After months of applying for jobs online, I secured a position working in NHS Admin.
I did this for a few months, and while it was rewarding work, I realised admin wasn’t what I wanted to pursue as a career.
However, this job was a step forward and helped to direct me on my path to university.
Remember everything you try (even if you don't like it) is one step closer to finding your passion.
At the same time as my NHS Admin job, I was also developing my own business, which I later turned into a limited company.
I didn’t continue the business long-term, but it taught me a huge amount.
For example, I learnt how to create and run a company, basic legal principles, basic accountancy, and many other things which were invaluable when deciding what I wanted to pursue as a career and finding out what interests me.
Now, by this point in time, I was really considering the options for my future and attending university.
I spoke to my friends and several of them who had already started their courses in Leeds told me about how amazing the city was.
If I decided to go to uni, the thought of having friends local to me was a great comfort, so I began to look at options for studying in Leeds.
I was confident pursuing a practical based course would help prepare me for a good career and give me the hands-on experience I wanted.
This led me to look at Leeds Beckett and their diverse range of courses .
I’d heard that at Leeds Beckett, students are taught technical skills and receive real-world experience in the field of their choice.
I knew a practical based course was perfect for me because I wanted to study a degree which would prepare me for the world of work.
Now I knew where I wanted to study, I just needed to choose which course.
When choosing my course, I thought about my interests, what I’ve enjoyed from my previous work experiences and most importantly, what career I would want to pursue long-term.
After much thought, I decided that I wanted to enter the property industry.
I thought over everything I had learned about myself during my gap year, and my decision to enter the property industry made a lot of sense.
The property industry appeals to my entrepreneurial nature, and what I had learnt about creating a limited company.
With this future career goal in mind, I made my decision to look at Building Surveying courses at Leeds Beckett.
So, my top tip here is to look into everything that interests you when you’re thinking about which course to study.
Regardless of how random the idea may be, you might just stumble upon your passion and find there’s a course for it, much like I have.
As it took me time to decide what I wanted to do, I missed the initial UCAS application deadline, so I ended up applying to Leeds Beckett through Clearing.
Luckily, my Clearing experience was smooth sailing and the process simple.
I actually applied the day before the Clearing deadline for my course.
So, I was very happy when the university offered me a place the very next day.
That I could apply in a day is a testimony to how supportive Leeds Beckett was about my application, and how swift they are with the Clearing process.
On the day, I called LBU’s dedicated telephone clearing line very flustered.
I was afraid that I was too late to be accepted onto my course for the upcoming academic year.
Thankfully, the person on the end of the phone was reassuring.
They even said I could have extra time to apply if I needed to, which was encouraging.
They gave me a very clear list of everything I needed to apply with, this included my A Level, AS and GCSE results certificates and my personal statement.
I got a hold of all the documents I needed that day and the next day I received a call from my course manager offering me a place at Leeds Beckett.
After receiving this verbal offer I formally accepted it by signing into my UCAS Hub account, clicking on ‘Add Clearing Choice’ and filling in the course details.
The Clearing process itself was a breeze.
I can say with certainty that accepting my offer was the best decision of my life and I haven’t regretted it once - even during exam season!
I suppose then that final message is, don’t be afraid to make that life-changing decision, because it might just be the best decision you ever make.
It's always best to be prepared.
Which is why we've put together a handy hub of information.
Hi, my name is Harry and my pronouns are he/him/his.
I am a second year Building Surveying student living in Leeds and I enjoy playing Squash and gaming with my friends.
I hope to support every student in feeling as comfortable as possible during their time at Leeds Beckett, while also enabling them to challenge their own beliefs on what it's possible to achieve at university.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-university/how-to-write-a-personal-statement:
The personal statement is your chance to show universities why you would make a great student on your course.
It helps us get to know you and is an important factor in the application process.
To help you get started, we’ve put together a guide below.
There are certain steps to follow in order to make sure you are ticking all the boxes when you write your personal statement.
In this guide, we've broken it down into manageable sections so you can feel more confident before hitting ‘send’ on your UCAS application.
Our guide to writing your personal statement
The first thing to figure out is what the purpose of a personal statement is…
Your personal statement is your chance to show universities what you’re all about!
You may be under the impression that getting into university is just about getting good grades, but that is only one element of why a university might make you an offer.
Universities want people who have something about them, so they are also looking at your personality, what your interests are, what motivates you and your personal statement is your opportunity to tell them all about this.
Before you start writing…
The most important thing to do before you write your personal statement is to plan.
Make sure that you carefully think about the different sections you want to include, the type of message you are trying to get across and the most important points you want to include.
Once you have the framework, it's just a case of following your plan and ensuring that you use your own personal tone and writing style to show your personality.
Take a look at the examples below showing you how to complete the different sections of a personal statement.
It’s important to note that these are just examples, here to inspire your own personal statement and should not be copied.
Universities take plagiarism extremely seriously and there are advanced systems that can detect any form of copy and paste (even if you just change a few words).
You don’t need to copy anyway, you’ve got this!
Your introduction should be a collection of short sentences and the aim is to catch the reader’s attention.
Don’t waste time with lots of detailed long sentences where there is a chance your point could get lost.
The introduction is all about showcasing your enthusiasm so make sure that you explain why you are saying something.
Don’t just say “I find politics really fascinating”.
Tell them why you find it fascinating, what specifically interests you about it.
Below is an example of how to start a personal statement.
I have always been interested in helping people and sharing my knowledge to try and solve other people’s problems.
Growing up as the eldest within a large family with lots of responsibilities, I have learnt to be kind, caring and to be a great listener.
I understand that there are many issues affecting young people and I want to develop this knowledge by studying Childhood Studies at university.
I have always wanted to work for a children’s charity to help give children from lower economic backgrounds the motivation to develop their skills to want to continue doing well at school.
I believe that this degree will provide me with the experience and knowledge to do this and make a difference within the community.
This section is a key part of your personal statement.
It is your opportunity to show the university why you have a passion for the subject you are applying for.
Think about the following:
Below is an example of writing about your subject in a personal statement.
Storytelling is such an important part of everyday life.
One element within English literature which I find the most fascinating is symbolism.
I read a lot in my spare time and find it is a great way to relax and unwind.
I love analysing the texts and working out how the green light in The Great Gatsby represents his dream and hope or how the blood in Shakespeare’s Macbeth represents Duncan’s murder and the guilt Macbeth feels about this.
I am looking forward to developing this analytical skill further and learning about a variety of texts from different genres, outside of my initial circle of literature.
I also write and perform my own poetry at open mic nights and have been particularly inspired by Sylvia Plath.
Not only is literature a key part of my personal life but I also have experience studying and writing texts from my time studying English Literature for my A levels.
This combination of passion, personal and academic experience is a great foundation to the study of English Literature at university.
When you mention any social activity or interest, try and think about how they showcase an element of your personality or how they reflect a skill relevant to the course.
This section will tell a university about your character and the type of person you are.
You can also discuss any work experience relevant to the course or any volunteering projects you have participated in.
Where possible refer each point back to what you have learnt and how it could be relevant to the course.
Below is an example of writing about your hobbies and work experience in a personal statement.
Outside of my studies, I am a very confident rugby player.
Rugby has always been a love of mine and is a sport that I have really worked hard to perfect.
I not only compete on a regular basis, but I also now teach children on a Saturday at the local club.
Playing rugby has taught me many skills including teamwork, mental and physical strength, commitment as well as the ability to motivate people.
Working with children has also taught me a new skill set including patience, the ability to communicate with a wide range of audiences as well as problem solving.
I know that these skills will be useful and can be developed on further whilst studying Sports Coaching at university and in my future career.
This is your chance to leave a lasting impression.
Write something that will stand out, that the university will remember you by.
This would usually be in the form of wrapping together all points made so far and adding a final unique spin.
You may use this opportunity to reflect on your past and how that has led you to the decision to study at this university or specific course.
You could also talk about your future aspirations, how you think this course will help you achieve these or maybe you want to reflect on your chosen industry at the moment and think about how your ideas would help develop or change this for the better.
Whatever you choose to end with, ensure that you keep it concise and powerful.
Below is an example of writing your conclusion in a personal statement.
"The fashion world is always adapting but one thing that isn’t changing is the way that fashion impacts on our planet.
Global warming is real and it is happening.
The fashion industry plays a major role in this with big companies promoting quick fashion trends and excessive use of plastic packaging.
Although more and more people are becoming aware of these issues, there are still not enough options for people to buy into sustainable fashion.
By studying Fashion at university and gaining a full understanding of the industry, I want to be able to make a change.
One of the main issues with sustainable clothing is the limitations it provides and so my future goals is to create a popular clothing company which provides up to date designs and current trends, that is easily accessible but is sustainable and good for our planet."
Before you submit your application…
Once you have finished, leave it for a day before proofing and editing so that you are approaching it with a fresh pair of eyes.
Finally, make sure that you are happy with it!
This is your application and your chance to showcase yourself to the best of your ability.
Give it your best shot!
Your personal statement dos and don'ts checklist
All personal statements are checked for similarity – don’t copy or share yours as plagiarism could affect the outcome of your application.
Be original Rely on a spellchecker – it is not as reliable as proofing your statement yourself Try to include all your qualities.
Instead focus on the ones you are most proud of Procrastinate or leave it to the last minute – your statement could end up missing valuable information and you want to leave enough time for proofing Talk about hobbies that are too general or irrelevant to your course – they will not make you stand out Just list your achievements – focus on the skills you’ve learned from any achievements and why they will help you on the course Treat it as a list of skills and interests – without context and reasoning they will lose their value Exaggerate or make things up – it is much easier to get caught out than you might think Repeat yourself.
You’ve only got 4,000 characters, so don’t waste any saying something you’ve already covered Be shy.
This is your opportunity to showcase why you

Hi, I'm Ben.
This is a quick-fire list of the top five reasons I’ve enjoyed my time at Leeds Beckett University (just on a quick side note, there are many more than just five reasons!)
At Leeds Beckett, there's such a large number of students, and as a result, there is a vast array of different people you can meet.
Whether it be in a sports team, societies or even just in halls of residence, you meet so many people which only enhance your time at Leeds Beckett.
At any time of day, there are people all around campus and there's such a buzz.
Even if you don’t know 99% of them, it’s still really nice to be surrounded by students that are similar to you.
As mentioned in previous blogs here, Leeds is the perfect city for student.
It’s no wonder really - there's a student population of over 60,000 between all universities.
Shopping, nightlife, things to do, you name it - Leeds has got it.
Another big plus point for Leeds is that once you’re in the city centre, you can walk to pretty much all areas of the centre in a matter of minutes.
There is a lot crammed into such a small area in Leeds which makes it perfect for getting around.
The BUCS tables don’t lie and as I’m sure you can see, Leeds Beckett scores pretty highly when it comes to sport.
What’s so great about sport at Beckett is that you don’t even have to be at the top of your game for you to reap the benefits.
There are multiple teams overs tens of sports, all competing at different standards.
And to be honest, even if you don’t want to play, you can still be part of a sports team with regular socials and ways to get involved.
Especially up at Headingley Campus, sport is everywhere so you’re never too far away from getting involved.
Moving away to university is daunting for anyone and as scary as it may seem at first, having the new-found freedom and independence is great!
Having complete control over your time and what you do with it is amazing.
Now I admit, having freedom and independence isn’t especially exclusive just to Leeds Beckett but there are parts of Beckett that make this much easier.
This is for reasons such as: Leeds being such a student-orientated city, having great halls of residence on offer and Leeds also being a reasonably cheap city allowing you to get out and do things on a budget.
All this is helping Leeds grow into a Northern powerhouse which only increases the number of opportunities further.
And then there's also loads of opportunities specifically at Beckett.
I’m not going to sit and tell you every opportunity you can take advantage of at Beckett, but a quick look around their website can help to give you an idea at what there is to get involved with.
There's volunteer work, SU roles, paid work and sports to name just a few.
I’m from a small rural town so to have all these opportunities on my doorstep makes me realise just how much opportunity there is in Leeds and at Leeds Beckett.
I’m Ben, a final year Sport Marketing student.
Originally from Middlesbrough, I moved to Leeds when I started at Leeds Beckett.
I have two main passions, sport and modern technologies and look to combine the two whenever I can.

My favourite pastimes include creating content and travelling around the world and learning about different cultures.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/12/reasons-why-choosing-leeds-beckett-was-the-best-decision:
Hi, I’m Chloe, a Performing Arts student at Leeds Beckett and in this blog I’m going to tell you all about my experience at university and why I love it here.
I used to be set on the idea of not going to university but after talking to a friend who went to LBU, I became curious about the idea and decided it was an adventure I was excited to try.
Now, I am in my final year and it has been an experience I will never forget.
I have met so many amazing people, learnt about a new city and experienced a completely different environment from what I am used to.
Choosing Leeds Beckett was the best decision for me and my future.
I come from a small town in East Yorkshire and so moving to Leeds was extremely daunting as I didn’t have any experience of living in a city.
I had visited Leeds before but only briefly and I didn’t know anything about the area before moving.
When I arrived, I loved exploring and it was fun to figure out where everything was.
Now I don’t think twice about where I’m going as Leeds is a really easy city to navigate and most places are within walking distance.
The Beckett community is great.
When I first arrived, other students helped me find my footing and now with my increased confidence and knowledge I like to help people find their place too.
One of my favourite things about Leeds is how much variety there is on offer.
I love to find smaller places across the city to have a fun night, like performances and gigs in unique venues.
You don’t realise how much there actually is in Leeds until you experience it for yourself.
Before starting first year, I often heard people say that you make your closest friends at university, but I never thought it was true.
Now I feel like it’s safe to say, it’s true and I’ve met friends that I will never lose.
I have also become a lot closer with friends from college who also moved to Leeds for university and now we are talking about living together after we’ve graduated, which is exciting.
You build such strong relationships at uni because you all understand what everyone is going through, and people are always there to help each other wherever they can.
As well as making long lasting friendships, I’ve also experienced random moments of friendship, playing pool with other students on campus who I’ve not met before.
Even though I didn't bump into them again after that, they were some fun nights and they make me grateful for how welcoming and friendly everyone is.
When you are on campus you really do feel like you are part of a community and if you take part in societies, you meet people you usually wouldn’t have the chance to meet.
Going to university has presented me with opportunities I couldn’t even dream of before.
I have performed with Jack Whitehall at the First Direct Arena thanks to Leeds Beckett.
This is something I still find so surreal nearly a year later.

Hi, I'm Elettra and in this blog I will be sharing with you my thoughts about why Leeds Beckett University is a great place to study and why I am happy with the choice I made when deciding which university to go to.
Leeds Beckett has provided diversity and colour to my university experience.
It has allowed me to enjoy a social life and student experience as well as working on my degree which has enriched my overall experience.
Some of these experiences include going on International Cultural Exchange to St John’s University in New York City and spending a year in industry on placement in Spain.
The opportunities I have had to meet people with same interests and even international students with totally different cultural and educational backgrounds has been really eye opening.
Leeds Beckett allows students to benefit even more from their experience, thanks to the modern and well-equipped campuses, in Headingly and the City Centre.
I used to go to the gym on campus just before classes, and after I would stay at the library to work on the lectures and seminars I had on the day.
Due to the handy locations of the facilities on campus, it saved me a lot of time because I didn’t have to move from one place to another.
One thing I love about Beckett is the wide range of services available for students.
Students need various types of support, depending on where they come from, what their interests are and what they want to achieve, and the university recognises that.
I can’t think of any area of student support that has not been taken into consideration by Leeds Beckett to help students lives during their studies.
I found the university support very helpful during my application process.
I was in continuous contact with the Admissions team and have been in contact with many other helpful teams during my time here.
The Study Abroad team were really helpful when I was considering my options for the study exchange and the Placement team were there for me when I set up my work year.
The team I have accessed the most support from has been the Accommodation Team.
Before arriving in Leeds, they were extremely supportive and they managed to secure me a place in university halls, even though I was a late applicant.
I was very grateful for this support and they were very accommodating to my requests and needs.
It is so easy to access any learning and study material at Beckett.
Logging into our online student portal is straight forward and from there we can access learning resources, all necessary information about the course and each individual module.
Being familiar with accessing so much online and the easy to navigate systems has been very helpful during the pandemic.
Getting used to the new reality in my personal life is already overwhelming enough and so it helped me a lot to know that I already knew how to use the online systems for university.
I was able to quickly shift into the distance learning experience without too much trouble.
I also find that the support section of the student portal is a good tool.
There are some useful links dedicated to academic support, such as more in-depth learning materials and specific academic contact details.
Then there is also personal support resources, which provide advice on a large number of topics varying from student life and money, accommodation, wellbeing to disability, sexual misconduct and crisis contacts, Students' Union services and finally career opportunities and international student support.
Leeds Beckett is a very friendly, social environment where students can participate in activities and societies offered within the Students' Union as well as within individual schools.

Hi, I’m Mishani and in this blog I’ll be talking about how the support I received from Leeds Beckett made the first year at university as stress-free as possible.
It goes without saying that the academic aspect of university is vital, so when I arrived two weeks after the official start date I was slightly panicked.
I started to doubt if I’d ever be able to catch up, considering all the stories I’d heard about university professors and their rigid mindset towards education.
At Leeds Beckett, I found all of these to be nothing but myth.
All the lecturers were so overwhelmingly helpful that I sailed through the first semester with no problems.
From directing me to the right resources, to helping me catch up on lost work and providing helpful additional course material, they truly helped expand my knowledge on the subject without being overbearing.
I can go on and on about the support provided by the library at Leeds Beckett.
From staff helping you find the books that best complement your course material, to assisting you with queries regarding library loans and extra resources, the Sheila Silver library at LBU is a fantastic place to find study material.
Each course at LBU is assigned an academic librarian (as stated in each student’s course handbook).
They are available to help you with course-specific details, which I was very grateful for.
This process ensures that you receive advice from someone who specialises in your chosen subject, eliminating the stress of finding credible work to supplement your studies.
In addition to this, I find that they go the extra mile by replying to my email queries within a short period of time and they are available whenever I have needed them.
One instance where I truly felt supported was when a professor offered to individually go over the session with me as I had arrived late due to issues with public transport.
I left this class feeling more confident in my decision to choose LBU than I had ever before.
A guidance system like this is what makes the student support at Leeds Beckett quite incomparable.
I think it's their attention to student’s needs and understanding for different circumstances that defines their approach to providing a great university experience.
When you’re constantly rushing from one class to another and focusing on staying on top of your assignments, it’s easy to forget about looking after your mental health.
I’ve found that it’s important to take the time to evaluate your routine and adapt a healthy lifestyle, that includes talking to others about how you feel.
LBU provides free counselling sessions to all students.
The Student Wellbeing Team counselling service is incredibly helpful, professional and is accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).
They maintain complete confidentiality and aspire to help you find positive ways to cope with stress, anxiety and other mental health problems.
Specific information regarding mental health support provided by the team can be found on the Student Wellbeing page .
In addition to this, for those who may be uncomfortable with face-to-face help, they provide free access to an online mental wellbeing platform called Kooth.
I stumbled across Kooth on one of the informative posters around campus and decided to give it a go.
It is designed especially for students and is run by professionals, making it one of the best help systems I’ve found out there.
As someone who uses Kooth regularly to help regulate day-to-day emotions, I can vouch for its effectiveness and the support it provides.
In addition to providing hourly sessions to discuss your mental health, counsellors often check in with a message to follow up on your discussion and see how you're doing, which means a lot if you’re like me and often forget to keep in contact.
Leeds Beckett has worked hard to support me during my time at university, and I can safely say that they have gone above and beyond in doing so.
From the efficient library system and encouraging professors, to online mental health support and the wellbeing team, all aspects of support that I have needed has been taken care of which has enabled me to achieve my highest potential at university.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/12/how-my-time-at-leeds-beckett-has-benefited-me:
Hi, I’m Eliza and in this blog I’m going to be telling you how choosing to study at Leeds Beckett was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.
This is my last year of university and I’m silently hoping it won’t fly by as fast as the first two have.
I love being a student at Beckett, in part because I am a very academic person who’s always enjoyed school, but also because I sometimes look back at who I was when I first moved to Leeds and can’t believe how much I’ve grown.
First-year me was shy, socially anxious and ready to hide in the darkest corner of a lecture theatre to avoid interacting with others.
At the start my course was confusing and felt alien to me.
It made me doubt myself and my choices and I started to feel silly for getting into something I had no real idea about.
Fast-forward two years, and here I am.
I’ve found the perfect career choice in my field of study, I’m keeping up with my course requirements and I’m socialising and working well with my course mates with little hesitation.
It is an exciting, rewarding and transforming experience.
University is a learning experience but is not limited to studying.
It has taught me more about myself than I’d ever hoped to figure out this early in my life.
It’s given me strength and showed me that I can achieve so much more than I’d thought realistically possible.
Being a student has thrown me into a foreign country and environment, pushed me to adapt to various social situations, make friends, choose my career goals and create a clear picture of what I want my future to look like.
Student life is a self-discovery journey, created inside a safe, supportive environment where you can easily fail or make mistakes, without any judgement.
If someone had told me that by the age of 22, I would find my dream professional goal, learn such valuable skills like shorthand, TV presenting or producing broadcast shows, I would have laughed in their face.
But now I’m here, having done all that and more.
Every time I learn a new skill here or try a new experience, I’m moving closer to becoming a graduate who has a fully formed idea about where to go once I leave the protective university environment.
Leeds Beckett has helped ease me into the working world, get a taste for the job market and has expanded my goals and skills.
Without experiencing student life and university I would have struggled to find a clear route through life.
Where I come from, it’s not part of our culture to find work from a young age.
I got my first job at 20 years old, while a lot of my colleagues were as young as 16.
This is why for me personally, it would have been a disaster to try and build my life straight out of high school.
Going to university was always the right choice, since it allowed me to become so much more mature and confident.
I’ve gone from being someone who barely knew how to build a CV, to someone who is now successfully juggling a part-time job, freelancing, studies and working towards a visible goal.
From a person who could barely start a conversation to a person who constantly asks strangers for interviews and is actively involved in communities of journalists and freelancers.
I love being a student and I’d love for it to last a little longer.
Without coming to Leeds Beckett, I would never have been this ready for the next stage in life.
Hi, I'm Eliza and I study Journalism.

More information about studying a postgraduate degree
Why study a postgraduate course?
According to the latest Graduate Labour Market Statistics, released in 2018, postgraduates earn an average of £6,000 more than their undergraduate counterparts, while 97.7% of Leeds Beckett postgraduates are in work or further study six months after graduating.
A big part of being a postgraduate student is making great connections and lasting relationships that could help you in the future.
Whether it’s like-minded students, members of the teaching team, or guest lecturers, creating a valuable network to support you in your career can be one of the most rewarding experiences of further study and, when it comes to finding a job, help you get your foot in the door.
On top of this, a postgraduate qualification is much more than proof that you have specialist knowledge in your field – it is also evidence of determination, persistence and intellectual ability, all of which will help to ensure you recognise and pursue all of the personal and professional growth opportunities that come your way.
What are the main differences between undergraduate and postgraduate?
The duration and levels of difficulty vary depending on the type of degree you may be after - postgraduate certificates or diplomas, for example, are shorter and less demanding than a master's course.
However, all of our qualifications expand on the knowledge you have learned during your undergraduate degree and are designed to improve your career prospects.
It is common for postgraduate students to invest more time in their studies – from reading research to conducting your own, you can expect to be more involved with the academic side of student life than the social side of it.
Classes are smaller in student numbers, which means that you are able to engage more with group discussions, as well as build a closer working relationship with your tutors and benefit from their support.
For students progressing straight onto a postgraduate course from their undergraduate degree, studying full-time tends to be the preferred option.
While for students returning to university, who may now have work or family commitments, most courses are also available on a part-time basis to help make study more accessible.
Perks of postgraduate study
Many students choose a postgraduate course that follows on from their first degree, meaning you will be able to learn more about something you’re interested in.
You will also get the opportunity to to dig further into a particular area of a subject you enjoy and take your knowledge to the next level.
You will have the chance to explore new concepts, break new territory and contribute new knowledge to your chosen field, instead of mainly learning about and reviewing existent theories.
In contrast, some students also decide to take their studies in a different direction and learn something completely new, broadening their knowledge and career options.
It’s completely up to you.
With more than 190 courses available – you’ve certainly got plenty of choice.
If you study a master's, working on your dissertation is another aspect of postgraduate study that you can look forward to.
As well as further developing your research, analysis and writing, it’s an opportunity to embrace and become an expert in a topic that interests you.
Government loans up to £12,858 are also available for many of our master's courses and work in a very similar ways to the undergraduate loan scheme.

It’s also important not to compare yourself to other students on the course, everyone is going at their own pace and everybody reaches the same goals at the end of the term.
Try not to burn yourself out, rest is just as important as studying.
As Robert Collier says, “success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.”
No way!
My first degree was in Spanish and Linguistics and I went on to study MSc Speech and Language therapy.
If you find a course you’re interested in, you can find more information about the course on the Leeds Beckett website, or, you can find contact details such as an email address or a phone number to ask for specific advice about your eligibility.
Y our undergraduate course must relate to your postgraduate course in some way, for example, my link was studying linguistics.
However, if there is no link between your undergraduate course and your postgraduate course, further guidance may be needed about how you can apply for that specific course.
More information about applying to a postgraduate course can be found here .
This is not true.
My postgraduate course has similar funding to my undergraduate degree, whereby I apply for student finance on Student Finance England each year and that loan pays for my course and I don’t have to worry about the payment instalments as they are released automatically.
When I start work and I earn over a certain amount of money, I will then repay my loan each month.
More information about funding a postgraduate course can be found here as there are different loans to choose from .
This could be the furthest from the truth.
A master’s degree can transform your career!
My master’s degree will qualify me to work as a health professional and will enable me to excel in my career in the NHS.
Without this master’s course, I would NOT be able to apply for a health professional role.
Absolutely not!
Once you find a postgraduate course you’re interested in, you can find out what degree classification is required to apply for the course, Leeds Beckett for example allowed 2:2 and above onto my course.
Even if you don’t have the desired degree classification, you can still ask university what other options may be available to you.
Life is all about balance and you are the master (pardon the pun) of your work schedule, therefore you can manage your studies however it suits you.
It’s important to make time for your studies as well as spending time with your friends and family to ensure that you look after your mental wellbeing and don’t burn yourself out.
This is false.
You will receive your timetable in advance therefore you can plan part-time work around your schedule.
Many jobs are flexible for students, and if you can choose a part-time job or volunteer in a setting that compliments your course, that is a great opportunity to further enhance your experience, your confidence, and your CV.
Master courses can be competitive, and it is important to make your application as strong as you can and be prepared for an interview.
I'm sure Leeds Beckett would love to take everyone on board, but the reality is that there are limited spaces on certain courses.
However, I think it is ALWAYS worth applying, no matter how many other people do, because even if you don’t get onto the course, the experience of the application process and going for an interview is so beneficial to learn from, if you decide to apply again.
I hope that I have managed to put you at ease when you come to deciding whether a postgraduate course is the right path for you.
You will hear a lot of myths from people who have never even gone on to do further study, but I wanted to let you know that these myths are false.
From my experience, a postgraduate degree was the best decision I have ever made as it has put me on the career path that I want to be on, and I will be so proud of all of my effort when I graduate.
It may not be easy, but it’ll definitely be worth it.
Hi, I’m Ellen a second year masters student studying Speech and Language Therapy at Leeds Beckett.
I have lived abroad in Madrid and I am fluent in Spanish.

Hello, my name is Ross, I am currently studying the MSc Sports Events Management course held at Headingley Campus.
The transition from being an undergrad student to being a master’s student during COVID-19 has been an eyeopener on a variety of levels.
With my graduation ceremony not taking place due to the pandemic, I was in two minds of where my life was going with the lack of jobs on offer.
With Beckett offering me a conditional offer for their Sports Events Management course, it allowed me to utilise this year of my life by exceeding my own expectations and learning more within the industry.
The opportunity to develop my own understanding and obtain the knowledge of elite events managers, who have guided me to the best possible position I could be, providing me with the motivation needed to be a master’s student on the full-time course.
The industry after COVID-19 will gradually revive and get back onto its own feet; I have the opportunity to get ahead of the competitors and come in as the highest qualified candidate for the role.
After finishing the first semester of the MSc course, I have thoroughly enjoyed the assignments and the depth of research I have had to go into to obtain the literature I needed for the assessments.
In comparison with having all of my lectures and seminars in my undergrad last year being in person, I have experienced having much more online learning and one session at university a week.
Ensure you are going to all the lectures or seminars on offer to you, along with having the work complete from the week before so you can keep on top of the assessment assigned to you.
The lecturers have taken all of their experience within the industry and cemented it into the literature provided to you within the course; the things I’ve learnt along my Leeds Beckett journey, I will ensure I use for a lifetime.
With the lack of face-to-face tuition time on offer with COVID-19, this has allowed me to improve my independent learning ability and faith in my own work instead of relying on the tutors to regularly put me in the right direction.
On MSc Sports Events Management, the modules are taught individually and not running alongside.
This new format has allowed me to spend more time on the assignment we have to hand in at the end of the six-week teaching period, which gave me the chance to take my time to do more independent learning within the specific topic.
This has allowed to relax and identify exactly what I need to do for my assessment and ensure I am delivering the correct content, which will obtain the highest grade possible.
Along with my master’s degree at Leeds Beckett University, I am also a member of the BUCS Rugby Union teams, which provided me an unlimited number of social opportunities to meet some great people and make long standing friendships.
For anybody looking to join Leeds Beckett and unsure if joining a society will make a difference to your university experience, I could not recommend it more highly!
Leeds Beckett Rugby Union changed my experience for the better and I would not change it for the world.
In conclusion to this blog, Leeds Beckett is a fantastic university and the things I have learnt I will cherish for a lifetime.
I would highly recommend that anyone joining takes every opportunity given to you and create the experience you have been given by coming to university.
Be the person you have always wanted to be and never doubt the choices you make during your university journey; you will not regret it!
Hi there, my name is Ross.
I’m a postgrad student studying Sports Events Management.
I am heavily interested in my rugby and cricket, as well as representing and captaining the university 5s in the BUCS Leagues.
I am also the Chairman of a Rugby Club located in Leeds.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/06/how-my-masters-has-helped-my-career:
I graduated from Leeds Beckett last year after studying BSc (Hons) Nutrition and then I progressed onto MSc Dietetics in September.
After graduating from BSc (Hons) Nutrition, I came out as a qualified nutritionist with a registration with the Association for Nutrition (AfN) – a voluntary regulator for nutritionists and nutrition scientists in the UK.
This meant that I am now qualified to provide evidence-based information about food and healthy eating.
Dietetics is the application of nutritional science to the development of diets and food selection and preparation in both health and disease.
A dietetics degree is the only route to qualifying as a dietitian in the UK.
They are approved by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and are accredited with the British Dietetic Association (BDA).
Dietitians are qualified and regulated healthcare professionals that assess, diagnose, and treat dietary and nutritional problems.
They work with both well and unwell patients, providing them with personalised support based on their lifestyle and medical history.
Registered nutritionist’s and registered dietitians are both educated in biochemistry, physiology, applied sciences, research methods, and social and behavioural sciences, however, their scope of practice varies.
Once graduated, a registered nutritionist can provide support around healthy eating, but they are restricted in that they cannot provide information on special diets for medical conditions (i.e.
renal diet).
A dietitian, on the other hand, has access to patient medical records and can provide treatment for patients with medical conditions.
Before starting university, I had a growing interest for nutrition and eating disorders.
Whilst my passion for both of these continued to grow, I realised that I wanted to pursue a career within this area.
When I looked into how I can achieve this, I discovered that I must become a registered dietitian to work with individuals with eating disorders.
With this in mind, I looked into the entrance requirements for BSc (Hons) Dietetics and realised that I lacked the chemistry A-level which they required.
This was not a problem to me, as I was happy to apply for BSc (Hons) Nutrition and then choose a different pathway to achieve a career I desired.
As I was a mature student when I began first year (23 years old), I was eager to begin my career ASAP.
I wanted to find alternate ways that I could work with people who have disordered eating without having to study another 4-year undergraduate degree.
I was aware of add-on courses that enabled me to work with some individuals, however, I still needed more guidance.
I arranged a meeting with an eating disorder specialist dietitian (a fantastic and highly admirable dietetic lecturer at Beckett) and expressed my interests.
The dietetic lecturer advised that my best option is to study the postgraduate dietetic course.
It was quite an empowering moment when I thought to myself, am I actually going to do this?
Did I just decide I am going to apply for a postgraduate?
And that was it, it changed my whole career path and essentially my whole life.
Now I am studying dietetics, I am enjoying the whole journey as well as excited for what the future holds.
This course has provided me with more opportunity than what my UG did, even if I chose to do the ‘add-on’ courses.
Once I graduate, I won’t be able to work with individuals with eating disorders just yet, but by undertaking this PG, it has given me the initial stepping-stone towards the next chapter of my career in dietetics.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/distance-learning/what-is-distance-learning:
Very simply, to study by distance learning means you don't have to be based in Leeds to take one of our courses.
Wherever you are and whatever you want to study, it's a great option for flexible learning.
When you choose one of our distance learning courses, you can do just that – study at a distance, at a pace that suits you.
Like our students on campus, you will have the same excellent teaching and learning resources, however you'll find these online instead of in a lecture theatre.
Not only are the modules taught online but you will also have access to an online community and more than 140,000 books and journals in our online library.
Our extensive list of distance learning courses means that whether you are from the UK or further afield, changing your career path or looking for that promotion, we have a course that suits your needs.
Distance Learning at Leeds Beckett
We've been running distance learning courses at Leeds Beckett for many years and welcome students across the world - from Yorkshire to Botswana and Trinidad to Germany.
Our specialist staff help to ensure our distance learning students have a great education and experience.
We ensure that:
Benefits of distance learning Distance learning is a great way to progress further in your career - you can balance the demands of your course with your everyday commitments, allowing you to keep working while you learn.
You don't have to come on to campus to attend lectures and seminars, so you won’t have to worry about relocating.
You'll have the option to study at home, in a library, in a coffee shop - or even on the bus.
In fact if you can access the internet, you can access everything you need for our distance learning courses.
Some of our distance learning courses have additional start dates throughout the year, giving you added options.
Any qualification you earn by distance learning is of equal value to one obtained studying on campus.
You can use other university libraries, so you’ll have the benefit of learning resources close to where you live.
Support while you study
We put a lot of time and effort into ensuring you have a great experience with us.
All distance learning students are given an induction programme and course handbook, which specifies exactly what is expected from you - and what you can expect from us.
Just because you aren't learning on campus doesn't mean you'll have to cope on your own - you'll have the support of a module tutor along with the university's Student Hub and Wellbeing Centre.
They are on hand to offer you advice about everything from academic issues to stress and anxiety.
Whilst studying a distance learning qualification it can sometimes be difficult to balance your study time with both your personal life and work obligations.
We will support you through these times by providing advice on time management, organisational techniques and the importance of two-way communication not only with your peers but also other students studying your course.
Tools  for learning
Our students log in to a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) instead of attending lectures or seminars in person.
The VLE gives you access to course materials such as videos, ebooks and other documents.
You also use it to submit your assignments and to receive feedback.
As well as the VLE you'll communicate with us through our online library, online forums, Skype conference calls and email.
Some of our courses give you the opportunity to access podcasts, blogs and an on-campus learning weekend.

After serving nearly 17 years in the army as an officer, Ros Kearney decided to change her career path by starting a Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) at Leeds Law School.
Read her story below.
"My first career was in the army as an officer in the Royal Logistic Corps.
I spent nearly 17 years in the British Army and reached the rank of Major.
I did tours of Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.
When I left, my children were still very young, so I spent a few years being a full-time mum until last year when I decided it was time for a change.
I am also married to a soldier, which meant I struggled to get meaningful employment.
I would get to a final interview, only to be told that despite being the best candidate, I couldn’t have the job as I could not guarantee staying long enough.
This really frustrated me, so I decided to use some remaining education funding I had from the Army to part-fund my GDL at Leeds Beckett.
Ros during her army career
Distance learning really suits me.
I can do it around the family (my husband is away a lot and I have the children to manage too).
I also work part-time at a gym, which helps fund the remainder of the GDL.
I have all the support I need and recently set up a remote social group with other law students, so we can socialise and support each other remotely.
We share our frustrations, tips, advice and random GIFs to keep each other motivated and on track.
It has helped us all a great deal, especially at the more pressured times around exams and assessment deadlines.
We even meet up for social zooms to ‘decompress’ after exams, which has been a lot of fun.
I truly feel like I’ve made some fabulous friends from all over the world since starting the course at Leeds Beckett.
The team at the Law School are always on hand through MS Teams to answer any questions.
The lectures are all pre-recorded so we can listen to them at any time (such as cooking supper or walking the dog), and there are interactive activities that we receive feedback on too.
The timetables are set out clearly in advance so there are no surprises along the way.
It is a very stress-free way of studying, which fits in neatly around other commitments.
Whilst I am only really at the start of my law career journey, and there are many more hurdles to jump over, I am confident that the teaching and support I am receiving from the team at Leeds Beckett will stand me in great stead when I embark on the next stages of my journey, hopefully to become a solicitor."
Ros Kearney is a student at Leeds Law School.

Hi, I'm Maia and I wanted to talk to you about my experience being a part of Leeds Beckett's surf club.
Surfing has always been a passion of mine and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to surf throughout my time at university.
I was keen to join a surfing club before I arrived as it was a sport I had fallen in love with during my time in Australia prior to university.
So, I got in contact with Leeds Beckett's surf club through their Facebook page in my first week here, and I signed up on the surf stand at Freshers Fair.
The club is not just professionals - there were many individuals wanting to sign up at Freshers Fair who had never surfed before and wanted to try something new.
At the beginning of the year we hold an event called 'Foamie Fest' which is where all members participate in a free surf lesson in Scarborough as an opportunity for everyone to get to know each other.
It is open to any ability, so whether it is someone’s first try or they are very experienced, everybody is welcome.
After this, there are regular trips throughout the year to Cayton Bay and Scarborough North Bay so that we can get in the water and get surfing.
Some people are surprised that Leeds Beckett has a surfing club seeing as Leeds isn't near the coast, however Scarborough is only about an hour and a half away.
As well as surfing in the UK, we also go abroad.
Every year (during January’s Refreshers Week) we take a winter trip abroad and we choose a different destination each time.
Our most recent adventure was to Morocco where 25 of us went to Taghazout for a week.
We had a beautiful rooftop balcony and surfed on some of the world’s best beaches.
A highlight of the trip was exploring Moroccan markets, cliff jumping in Paradise Valley and skating down sand dunes in the desert.
Another adventure the club had was when we travelled down to Newquay for the annual BUCS competition.
Only a handful of members competed but it was a fantastic weekend to practice surfing and support your friends.
As well as the surfing, the club all get together for social events too.
We hold fancy dress socials every couple of weeks and there's always a new theme.
We also organise dry socials for those who do not wish to drink alcohol which are really fun.
Recently we went to Laserzone (lazer quest) followed by a dinner at Nandos.
These socials mean our team is really inclusive and open to everyone, as we know sometimes people are afraid that sports clubs or societies can involve a lot of drinking.
As social secretary and the first female captain of the club, I have learned to become more organised.
This has come in handy, especially when booking venues for socials and arranging transport to and from day trips.
This is a skill I have utilised in all aspects of my student life from managing assignments to my part time job and I hope to develop it further in the future.
I would definitely recommend joining a society at university because you meet people you wouldn’t cross paths with otherwise.
We have all become so close that I would go as far as to say that your society becomes like your second family and is a great addition to university life.

Societies are a great way of meeting like-minded people who like taking part in similar activities to yourself.
There are societies for anything from climbing to ethical hacking, so chances are, they will be a society for you.
Societies have regular meet-ups and social events to get involved in.
Another bonus is that often, they’re very cheap to be a part of.
If for whatever reason there isn’t a society that you fancy already up and running then feel free to set one up yourself through the Student's Union.
All you need is two other people, so you can all fill the roles of president, secretary and treasurer and you’re good to go!
Check out all the societies that Leeds Beckett already has on offer here: www.leedsbeckettsu.co.uk/groups .
Now this one might sound obvious, but it can often be overlooked.
There’s no better way to get involved than with those who you’re already surrounded by.
When you move in, in September, everybody is in the same boat.
Everybody is feeling the exact same as you (probably nervous and eager to make friends) so making an effort and socialising is a sure-fire way of getting involved in as much as you can during your time at uni.
Chances are, you’ll be friends with who you meet in halls throughout uni and beyond so getting involved with them from as soon as you move in is never a bad idea.

This includes a simple reporting system, a first response support team, and processes to follow through with whatever action is necessary – all in place to ensure that we sustain a culture whereby individuals are able to raise concerns about bullying and harassment, confident that their issues will be dealt with appropriately, consistently, fairly and without fear of ridicule or victimisation.

The university provides mops, buckets, and brushes for you to use within your flat.
While the university will clean the shared areas of the building, maintaining the shared areas within your flat and individual rooms is your responsibility.
If your flat isn't cleaned to a reasonable standard, you would be in breach of your licence agreement.
Here are some suggestions that can help to maintain cleanliness:
Inspections occur around three times a year.
If you fail to comply with your licence agreement, inspections may become more frequent.
You'll receive at least 48 hours notice before an inspection.
Ensure your room and flat are up to the required standard during these times.
You're responsible for your own laundry as an additional cost to you.
On-site laundry facilities are available, and you'll receive more information about them upon arrival.
The University is responsible for repair and maintenance of the building, and are permitted to charge for damages where a student is in breach of the terms of their license agreement .
The University will clean the shared areas of the building, but not the shared areas within a flat or individual rooms — these areas are the responsibility of the people who use them.
If you or a flatmate become aware of any damage within the flat, it is important to report this as soon as possible on the grounds of health and safety and for repair.
It's important to take responsibility for any damage if it was caused by you or your guests.
Otherwise other residents could be charged for communal damage unfairly.
There are obvious risks associated with having a party within your flat— damage is more likely to occur, and you could then be in breach of your licence and face charges for the damage.
Any guests are your responsibility according to the Student Code of Conduct.
It is worth checking with Halls Management about particular restrictions on  parties at your residence.
We discourage advertising parties publicly—especially on the internet, as you will be responsible for everyone at your party.
Don’t invite anyone who you don’t know.
If you have a TV in the communal area or your bedroom, you must obtain a valid TV licence.
Watching or downloading BBC programmes on iPlayer also requires a licence.
The university arranges licences for TVs in common rooms outside flats.
The Standard Terms and Conditions of Residence do not allow you to make alterations to your room.
Please don’t redecorate it, put up shelves or strip lighting, fix aerials or satellite dishes, alter the wiring or plumbing, put additional locks on your door or make any other alterations.
If you do, you will be in breach of your licence agreement and could be liable for the costs of putting the room back to its original condition.
Feel free to use non-marking sticky stuff for posters.
If your posters leave marks on the walls or furniture you could be charged for redecoration or replacement costs.
Removing furniture from your room or flat is not allowed.
The university may confiscate items that are unlawful or pose a risk to health, safety, or welfare.
You will typically be warned and asked to remove such items before they are confiscated.
Each flat has its own lockable post box and you will be given access details on arrival.
Please note that Royal Mail deliver all letters into these post boxes directly.
Large packages or items delivered by courier services will be signed for at the reception, which are available to collect during office hours.
Your halls reception team will advise on the arrangements for collecting large parcels from reception.
You may need to either download the app for your hall of residence, present a bar code for collection or show a form of personal ID to ensure that parcels are given to the correct resident.
We all understand that students like to celebrate and enjoy themselves, but it is important to remember the impact your behaviour may have on others around you.
If you plan on having a party or gathering, be considerate of your flatmates and let them know.
As a general rule, quiet hours operate from 23:00 to 07:00 Sunday to Thursday and between midnight and 08:00 on Friday and Saturday nights .
Please keep in mind that not everyone will be on the same schedule.
Just because you don't have early morning lectures, that doesn't mean nobody else does.
Please ensure you aren't disturbing those around you who are trying to study or sleep.
Noise can cause serious distress, and in some instances, excessive and constant noise can ruin a student's experience within halls.
If you are struggling with a constant noise problem, please don't hesitate to contact your 24/7 halls reception team in the first instance at the time that this noise is occurring.
They will be able to assist you and support to resolve the noise issue as soon as possible.
The contact details for your halls of residence, including out-of-hours contact details, can be found on our Safety and Security page .
If you would like to speak about any concerns you may have about the behaviour of other residents and would like assistance to mediate and resolve these concerns the Residence Life team can help.
Wi-Fi is provided to all flats free of charge as part of your rent and information on how to connect to WiFi will be provided shortly after your arrival.
All students are bound by the university's Policy and Procedures on the Appropriate Student Use of University Electronic Information and Communications Facilities and Services, as well as the university's Regulations for the Use of Institutional Learning and Information Services Facilities and Institutional IT Facilities.
The university may suspend internet access to your room if you contravene these policies or if you are in serious breach of the terms of your licence agreement.
Assist us in reducing landfill waste by properly disposing of waste and making use of the recycling facilities within your halls.
Each hall of residence has waste and recycling points, containing bins labelled for General Waste and Recycling.
Each flat kitchen has both General waste and Recycling bins.
Separate your general waste using black bags and use clear bags for recycling.
Check the labels of your food and drink packaging to see if they can be recycled, if so, you can also put the packaging straight into the recycling bin.
(Don't forget to wash out jars and tins before putting them into the recycling bins).
If you are unsure or have any questions, ask your reception team.
Living with others can be challenging.
Effective communication, mutual respect, consideration, and compromise are key to a harmonious living environment.
If disputes arise, we encourage you to try and resolve them yourselves in the first instance.
However, if you would benefit from talking things through first with an adviser for guidance and support or would prefer for us to mediate the Residence Life team are here to help.
Your personal possessions are insured under the Block Halls Scheme and the premium for the scheme is included in the rent.
If you need to make a claim please refer to the Terms and Conditions to make sure the policy is adequate for your needs.
You can find these terms and conditions on your accommodation portal .
We recommend that you examine this insurance to ensure it covers all of your needs.
If you have any items of high value (e.g.
a bicycle), it may be worth considering top-up cover.
Details of additional cover, and charges, are set out in the terms and conditions of insurance.

Moving into student accommodation is an exciting milestone, filled with new experiences and opportunities.
As you settle into your new home, it’s important to understand how the Leeds Beckett University Code of Conduct applies to you while you live here.
This guide will help you navigate the rules and expectations to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.
The Student Code of Conduct is designed to maintain a safe, respectful, and productive environment for all students.
It applies to every student, whether you live on-campus or off-campus.
You must comply with the Code, as well as the terms of your licence agreement.
By following the Code, you contribute to a positive community where everyone can thrive.
Living in university accommodation means you must adhere to both the Student Code of Conduct and the terms of your licence agreement.
Breaches of either can lead to sanctions, including fines and potentially termination of your accommodation agreement.
Always stay informed about the rules and make sure to follow them.
It's important to note that being under the influence of substances, including alcohol, is not an excuse for breaching the Code.
Any violation committed while intoxicated will still result in penalties.
Responsible behaviour is expected at all times to ensure everyone's safety.
Aggression towards staff or fellow students is taken very seriously and can lead to more severe sanctions.
Respectful and non-confrontational communication is crucial in maintaining a harmonious living environment.
If a university or accommodation staff member makes a reasonable request, you are expected to comply.
Ignoring or refusing such requests is considered an additional breach of the Code and can result in further consequences.
Here are some examples of breaches and their associated sanctions:
Tampering with smoke/heat detectors: Maximum fine of £100 Smoking in a non-designated area: Maximum fine of £100 Causing a fire: Maximum fine of £500
Damage to furniture and fittings: Payment to replace or fix Serious damage to property fittings: Maximum fine of £500
Use of inappropriate language: Maximum fine of £100 Harassment/bullying: Maximum fine of £500
Aggression towards staff/students: Maximum fine of £500 Possession of a weapon: Maximum fine of £500
Theft: Fine of up to £100 Lying to a staff member: Fine of up to £100
Unacceptable levels of noise: Warning Possession or use of illegal drugs: Maximum fine of £500, potential legal action
Your behaviour significantly impacts the community around you.
By following the Code of Conduct, you help create a safe and welcoming environment for yourself and your fellow residents.

Degree apprenticeships offer organisations a cost-effective way to develop your workforce, attract new talent and inject vitality into your business for sustainable growth and success.
Degree apprentices gain industry knowledge and practical, relevant experience which is uniquely tailored to your business, by combining on-the-job training with flexible study.
A degree apprenticeship is the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree (BA/BSc) or Master's degree qualification and takes up to four years to complete, studying part-time.
Funding degree apprenticeships has never been easier – organisations with a wage bill in excess of £3m can fund course fees using their apprenticeship levy and organisations under £3m can access up to 95% Government funding.
Further information on the apprenticeship levy and funding can be found on the Government website .

Degree apprentices can keep your business up to date with the latest techniques and technology, increasing your productivity for the future.
Fill your higher-level skills gaps
Higher-level skills are vital to business performance and economic growth.
Through degree apprentices you can fill your higher-level skills gaps efficiently and effectively by tailoring the learning.

If the annual pay bill of your organisation exceeds £3m you will pay for your apprenticeship training through your levy account.
Once you have exceeded the spend on your Levy account you will then move to the co-funded model where you will pay 5% of the cost and the Government will co-fund this by 95%.
If you are a non-levy paying organisation the Government will co-fund your degree apprenticeship training by contributing 95% of the costs and you will pay the remaining 5% of costs.
For further information on apprenticeship funding visit the Government's website.
You will be responsible for the recruitment of degree apprentices.
However, we can work with you to promote your opportunities via our website.

Graduating degree apprenticeship student, Alex Hobson was awarded ‘The 2022 Dean’s Prize for Excellence in Surveying & Architectural Technology’.
This prize is awarded to the graduate who has achieved the best performance overall across the Building Surveying, Quantity Surveying, Real Estate and Architectural Technology courses.
He also achieved the highest dissertation mark across all the quantity surveying graduates.
We caught up with Alex to ask why he chose to study the BSc (Hons) Quantity Surveying degree apprenticeship.
I didn’t want a job stuck behind the same desk all day every day, so was keen to look at opportunities where I could get out to different places and meet a variety of new people.
After completing my A-levels at 6th form in maths and business, combined with an interest in construction, a role in quantity surveying seemed like a great fit.
I started with Tilbury Douglas Construction Ltd seven years ago and enrolled on their apprenticeship scheme as an apprentice quantity surveyor.
The apprenticeship route was a clear choice for me, it enabled me to get into the workplace while also having a plan in place to obtain my academic qualifications.
The opportunity to earn a salary at the same time made the decision even easier.
Since joining, I have completed my Level 3 BTEC, HNC and HND qualifications combined with a level 3 and level 5 NVQ.
The chartered surveyor degree apprenticeship was the obvious next step in my progression and Leeds Beckett offered a great opportunity to enrol and complete the course.
Managing my work and study commitments has been difficult but rewarding at the same time.
Tilbury Douglas provide me with one day off the job training a week which allows me to attend lectures, seminars and also complete my coursework / exam revision.
On these days I always kept my work phone and emails turned off to prevent any distractions so I could concentrate on my studies.
Also, my colleagues and project team have been great in terms of appreciating my apprenticeship commitments, ensuring all key meetings and deadlines are arranged around my study day.
Time management was key to keep up to various deadlines, using my spare time when necessary, but it has definitely been worth it.
Due to the fast-paced nature of the course, it’s vital you keep on top of your course work to prevent things slipping.
Therefore it was my priority to get ahead early in terms of watching pre-recorded lectures and reading key module documents.
I have received a great amount of support from both my employer and the university.
They have provided me with the opportunity to develop my skills, knowledge and experience in both the workplace and academically.
Being on the apprenticeship scheme has allowed me to gain the best of both worlds - I learn theory from the university modules which I then put it into practice in my day-to-day job.
As I have progressed through my apprenticeship, I have been trusted with greater levels of responsibility, which has pushed my development even further.
I have recently been promoted to a Quantity Surveyor role where I am now supported to manage my own projects and frameworks.
I have also had regular meetings with the university to ensure that I am on track to achieve my end point assessment, whilst also offering guidance and assistance to check that I am getting the most out of the course.
I have really enjoyed all the modules I completed throughout the course, they offered varied insights into different elements of the Quantity Surveying role, from contemporary issues within industry, economic modelling techniques and contract law.
These also all presented different challenges with various assessment types, such as assignments, presentations and exams which kept the course interesting and engaging.
Although it was a huge challenge, the dissertation module was also very enjoyable as this gave me the opportunity to complete a full research project which expanded my thoughts and skills in terms of approaching and looking at solutions towards a current issue within the construction industry.
If you are interested in a career within the construction industry, investigate the various degree apprenticeship routes available.
In my opinion, the combination of on the job and academic training is invaluable.
As you are learning the role first-hand, I believe this puts you in a more favorable position when you graduate as you already have years of experience behind you which you can utilise to progress your career.
I would also recommend that you do your research before committing to a course, speak to people who have previously completed different routes and fully understand the requirements of the end point assessment.
This will help you decide if an apprenticeship is right for you and give you a greater understanding of the commitment it involves.
As there are various options available, by doing this you may find one which is more suited to your job role compared to others, which will help when capturing your work-based experience.

This week is National Apprenticeship Week, a week-long celebration that brings together businesses and apprentices across the country to shine a light on the positive impact that apprenticeships make to individuals, businesses and the wider community.
Leeds Beckett University offers a number of apprenticeships across its schools and we’re going to find out more about the Trainee Nursing Associate which is offered in the School of Health.
Tom Riley, who is now an Associate Lecturer at Leeds Beckett, completed his degree apprenticeship (DA) in 2021 and has been telling us about his experience.
“I started working at Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust in 2015 as a clinical support worker in haematology.
I always felt I needed to do more for the patients and wanted to understand individuals’ psychological and physiological reactions to their health problems.
I became frustrated due to my lack of knowledge in my capacity as a clinical support worker as I felt I could make a difference in supporting people in a more in-depth position.
One evening on the ward, when we were caring for a critically ill patient, a doctor remarked that I had a calm and reassuring manner towards the patient.
On reflection of that incident, I decided to enrol on the Trainee Nursing Associate (TNA) apprenticeship in 2019.”
“I choose Leeds Beckett University because it offered the excellent support with my dyslexia, and I lived and worked in Leeds so fitted well with my studies.
”
“During my TNA course I did my training on the Oncology ward.
Here I gained communication skills working with the multi-disciplinary team and with patients and their families.
The challenges within my training were the academic work and overcoming my dyslexia on a daily basis.
Fortunately, the university supported me by highlighting different techniques to use which assisted with my assignments and exams.”
“I qualified in 2021 and became a Registered Nurse Associate in oncology where I stayed for 18 months before applying for a secondment position as a Learning Facilitator within the Pre-registration Education Team – I have a passion to assist individuals overcome their fears and challenges in training and achieve their goals.
In 2023, I applied for the secondment of an Associate Lecturer at Leeds Beckett as I felt I could pass on my experiences to the TNAs and support them with any difficulties.
Working in this role, I have identified that most TNAs did not have any knowledge regarding their future developmental routes, therefore I am disseminating different routes for their career progression.
My future aspiration is to continue within higher education by supporting and shaping the NHS for the future.”
Developed in partnership with local health care providers, the FdSc Nursing Associate Apprenticeship has been designed to offer organisations a flexible pathway for apprentices to achieve the requirements for the generic Nursing Associate Practitioner.
Nursing Associates work with healthcare support workers and registered nurses to deliver care for patients and the public.

The Policy sets out the procedure for making a whistleblowing disclosure and how this will be considered and investigated, as well as the legal protections afforded to complainants under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.
Roles and responsibilities
The Board of Governors has designated the Audit Committee as the body which will oversee the proper conduct of investigations of whistleblowing disclosures and ensure that the provisions of the Policy are properly applied.
The Audit Committee has appointed the Registrar & Secretary as the Designated Officer who will act as a single point of contact for staff to go to if they wish to raise concerns.
The Designated Officer will consider complaints made and is responsible for invoking the Policy where deemed appropriate, and overseeing any procedures and decisions taken under the Whistleblowing Policy, though they may consult relevant senior colleagues in reaching a conclusion.
The Designated Officer will keep the member of staff raising the concern informed about the investigation and its outcome.
Independent support and advice
Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work) are leading experts in whistleblowing and can provide independent, confidential support and guidance for individuals on matters relating to whistleblowing disclosures.

If you’re not sure where to begin, our Career Choices information is a really useful place to start.
You can look at different career options based on your degree, skills, interests and motivations.
Many employers will recruit graduates from a wide variety of degree subjects, so it’s worth exploring all your options, even if there doesn’t seem to be a clear link with your degree.
Over the course of your studies you’ll develop a broad range of transferrable skills which will be relevant to lots of different roles.
Careers are built over a number of years, and throughout your working life it’s increasingly common to have several careers, working in different roles and industries.

These include:
A structured training programme, generally 1-2 years in length, usually working for a large employer and gaining experience in different parts of the organisation.
You often need to apply for these in the Autumn term before starting the following summer.
The majority of graduate employers offer these type of roles, so there’s opportunity to work for both large or small organisations.
You’ll apply to work in a specific role at the organisation and this might be on a fixed or permanent contract.
You would generally apply for these roles in your final semester as recruitment timeframes can be quite quick.
Freelancing or starting your own business is another option to you as a graduate.
You can also consider a portfolio career - a mixture of employed and self-employed work, which can offer a blend of security and flexibility.
If you’re interested in postgraduate study, a career in academia might be something you could explore in the future.
Academic roles can be very different depending on your skills, experience and place of work.
Some may have a teaching focus, a research focus or a mix of both.
You can also use your transferrable skills to work outside of academia.
We provide lots of support in searching and applying for graduate jobs .

Deciding whether to take a placement year is a huge decision for any university student, I wrestled with the same choice during my time at Leeds Beckett.
Some students see it as a golden opportunity to gain hands-on experience, while others worry about delaying graduation and stepping out of the academic routine.
So, is a placement year worth it?
Let me share my experience and thoughts to help you make a decision.
One of the biggest advantages of a placement year is the real-world experience it gives you in your field of study.
It’s one thing to learn about a subject in lectures and seminars, but applying that knowledge in a professional environment is a completely different challenge.
I realised this when I secured a legal internship at a law firm.
I had assumed that my coursework had prepared me well, but stepping into a real legal setting was eye-opening.
It wasn’t just about knowing the law, it was about applying it in high-pressure situations, working with clients, and handling unexpected challenges.
This experience completely changed my perspective.
Working in the firm helped me understand what the job truly involved, and more importantly, it made me realise how much I still had to learn.
Without this experience, I might have gone into the field with unrealistic expectations.
A placement year doesn’t just build your skills, it also expands your professional network.
Before my internship, I didn’t fully appreciate the power of networking until I attended a law careers event at Leeds Beckett.
At first, I felt completely out of place.
Everyone around me seemed so confident, effortlessly making conversation.
But after pushing myself to engage with professionals, I quickly realised how valuable these interactions were.
One solicitor I spoke to explained that many job opportunities don’t come from formal applications but from personal connections and recommendations.
That conversation stuck with me, and it made me more proactive about networking moving forward.
One thing that isn’t talked about enough is the adjustment of transitioning back to university life after a placement year.
While it can take some time to get back into academic routines, the skills and confidence gained during a placement often make the transition easier in the long run.
After my placement, I initially felt a little out of sync with coursework, but I soon realised that the discipline and time management I had developed during my internship helped me regain focus more quickly than I expected.
The practical experience I gained gave me a new perspective on my studies, making my coursework feel more relevant and engaging.
If anything, my placement experience helped me approach university with a renewed sense of motivation and direction.
It’s also important to remember that placement opportunities can be highly competitive.
Even if you’re eager to gain work experience, securing a spot isn’t guaranteed.
I experienced this firsthand when I applied for a training contract with a different law firm as well as a placement position.
I spent weeks perfecting my CV and cover letters, making sure my applications were as strong as possible.
Despite my best efforts, I received rejection emails from both opportunities.
It was frustrating — I knew I had the potential, but so did hundreds of other applicants.
This taught me that while placements can be incredibly valuable, they’re not always easy to secure, and rejection is part of the process.
It also showed me my resilience and persistence, I didn't let rejection put me off or take it personally - I continued to apply until I was accepted for a placement year at another firm.
Throughout my time preparing for the placement, I found that the Beckett Careers Team was an invaluable resource.
They helped me with everything from refining my CV and cover letters to providing interview tips and connecting me with alumni.
The team also organised career fairs and events that gave me the opportunity to meet potential employers and gain insights into the industries I was interested in.
Their support made all the difference in securing my placement and staying on track.
If you’re considering a placement year, I highly recommend reaching out to them - they can provide guidance and resources that will make the process much smoother.
If you’re considering a placement year, here are a few key questions to ask yourself:
What are my career goals?
Some fields (like engineering, business, and healthcare) place a strong emphasis on work experience, while others may not.
Is the placement paid?
If not, do I have the financial stability to support myself?
Can I reach out to students who have done a placement year to hear about their experiences?
Talking to people who have been through it can provide invaluable insight into whether it’s the right choice for you.
A placement year can be a great way to boost your career, but it’s not the right choice for everyone.
It’s important to weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks, such as the difficulty of securing a placement and the challenge of returning to university afterward.
Ultimately, the decision should align with your career goals, financial situation, and personal learning style.
For me, my placement was a turning point, it gave me clarity about my career and invaluable experience that I couldn’t have gained in a lecture hall.
But every student’s journey is different, so take the time to figure out what’s best for you!

The assertion of ‘dreams come true’ always bangs in the thoughts, until this comes to a reality.
Securing an academic opportunity to pursue a Masters at Leeds Beckett University was not just that thought, but a carefully considered decision that aligned with my personal and academic aspirations.
Leeds Beckett University, stood out among a sea of choices for several key reasons that I believed would change the trajectory and shape of my future.
I'm Iryn and today I'm going to talk about why Leeds Beckett continues to be the right choice.
First, Leeds Beckett University is renowned for its industry-focused approach to academics spheres.
As a student coming from Africa, to be specific Kenya, I am keenly aware of the growing need for graduates who not only possess theoretical knowledge in their respective fields of specializations, but also the pragmatic aspects required to excel in today’s ever-changing global job market.
The courses offered by Leeds Beckett University, are designed in consultation with industry professionals, with surety that, the education provided is both relevant and up-to-date with market standards.
This hands-on learning approach is a stark contrast to some traditional African institutions where the focus remains heavily on theory.
For my case, I wanted to seek a deeper understanding on Public Relations strategies, and Communications and I was spoilt for choice in Leeds Beckett where I had the option to pursue Masters in International Communications, Global Communications or Public Relations and Strategic Communications , which I went for the latter.
Secondly, the university’s global outlook was a major attraction to me.
Leeds Beckett University, boasts of a diverse student population from over 100 countries, creating a rich multicultural environment.
Coming from Kenya, a country with a vibrant but varied cultural tapestry, I was keen on studying in a setting that embraces diversity and global perspectives.
This experience was to not only broaden my worldview but also enhance my intercultural communication skills; an asset thriving in today’s interconnected global village.
Another consideration, was the strong support international students get from this great institution.
Leeds Beckett provides comprehensive services to ensure that international students feel welcomed and supported throughout their academic journey.
From visa assistance to language support programs, Leeds Beckett University stands out compared to other universities, I checked out in the UK, some of which had limited resources for international students.
Leeds Beckett’s vibrant campus life, located in the heart of Leeds, offers the perfect blend of academic rigor and social engagement.
The city of Leeds itself is a bustling hub of innovation and culture, offers numerous opportunities for internships, networking, and career growth, making it the ideal location for a student like me who is looking to make the most out of my university experience here in the UK.
As a Christian believer, I also checked the Christian Union body offered within the universities, and for Leeds Beckett University, it had an impressive Christian community that attracted me.
Leeds Beckett University is located within the city centre of Leeds, where there are numerous denominational churches across the city and so this meant that I would grow spiritually in faith.
Lastly, of great attraction, was the university’s commitment to sports and wellbeing.
Leeds Beckett’s has a wide array of sports offerings that caters for diverse categories, including those physically challenged persons.
These include; football, rugby, and basketball, athletics, swimming, and martial arts.
The university also has state-of-the-art facilities, such as its renowned modern gymnasiums, playing fields, and specialized training centres.
This sold out on my end, for I knew, I will be physically fit and also get to train and perfect my skills in the course of my academic year.
I also knew I’d get a chance to engage with other students in the physical activities as I create new friendships.
Without leaving out the Leeds Kirkgate market and other African and intercontinental markets around Leeds Beckett University that provide the best cuisines, was another element.
In all aspects, Leeds Beckett University presented itself as the perfect ideal and my go-to-institution that would wholesomely prepare me for a successful and impactful future both at individual and global level.
Hello, I am Iryn, an international student from Kenya.
Currently, pursuing master's degree in Public Relations and Strategic Communications at LBU.

Hi, I’m Erik, an undergraduate L aw student and in this blog, I would like to tell you about the teaching methods and support given at Leeds Beckett University.
One of the standout features of Leeds Beckett is its commitment to modern and effective teaching techniques.
Unlike traditional lecture-heavy approaches, our lecturers employ a mix of interactive lectures, seminars, group work, and workshops.
I find this variety not only keeps the content fresh but also caters to different learning styles.
In my Criminal Law class, our teacher uses case studies, active interactive discussions, and role-playing exercises to illustrate legal principles.
I remember one session where we delved into a famous case study, and I was assigned the role of the def ence attorney.
Arguing my case in front of the class made the material come alive and deepened my understanding of the legal system.
Another memorable seminar involved our professor asking us directly, "Have you ever committed a crime?" t he intensity of these questions and the ensuing debates made the legal concepts much more tangible and personal.
Being questioned about my own hypothetical criminal liability added a real-world dimension to our studies, making each lesson both challenging and incredibly engaging.
At Leeds Beckett, the coursework is designed to be both challenging and stimulating.
Each assignment is a chance to dive deeper into the subject and apply our knowledge in practical ways.
The projects often encourage working together, which helps build a sense of community and teamwork among you and your classmates .
One of my favourite parts about the teaching here is that we're encouraged to discuss and come up with our own answers to the legal cases we cover.
For instance, in my contract Law lectures, it's pretty common for over a hundred of us to argue and debate over a real-life case.
I remember one lively debate where we split into groups, each representing different sides, and the room was full of energy as we presented our perspectives and challenged each other’s viewpoints.
It made learning so much more dynamic and fun .
The university understands the importance of employability and provides so much support to ensure we are ready to enter the professional world with confidence.
One of the standout features for me is the help with developing a strong CV and interview skills.

By the end of the session, I had a much clearer idea of how to write compelling narratives about my achievements and skills.

My first mock interview was a bit nerve-wracking, but it gave me a chance to practice my responses and receive constructive feedback.
It was reassuring to know what to expect and how to handle tricky questions.

Hi, I’m Kate, a Sport and Exercise Science student at Leeds Beckett university.
I am currently in my second year and as much as I would love to stay at Leeds Beckett forever, I have recently had to start thinking more seriously about what I’m going to do after I graduate and what career path I would like to go down.
So, in this blog, I will be sharing my experiences with the Leeds Beckett Career Support Services they have to offer.
First things first, I want to talk about the brilliant Beckett Careers Team.
They are there to help you with any worries or queries that are careers related - whether you are unsure about which career path to take, need help with your CV or any general advice on getting a job, they are there to support you.
When I visited them, their team of dedicated advisors provided personalised guidance, completely tailored to my individual aspirations and goals.
When I visited them r ecently, the Careers Team provided me with personalised guidance, completely tailored to my individual aspirations and goals.
I wanted to explore potential career options and discuss my considerations of pursuing a master's degree after completing my Undergraduate studies.
The careers advisor looked through the Physiotherapy master’s degrees at Leeds Beckett and other institutions.
We looked through the entry requirements and spoke about what I can be doing in the meantime to prepare and help me get there.
Additionally, she encouraged me to attend Postgraduate Open Days to aid in my decision-making process.
Their expertise and support have really boosted my confidence, making me feel ready to take on whatever the job market throws my way.
This appointment was a game-changer for me.
After our chat, I did some further digging into Physiotherapy Postgraduate degrees and realised it is something I'm genuinely interested in pursuing to further my education and future career.
I learned from my career meetings that they're not just about job hunting.
They're a safe space to chat about anything on your mind about life after university.
When I mentioned I wanted a break before starting my master's, the advisor was super supportive about it.
They reassured me saying lots of students take time off, and encouraged me to go for it.
They even pointed out how traveling could be an awesome opportunity to learn new things and gain some life experience.
It's got me really excited about the idea of exploring different countries and figuring out what I want to do next.
The careers advisor I met with shared an incredible resource that I've found incredibly valuable: the Career Planner .
This tool is basically a short quiz that dives into your interests and preferred work environments.
It's been eye-opening for me – I've discovered careers I didn't even know existed!
For example, I've found myself wanting to explore opportunities in Cardiac Rehabilitation, which I hadn't previously considered.
As a result, I'm now contemplating making the cardiovascular system the focal point of my final year project.
Reflecting on my experience, I definitely recommend this resource to anyone who may be feeling uncertain or undecided about their career path.
The insights gained from exploring various career possibilities are so valuable in shaping your future aspirations.
What I find particularly helpful is the guidance on making a CV.
MyHub doesn't just give me a generic template and wish me luck – it goes above and beyond.
It offers a user-friendly CV template for those who might be unsure of where to start, and for those who already have a CV put together it even provides a tool to upload and receive suggestions for improvements on those existing CVs.
Recently, when I was applying for a part-time waitressing job in Leeds, MyHub gave me amazing advice.
It pointed out that I needed to emphasise skills like 'great customer service' and 'communication' – it made me think about how I've gained these skills over the years.
It made me realise that I can tailor my CV to fit any job I apply for, opening up a world of possibilities for my future.
Leeds Beckett is truly amazing in providing career support to students seeking guidance or a nudge in the right direction.
It’s important to remember that you don't always have to have your entire life mapped out.
Personally, I've come to realise that I've placed a lot of pressure on myself to have everything figured out – from my career path to my identity.
However, I've also come to accept that uncertainty is a part of the journey.
With the reassurance and guidance of the careers team, I've learned that it's okay not to have all the answers right away.
Instead, I'm focusing on pursuing what I enjoy and trusting that everything else will fall into place in due time.

I study BA Journalism with Public Relations and having now returned to my final year of studies at Leeds Beckett University, I want to share my thoughts on the importance of a placement year; the ways it has benefitted not only my CV but also how I have grown as a person.
Back in July 2023, I completed my 12 month internship at The Walt Disney Company HQ in Hammersmith, London, working as the PR intern for Disney Destinations International.
Amidst a whirlwind of magical memories with crazy cast members, campaign collaborations, LinkedIn connections and a bank of shameless Instagram posts that I gained over the year, the experiences I had will stick with me forever and I made friends for life.
I feel so grateful for the remarkable opportunities I was trusted with, which enabled me to cross paths with inspiring individuals from various areas of the business, including external agencies.
As a PR intern, the development of my communication skills and the relationships I have shaped allowed me to confidently represent not only the brand I worked for, but the brand I now carry within myself - both professionally and personally.
While on placement I handled the sales, marketing, promotion and publicity of the Disney Parks, Resorts and Disney Cruise Line to UK & Ireland.
As part of the PR team, we worked across integrated communication campaigns and strategies for Disney Parks & Resorts, geared towards our UK & Ireland guests – shining the spotlight on beloved destinations like Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, Disneyland Paris and Disney Cruise Line in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).
Having spent two years studying at Leeds Beckett University, I had built valuable preparation for my industrial placement year.
I was able to apply skills learnt from relevant modules surrounding Public Relations to my internship work, my communication skills and confidence had also improved so I was able to network my way around the office.
Moving out of my hometown and settling into Leeds in 2020, gave me the courage and independence to navigate moving to London and meeting new people for my placement year.
Being offered the placement position at Disney was really a full circle moment for me.
Back in 2019 when I was deciding on which university to attend, I initially wanted to study Journalism as a standalone course, until I visited an open day at Leeds Beckett University and learnt about the combination of studying Journalism with Public Relations.
Senior lecturer, Shirley Beresford, hosted the open day and presented work by a previous placement student, Emma Wooley, who had undertaken a placement year internship at The Walt Disney Company.
Showcasing the benefits of studying Public Relations and undertaking an industrial placement year immediately inspired me to explore the combined course.
Upon reflection, I can definitely recognise the advantages of studying PR while maintaining the required Journalism transferable skills and work experience.
Reflecting on my placement year’s impact on my final year studies, I’ve found that adopting a 9-5 routine has brought much-needed structure to my university life.
I manage to juggle my lectures and seminars with independent study time, a part-time job as a freelance writer, dedication to my university cheerleading team all while keeping up a crazy, fun personal life as a 21-year-old student living in Leeds – phew.
In addition to my placement duties, I tackled university assignments like the Initial Placement Report, a virtual Academic Visit, and a Reflective Report.
These tasks compelled me to document my entire placement journey, ensuring I recorded weekly activities and held myself accountable with the guidance of my line managers.
These reports proved invaluable in recalling crucial work experiences.
Furthermore, the Work Placement module allowed me to drop a module in my final semester, freeing up time to focus on essential projects and my dissertation.
My internship not only hooked me up with a respectable list of media contacts through meetings and events but also equipped me with the tools to develop and nurture these connections throughout my career.
Maintaining ties with industry professionals has become an invaluable resource for my PR dissertation research.
If you’re thinking about undertaking a placement year, I definitely recommend aiming high when applying and making use of the university’s careers team ( Beckett Careers ) for help tailoring your CV, Cover Letter, mastering interview skills, assessment centres and much more.
Before I began applying for placements, I signed up to multiple workshops to help improve my CV and interview skills.
I also set up a call with a member of the Beckett Careers team to discuss any queries I had about my placement year.
MyHub offers advice and support, a skills hub and a careers section to help you search for experience outside of academia.
I found lots of internship vacancies to apply for on the jobs section.
Not to be dramatic but undertaking a placement year was the best decision of my life thus far.
Moving to London, living with new people I had never met and working in an office for the first time ever taught me so many invaluable life lessons.
Leeds Beckett University encouraged me to use my passion for creativity in my studies as well as helping me in my search for a suitable placement experience and it sure paid off.
So, dream big and aim high because you will not regret it!

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2024/03/how-my-course-is-preparing-me-as-a-future-marketer:
Hi, Quinn here!
I’m an MSc Management and Marketing student at Leeds Beckett.
As a marketer with three years of experience prior to studying in the UK, some may wonder why I continue with a Master's course, as marketing seems to be a practical field.
Let me tell you the secrets of why this course has been the most helpful sidekick for my future career.
It is nearly impossible for undergraduates to make the right career choice.
I think this mindset is very common for many students, as we don’t know which job is suitable right off the bat.
My course covers both business perspectives and specialized marketing skills, which are an excellent support for my future work.
Thanks to the subjects, I gain a clearer vision of how to develop sustainably in a competitive marketing job.
I have the chance to meet amazing people through my course!
As a marketer, connecting with people is one of the most fundamental skills to thrive in the industry.
The Business School is full of international students coming from every part of the world.
This dynamic and diverse environment not only motivates me to grow but also helps us support each other in exploring our abilities.
Although I have worked in the industry for three years, I was not a marketing student at the beginning.
So, it is crucial for me to learn about the foundation of marketing through the course, which offers a wide range of helpful modules.
For instance, from my previous jobs, I know the pain of calculating budgets for future projects: There are just too many estimates and predictions!
Nevertheless, the Managing Financial Resources module helps me understand how to do the process effectively.
However, it doesn’t stop at only practical knowledge.
My soft skills have improved tremendously since I’ve been to the UK.
The subjects allow us to refine various essential aspects, such as presenting, critical thinking, and teamwork.
These skills will be my most potent weapon to prepare for my future “working battles.”
I believe experience is what sets people apart, as you grow differently based on what happens around you.
Studying abroad has given me the gift of experiencing a new environment.
It surprises me every day to see the difference in how marketing campaigns work in the UK compared to Vietnam: Even for the same international brands that have branches in both countries, how they promote their images is unique.
This is an invaluable lesson for me to broaden my view as a marketer.
Continuing my education in the UK is one of the best choices I’ve ever made.
My course allows me to understand more about my career path and grow to be a better person.
So, if you want to explore your potential, don’t hesitate to take new steps in studying!
Hi, I’m Quinn, nice to meet you all!
I’m a MSc Management and Marketing student at the Business School.
I love traveling, so my goal is to go to as many places as possible to embrace the beauty of cultural diversity.
As a marketer back in Vietnam, I also love to write and explore various creative and artistic activities.

Hello, my name is Kabindra and I'm going to share how I found a part time job and how I balance that whilst keeping up with my studies.
From the moment you descend to the glistening skyline of London to becoming a student at Leeds Beckett University, and then living the student life and juggling part-time jobs, and your studies, the journey as an international student in a new country is full of excitement and hard work.
The art of balancing your student life with work-life balance is a topic often overlooked.
Join me, as I unravel the tips and secrets to time management and having a great work-life balance.
As stressful as job hunting may sound, in my experience, job hunting was very straight forward.
I started looking for part-time jobs before I came to the UK; ‘Global Student Ambassador’ being one of them.
To become one of the ambassadors, join as many events organised by Global Village or Student’s Union; That way, you will get to know the openings for such jobs.
There are various jobs other than Global Student Ambassador, you just need to take time and look for it.
Once settled, I immediately started applying through various popular job sites, whether it be a server job in a restaurant, or a sales assistant in retail, I was diligently searching for a part time job that would fit my schedule and legality (fitting the criteria of my visa).
So, how do you get a reference?
I discovered the power of volunteering.
I volunteered at FoodCycle to gain a few references and also gain some UK based experience which held more weight than having no experience at all.
For volunteering, you can search the student union volunteering list to help find volunteering jobs.
I acquired my first job from Indeed, I applied to a myriad of various companies and jobs.
It was around 1 and a half months with no luck until one random dusk I got a call from one of the jobs enquiring whether I could come in for an interview at 2pm; of course I immediately said yes like any other job interview I was invited to.
Later that same day I got a call from the supervisor from the interview saying that they were very impressed by the interview and they were delighted to give me the position saying that I was the ‘perfect fit’ for the job; it was a euphoric feeling like I was on cloud 9.
If you ask me for the best intake for international students to come to the UK, and have a higher chance of securing a job, I would have to go with September intake.
Considering the fact that Halloween and Christmas will be around the corner, businesses will be hiring more employees.
Even if you get a job as a Christmas Temp, most often, it could potentially lead to you having a permanent position.
On the flip side, if you are coming in on January intake, you will still have a chance to get a job of course.
As a student, you are met with many obstacles which include various deadlines, lectures to attend, along with the hopes of earning extra pocket money.
As daunting as it may sound, it is an experience that will set you for life, and will teach you important life skills.
One of the skills you need to learn is time management.
Firstly, sort out your priorities and then allocate how many hours you can commit to working.
Try not to put in too many hours because it will hamper your studies and your mental health.
Look out for when you have your lectures, and then give yourself some resting time, and then you can put the rest of the hours on working a job.
Don’t forget to make deadlines and your lectures a priority.
As much as money and job sounds great, if you veer off from what you came here to do, you will always struggle to keep on top of everything.
One of the apps I would suggest to help yourself stay organised is Google Calendar.
It has been my best friend for a long time and has helped me stay on track with all my deadlines and work.
Don’t forget to allocate free time whenever you can for you to be able to enjoy student life slowly.
You don’t want to get burnt out amongst all the tasks that you are doing.
Take a stroll around the park or visit places near where you live.
My primary recommendation for students at Leeds Beckett is to visit York and Lake District.
Luckily, Global Village organises various such events and trips for you to never get bored, and explore the UK, whilst making unforgettable memories.
Before you start looking for a job outside the university, why not try looking for job opportunities that the university provides.
There are various other on-campus jobs that you can apply for, which you can search for over at the Student Union's website or the Leeds Beckett website.
For Leeds Beckett, it is called ‘MyHub’ , all you need to do is login using your student credentials and start the job search.
You also have the option to seek advice from the career advice team, or use websites like Indeed and LinkedIn.
Then there is always an option for job fairs.
Attend the events, try to find jobs that align with your interest, you will get to know the businesses that are hiring and can use the strategy of physically handing out your CV.
Now, let's shift gears to a role close to my heart: that of a global student ambassador.
As a global student ambassador, I've had the privilege of representing my university to prospective students from around the globe and representing myself and my country at the same time.
From hosting campus tours to participating in virtual information sessions, this role has allowed me to share my experiences and insights, helping prospective students navigate the exciting journey of higher education.
Moreover, the flexibility of this role has helped me get that work-life balance, and focus on my studies.
As promised before, coming to the process of recruiting a student ambassador, it was pretty simple.
Once there is an opening for the job, simply email the Global Village , and they will send you the form to fill up and an essay sharing your experience as a student here in Leeds Beckett.
Once you get past that, you will be called for a group interview, and if you pass it, your training begins and you will become a global student ambassador.
Being part of the university's blog squad and writing blogs is an experience in itself.
I get to help students all around the world know about my experience, and things they can learn from it.
I try my best to help the prospective students to learn from my experience so it’ll be easier for them and won’t have to struggle much balancing their life and their work.
It’s about creating a sense of feeling via my writing skills to not make people feel like they are on their own, but rather to give them the comfort of letting them know that there are many students who go through similar issues like they do and it’s totally fine.
So, writing for the blog squad has been the best part of me sharing my experience.
In conclusion, navigating the intricacies of part-time work while pursuing a university education is no small feat.
It requires dedication, resilience, and a healthy dose of time management .
But with careful planning, strategic prioritisation, and a sprinkle of passion, students can strike the perfect balance and thrive in both realms.
Until next time, I will be signing off.

Which is why I think it's important to research a course in depth, by looking at the modules you will study, the placement opportunities that may be available, and what type of facilities you will be able to use.
I really wanted to study on a course that offered a mixture of teaching and placements, so I could get hands on work experience.
At Leeds Beckett, their Speech and Language Therapy course not only has a mixed placement model, but they also arrange for us to a ttend guest lectures from specialist clinicians and medics.
Like me you might also be interested in a course which offers placement opportunities, or perhaps you'd like to study a year abroad, or even study a course which provides a year working in an industry.
When searching for courses make sure you look at what is included in the course content and consider if this matches the type of study you like and the type of experiences you would like to have.
For me, a key part of researching where I wanted to study included attending Open Days.
An Open Day is a great way to get first-hand information about the subject you’re interested in studying and get a feel for both the university and the surrounding city.
At a Leeds Beckett Open Day , you can attend informative subject talks, view course facilities, and chat with academic staff throughout the day at the various subject stands.
Both City and Headingley Campuses will also be bustling with helpful Student Ambassadors who will be available to answer any questions and tell you what it’s like studying at Leeds Beckett.
When I visited on an Open Day, I found it so helpful being able to chat with people studying on the course.
Having the opportunity to ask them lots of questions allowed me to find out more about the subject I was interested in applying for and really understand why so many people love studying at LBU.
I also got to explore the Speech and Language Therapy facilities and see places like the library, and the SU.
Overall, attending an Open Day really helped to shape my decision to apply to study here.
Even though my online research had helped me narrow down the universities I was interested in, attending in person allowed me to get a taste of what it would actually be like to study here.
While a large part of deciding which university I wanted to go to involved me considering the course I wanted to study, the study facilities, and academic support available, I was also actively considering the social life that I would have.
Whether you’re going to be living in your uni city or commuting to campus, you’ll be spending a lot of time in this place.
Which is why I think it’s important to make sure the university you apply to has events and activities that match the kind of social life and interests you enjoy.
When I was researching Leeds Beckett, I looked at the different societies that are available for me to join and could see there was a wide range, including a society for my course.
In addition, I could see how many exciting events the Students’ Union organise throughout the year, including vintage clothing fairs and live music events.
What stood out to me most was that Leeds Beckett is a lively, vibrant university, with so much going on at both its campuses.
My course is based at City Campus which is located about five minutes away from the city centre.
One thing I love is that I can quickly walk into the city and go to one of the many restaurants or bars with my friends at the end of the day, when we’ve finished all our lectures.
Being in a central location was at the top of my list when I was looking at universities to apply for and I’m so glad I chose to study here at LBU.
Overall, I can safely say that choosing to study here at LBU was the right choice.
I really enjoy and appreciate the placements opportunities offered through my course, the supportive staff, and the atmosphere on campus.
One last piece of advice I’d like to share is that it takes time to think everything over, so if you haven’t made your mind up yet, don’t worry.
I hope reading this blog was useful and that it will help you navigate the process of choosing the university that’s right for you.
We've put together a handy hub of information.
You can find out everything you need to know, including tips on writing your personal statement,  the UCAS application process, and more.

Leeds Beckett’s attitude to employability was one of the main reasons why I wanted to study at this university.
Within the course modules they cover a lot of content that links to employment in the media and film industry.
This is great when you're not exactly sure what you want to do yet as a career, as you are given the time to learn about each aspect of the industry and a range of career paths, which gives you a broader view and more knowledge to help make those important career decisions in the future.
I also knew that I would have the option to specialise in certain topics so if there is an area I really like, I can find out more about this too.
The Filmmaking course is constantly working on helping us increase our employability skills and this has been the case from the moment I joined.
Right from the beginning in the first semester we learnt about each aspect of the job as a filmmaker.
First, we started off by learning about all of the main roles that are in filmmaking, from directing and producing, to editing.
Learning about specific jobs, the different options available and how the course content helps to get you there is really useful.
This then also helps you make decisions for your future as I’ve found it’s made me become more confident with my choices, due to the fact that you get taught specific things about each specialism.
The amount of additional help tutors provide when it comes to employability is a lot!
The tutors base what they are teaching us off their own experiences as an industry expert and many of them still work or are connected to in the industry, meaning that we are getting current knowledge of the sector.
From their experience they teach you life lessons and tips and tricks to make you more employable and appealing to companies.
They also help with interview techniques such as getting better at pitching ideas to people and showing off your creative thoughts to others to get their attention so that they may think of hiring you or giving you an offer.
Leeds Beckett doesn’t just help with future employment, it also helps with student employability too, offering jobs for students as well as suggesting jobs that are available in the area that would be suitable students and graduates.
This was one reason I chose LBU, as the number of jobs in the city of Leeds is massive and means that the opportunities to add experience to my CV is great.
The range of roles in the city range too, from part time work to full time employment.
There's a range of jobs too from hospitality to retail, business to sport and each one gives valuable experiences to us as students.
LBU is incredibly good when it comes to employability, as it helps students prepare for the future and the job options they'll have after leaving their course.
They also help students who are currently studying to find jobs to help them get through university and enhance their cv which will help them find more jobs in the future and make sure they have a better chance in life.
I believe that this is because they care about their students while they’re studying and their futures.
Hi, I'm Jude a first-year student studying filmmaking at Leeds Beckett University.
In my spare time I play games and like to edit short films and videos for my Scouts.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2021/09/why-i-wanted-to-apply-to-university:
Everyone’s reasons for applying to university are different.
Some people have always known that they wanted to go and what they want to study whereas for others it’s a last-minute decision.
The decision to go to university can be a big one, which is why I think it has to come from you.
Choosing to apply to Leeds Beckett was the best decision I made, not only academically but also for myself.
One of the biggest motivations I had for applying to university was my future career as university is great experience that allows you to open up doors to multiple career paths.
Like most people at the age of 18 I didn’t have a clue what career I wanted to do, so by applying to university I knew I could expand my knowledge on my chosen subject area as well as develop skills that are crucial within any workplace.
I found it really appealing that you get to pick a course specific to what you enjoy, compared to school where you have to study what your told, which gives university a more positive outlook on learning.
I’ve found through choosing a course I know I’m interested in, I’m excited to learn and find the classes really engaging.
I’ve learnt a lot about myself during my time at university, I enjoy helping others and teaching people about my course.
Now that I’m going into my third year I’ve decided that I want to go into teaching and I’ll be staying at Leeds Beckett for another year to attain my PGCE so I can continue learning and teaching a subject I love.
Another reason I wanted to apply for university was to develop my independence and learn valuable life skills.
As much as I loved living at home with my family, I was ready to start looking after myself and feeling more like an adult.
University gives you the opportunity to be independent and have more freedom whilst also having a guide and easy access to help and support, taking the pressure off you while you’re learning how to live on your own.
One of the best life skills I’ve learnt whilst at university is meal prepping.
I have now learnt to make lists before I go to the shop to prevent myself from buying unnecessary items and it helps me to manage my finances, because trust me when I say those extra snacks and random bits of room decor you picked up from the middle aisle in Aldi soon starts to add up.
Going to university is more than just about learning academically and preparing for your future career, it's also about meeting new people and trying new things.
I was really excited about university social life and as scary as it seemed I really wanted to try new sports and join new clubs; Leeds Beckett offers a range of both from Jiu Jitsu to photography.
I ended up joining the women’s lacrosse team, a sport I'd never played before, and I made lots of new friends and get to compete at different universities every week.
We also have lots of team socials where we all go out together and do different activities such as going out for drinks and team meals.
The social aspect has been one of the highlights of my university experience and was definitely one of my top reasons for applying.
Another impacting factor on why I applied for university was for my own personal development, I felt I had become stuck within my comfort zone, and I needed a change.
As someone who had only ever lived in a small town, moving to a big city like Leeds was a big step for me both physically and mentally.
I was always someone who liked to talk about trying new things and joining new clubs but due to my own fears and anxiety, I often found myself backing out at the last minute or pushing things back telling myself “maybe next time”.
This often left me feeling like I was missing out, always sat on the side-line and I knew the only way to fix this was to push myself out of my comfort zone.
The big step of going to university as exactly what I needed to show myself that I could do it and that I didn't need to be afraid.
It gave me the opportunity to experience new places and activities in a safe and welcoming environment and my confidence grew every week.
I’m not saying that going to university solved all my problems and everything was easy, I was still nervous and sometimes a little scared and yes sometimes I had to check my timetable six times in case I read the wrong room number the first five times, but that one step gave me the confidence to at least try new things and no longer be stuck on the side-line.
Applying to university was definitely the right choice for me, without it I wouldn’t be the person I am today.
Hi, I'm Laura and I'm studying Sport and Exercise Science here at Leeds Beckett University.
In my free time I love to play sport, write and sing.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/10/top-tips-for-writing-your-personal-statement:
Hi, I’m Hollie, a Sports and Exercise Therapy student at Leeds Beckett.
In this blog I’m going to provide you with some useful tips for writing your personal statement.
The personal statement section of the UCAS application is an important part of the process.
This is an opportunity for you to tell the universities all about yourself.
Some of you may be sat staring at the screen thinking ‘How on earth do I write about myself?’ Don’t worry, I’ve been there.
Highlighting all of your best points, skills and aspirations can be a tricky thing to do, but it’s not impossible and I am here to help you.
Before you start tapping away at your computer or staring at a blank screen, here are a few things which could help you prepare and get you started:
You want your personal statement to stand out from the crowd.
In my opinion, the introduction should start with something that will show them you are a little bit different and that will also show them your personality.
The purpose of the introduction is to let the university know why you are excited about the course and to make them want to read more about you.
In this section, it’s your opportunity to tell the university why you are applying for the course.
When writing my application, I asked myself ‘What has made you want to apply for the course?’ I found that going straight in the with the ‘why’ at the beginning of the paragraph instantly made it clear to the university exactly what it was I wanted out of the course and my motivations for applying.
Keeping your points concise and using simple short sentences throughout your personal statement is a good way to keep the reader engaged and ensure that your point doesn’t get lost.
Within this section I recommend explaining how the course fits in with your future aspirations and how the degree will allow you to pursue these dreams.
I used the research I gathered about the course and modules to help explain why I was looking forward to certain aspects.
This showed the university that I was already proactive, organised and passionate about the subject, which is a key part of being at university.
Next, it’s time to dive into your past education and work experience.
This section is all about showcasing how they relate to the course and have inspired you to pursue your specific career path.
This is a great way to show off what you have already done and skills you have already gained.
Add in any past courses you have done, A levels or BTECS that may be related to the course, or extra courses you have completed outside of college.
In my application I made reference to my BTEC and talked about what I had learnt and how this knowledge will be beneficial to certain modules on the course.
I was also able to talk about why I enjoyed specific elements of my BTEC and how I was looking forward to learning more about the subject at university level.
After your education I recommend talking about any jobs or work experience you have already had.
Now is a really good time to pick up on your skills and show them off.
Think about things you may have worked on improving or new skills you have learnt?
For example, has your time management improved?
Do you have brilliant customer service?
Are you good at working in a team?
Are you easily able to adapt in situations and think fast?
You could also talk about how these fit into the skills needed for the course you are applying for and how you feel they will help you succeed.
It’s also a great idea to talk a bit about the things you enjoy and take interest in, outside of studying.
This is where your personality really gets to shine.
Do you play a sport?
Do you like to write blog posts?
Do you play a musical instrument?
The list could go on and there are so many interesting things you can mention in this point.
As well as showing the university what I’m about, I also used this section to show how my hobbies related to the course.
I did this by talking about how I had written and worked with many health and fitness brands and so had experience in the industry.
It’s important to show how proud you are of your own achievements.
I used the conclusion to show the university what I wanted to gain from the course.
I asked myself, ‘Why is it worth your time?’ ‘What would you hopefully like to do after the course?’ By talking about the future, it shows that you’re already thinking ahead and know why it is you want to complete the degree.
When you have finished writing it’s a good idea to ask a friend or family member to read through it for you.
I found that a fresh pair of eyes can do wonders when you are sat there wondering if you have done enough or wondering what needs to be changed.
Don’t be afraid to ask friends and family members to read it, read it and read it again until you are happy with the result.
A second opinion and a few re writes can honestly help more than you realise!
Hi I’m Hollie, a fitness instructor, blogger and Sport Therapy student.
I have a passion for all things fitness, wellbeing and mental health.
I am a massive advocate of self love and spreading kindness in everything you do!
I believe together we can make ourselves and the world a better place.

I felt unsure about exactly what I wanted to study and so for this reason, I decided to try something different and go straight into the workplace.
After applying to many apprenticeships, I was fortunate to have gotten an interview within the NHS.
And after that, I was offered the role of an apprentice healthcare assistant within a palliative care centre.
I worked in a hospice supporting individuals who had life-limiting illnesses and were towards the end of their lives.
It was definitely sometimes emotionally challenging but knowing that I was a part of a close-knit team of nurses and practitioners helping to provide the best care and quality of life for patients was fulfilling.
I am extremely grateful for my experience at the hospice, being a part of creating a warm and uplifting environment for wonderful people.
I was very happy in my previous role, but it was it was during my apprenticeship that I started to think about where I wanted to be and where I could see myself in the future.
It was at this point that I started to seriously think about my options, what I wanted for myself and my career.
I started to think about university again but in a different light this time.
The idea appealed to me but I wanted to make sure that I chose something that I would genuinely enjoy.
Because I still didn’t have my mind set on a specific job or career, I wanted to study something quite broad.
Something that would reflect my values - I wanted to help people while also exploring the behind the scenes of healthcare rather than just the frontline.

The personal statement is probably one of the lengthiest parts of the application form.
When it came to writing my personal statement, I didn’t really have any support from a school or college environment as I had just left my apprenticeship and it had been a few years since I’d been in contact with my tutors.
So, I crafted it myself.
I did my own research on how to structure and write a personal statement.
To be quite honest, researching on my own was a challenge as it was a time consuming thing to do, but well worth it!
The UCAS website had some helpful tips and information on writing this section of the application which really helped me.
After some thorough research, the structuring and writing of my personal statement took me around a month.
Crafting my personal statement was quite fun for me because I genuinely enjoy writing, especially when it is about my passions and the ability to be expressive in my writing.
When thinking about what to include in my personal statement, I made sure to research the course and write about things relevant to Public Health.
I aimed to make my knowledge on the degree visible to show that I understood the discipline I was choosing to study.
If you have previous work experience before university, use it to your advantage.
My apprenticeship was a key factor in demonstrating that my work and life experience was integral in my development of person-centred skills, highlighting my empathetic nature and a boost in my confidence overall.

Overall, my personal statement focused on the transferrable skills that I am extremely fortunate to have developed in an NHS care setting, applying them to my aspirations and highlighting that I am keen and willing to learn more.
I was always aware that I wouldn’t be an 18 year old student who had just completed their A-levels or college course.

I was worried that I wouldn’t fit in with the younger students, and that I would find it to be quite overwhelming or difficult to make friends.

I understand that it can be daunting and quite intimidating being the first in the family to think about and apply to university.
You may feel unsure of what course you want to do and where to look for useful information throughout the application process.
I've been in that position and so in this blog I will be shedding a little light on those worries and concerns you may have, to try and help you.
I first found out about university through my sixth form.
They mentioned that those who wanted to attend further study needed to start writing up their personal statements and thinking about the application process.
This was all new to me, I had no idea where to start and figured I should browse the UCAS website for courses that stood out to me and take it from there.
After finding my desired course, I used online resources along with support from my tutor to guide me through drafting my personal statement, linking it to my desired course as much as possible.
During this time, my sixth form tutors and school careers team were my main form of guidance, whereas a lot of my peers were familiar with the application process from their family members who attended university.
Being the first in the family to access higher education may come with outside pressures.
You may have family telling you to pick more traditionally academic courses and to avoid the more creative, practical ones.
You may also feel scared to enter the course you want because your friends are going elsewhere.
I found that it's important not to let these outside pressures influence your course choice.
Pick something you want to do, something you will enjoy.
I remember when applying to university my family were set on me entering the medical field, but after picking Biology for A-levels, I knew that the medical field was not for me.
I wanted to study Primary Education, a course I was passionate about and so that's what I did.
Passion and drive are what will push you to do your best and thrive on your course.
Choose a course that you want to do, not one that others have chosen for you.
Some courses also have interviews and navigating through all that can be difficult (especially if you are the first in your family to attend higher education).
For my interview, I got an email highlighting what I needed to bring with me, this was really helpful.
It explained exactly what we were going to be doing at the interview, so that I could prepare.
The interview consisted of two parts, first we had a group discussion and then we were interviewed on an individual basis.
I was given a postcard from the interviewer which told me what they liked about me at the interview.
Interviews can be scary but just remember that they are all part of the process of moving into higher education and the world of work.
Remember that the university teams are always there to help guide you through this stage.
When applying to university it’s important to know that you need to check your emails daily.
It is the main way that the university will contact you with info on application related matters, induction info, and it’s also where student finance will contact you with information on funding your studies.
Reach out to people you meet in online group chats for university or people you meet at Open Days and interviews.
You are not alone, and your peers can be a great form of guidance and support along the way.
Remember that accessing higher education is a big step, especially if you have broken out a family or community education cycle to get to this stage.
Be proud of yourself and continue to work hard to succeed in education.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/10/how-to-make-the-ucas-application-process-stress-free:
Hi, I’m Izzy and in this blog I’m going to share with you some of my tips for how you can make your UCAS application process as stress free as possible.
The first thing to do when starting your application is to decide when you’re going to work on it, for how long and which part of the application you’ll be working on.
It’s a good idea to keep the UCAS deadline in mind so that you know how long you have for each section and can allow enough time so that you don’t feel rushed.
For example, in my plan I started by dedicating the first day to finding universities which offered courses related to the subject I was interested in.
To begin with, I just made a note of the course titles and universities.
I then assigned myself days within my plan where I would go back and spend more time looking further into a specific course modules and facilities.
Then the next day, I’d look at another course in the same level of detail.
I found that when I structured my time, it meant I was more productive as I had set tasks to accomplish .
Doing a little bit each day and seeing it in a plan made it feel like a smaller task and was more manageable than doing it all in one go.
One thing I would say is to make sure you keep notes as you go along, so that you can remember which ones you liked and reasons for this.
I found these notes really helpful to refer back to in the decision-making process.
When working on the application, don’t forget to schedule in breaks.
I find that just stretching my legs, making a cup of tea and taking regular screen breaks can be huge stress relievers.
They also help you feel more motivated to be productive and continue with the application.
Asking for help can be very useful during this process.
Ask your teachers, friends or parents for help if you ever feel overwhelmed by certain elements of the process.
It’s also important to remember that the universities are always there to provide support and advice, if you need it.
When I was applying, I was unsure whether university was the right path for me, so I rang the lecturers and spoke to them about the course I was interested in.
This really helped to ease my mind and now I study that course at Beckett and love it!
As well as speaking to staff at Leeds Beckett you can speak to students and read all about their experiences in their blogs and vlogs .
If you find a course that you like the sound of but don’t think you’ll have enough UCAS points to get onto it, it’s always worth giving the university a call to talk to admissions.
The university will be able to provide further advice and let you know about the options you have available.
There are many ways that people prefer to work in order to stay calm and stress free.
Personally, I liked to listen to music as I worked on my application and I switched between classical and music from around the world.
Having it on in the background relaxed me, but also kept me focused.
I found that choosing music without lyrics helped me to concentrate on my writing, so this tactic really helped me.
My final piece of advice is don’t work on your application in your bedroom if you can help it.
Your room should be a place where you can relax and so by working in there too, you create an association between stressful work and your personal space which will make it harder for you to relax.
I recommend working in a library or another room in your house so that you still have a separate space to relax, after your work on the application is complete.
Personally, I found working in a coffee shop was beneficial for me as there was enough background noise to calm me without it being overwhelming.
Separating spaces and making sure you have a place to relax is extremely important for your mental health.
Hopefully some of these tips will help you feel more relaxed as you go through the application process.
Now it’s time to get researching, writing and put them to practice.
Hi, I'm Izzy and I'm a first year studying Broadcast Media Technologies.
In my spare time, I'm an avid writer and photographer but I also love just kicking back and watching rubbish films with my mates.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2020/09/things-to-think-about-when-you-apply-to-university:
Hi, I’m Chelsea and in this blog I’m going to share with you a few things that I found useful to think about before I applied for my undergraduate degree at university.
If you are just starting your UCAS applications, you may feel overwhelmed by the process and steps involved.
I’m here to reassure you that if you break it down into manageable sections, and take the time to consider what you want to get out of the next three years, it can be a really productive and rewarding process.
The tips below will give you an idea of what to consider before applying and hopefully they can help you feel more prepared.
Firstly, it’s important to think carefully about the course you want to study.
Is the subject you have selected, the right one for you?
When completing my UCAS application, I decided to apply to study a subject that I enjoyed at A-Level.
Even though I liked this topic, after starting university I soon realised that I didn’t enjoy all aspects of the subject and ended up regretting my decision.
Unhappy with my choice, I decided to take a year out to carefully consider what I was passionate about and research other courses in detail.
I found that Journalism was the degree for me, and the rest is history.
From my experience, I recommend that you make sure you fully understand what the course consists of.
To do this, it’s a good idea to look at the specific modules to make sure that you understand what the subject is about at degree level.
You can find this information on the university websites.
When reading the modules, ask yourself, does this interest me?
Do I want to know more?
You will be spending a considerable amount of time studying these topics so it is vital that they are something you will enjoy and be engaged with.
Your university experience will be a lot more than just lectures and seminars, so it’s worth looking at the facilities and extra-curricular activities the universities provide too.
Leeds Beckett is known for its sporting achievements and high-quality facilities, so if you are part of a team and looking to continue, or wanting to try something new, then Beckett is a great place to do that.
We have a new state-of-the-art sports centre that includes world class indoor and outside athletics facilities, high performance strength and conditioning suites and cool hangout spots to catch up with friends, so there’s plenty for you to enjoy.
The location of the university was also an important factor to me.
I wanted to be somewhere that was similar to my hometown of Newcastle, but far enough away to feel like I was truly independent.
I’d also visited Leeds several times growing up and knew how good the food scene was, so it was a top contender from the get-go.
When researching the university, think about whether it is somewhere you could imagine yourself for the next three years?
Living and studying in a city you feel comfortable in is important.
For example, if you feel better in a quiet, low key setting, you could be better suited to a small city.
If you are someone who enjoys the vibrant city life, then applying to a university like Leeds Beckett with a thriving student scene would suit you.
Beckett has the best of both worlds with the hustle and bustle of the city and the beautiful countryside in the suburb of Headingley just outside the centre.
It is a good idea to make a list of things that are important to you both academically and socially and assess whether the university has what you are looking for.
Getting in touch with universities early on, either through Open Days , Chat to a Student or through simply calling and asking questions, is definitely a wise move to help you make an informed decision.
Although finances of day-to-day living might not be on your mind right now, it is worth checking if you will be able to live comfortably in the university and city you have chosen before applying.
My tip is to work out how much you will end up with per month and then factor in the cost of your rent and utilities.
You need to make sure that you are still left with a decent amount to enjoy your time at university as that’s part of the whole experience.
As a rule of thumb, I’ve found that the further South you go the more expensive everything is, so take that into account when considering where to apply to.
Leeds is a very reasonably priced and affordable city.
I lived in an entire house with my partner for less than £500 a month in my second year, whereas it would be almost impossible to get a single room for the same price in London.
Finally, studying somewhere with good job prospects is also a factor to consider.
If you are thinking of getting a part-time job whilst at university, Leeds has a great selection of bars and restaurants that can easily fit around your studies.
So, there you have it!
I hope the tips above have helped shed some light on things to consider before applying to university.
If you start the process early, ask questions, and do your research; there’s no need to worry, you’ll be fine.
Hello, my name is Chelsea and I’m a PhD student and GTA in Political Communication at the university.
When I’m not stuck in the library I love scoping out new restaurants and exploring the countryside.

Hi, I’m Albina and here are my tips for UCAS Applications.
After applying through UCAS I received three unconditional offers and chose Leeds Beckett.
Researching what you want to do for the next 3 or 4 years of your life is a big deal.
Make sure you look at university websites, Online Open Days and reviews on websites such as Discover Uni and The Student Room.
Do not panic about your personal statement this is an opportunity to show what you’re all about.
Look at some examples online of previous UCAS personal statements and have your CV ready to pull ideas from and use within your personal statement to ‘sell’ yourself.
First, start by writing up your statement in a Word document.
This is because Word has a word count to keep you on track and prevent you from writing too much (that will be cut off on your UCAS application).
UCAS limit is 4,000 characters, approx.
500 words.
Introduction : Catchy opening sentence.
Don’t use quotes or phrases such as “I have dreamed since I was 11 to be”
Main body : A-level subjects/ hobbies/work experience/ skills linked to the course (look at the university’s course website to make specific references).
Conclusion : Future career goals and your suitability for the course.
Do’s of personal statement :
Don’ts of personal statement :
UCAS Firm Choice
This is your first-choice course and university, meaning that if you get the grades you will go straight to your firm choice and your insurance choice will be discarded.
Tips:
UCAS Insurance Choice
This is your second choice or, in other words, your reserve choice if you do not get into your firm choice.

Hi, I’m Abi, a first-year student studying Events Management at Beckett.
I’m here to help those of you who are thinking about joining LBU, or plan to join in the near future.
Exciting times ahead for you all!
The application process was fairly straight forward, but I understand that it is still easy to get overwhelmed by it all, as it is the start of a whole new process.
I’m going to share my application experience with you to hopefully make it less stressful.
One thing that helped me was to try to make this process fun and exciting.
You may be thinking that’s easier said than done, but you have sooo much support around you, so let’s start there.
Firstly, your school or college will be happy to help you with this process.
So definitely take them up on all the help you can get and don’t be afraid to keep pestering them by asking lots of questions, I did just that and it really paid off.
What helped me the most was speaking to students who have already gone through the process, and reading things like the Student Blog Squad , as they have more first-hand experience about it than anyone else.
Reading about students' experiences helped it all become more real and less like an alien thing; I had never even written a cover letter before applying to uni, let alone a personal statement.
So squeeze as much info and help out of online resources , friends, family, students at uni and teachers when you can.
Don’t forget Leeds Beckett and UCAS are also there on the end of the phone too, so don’t be afraid to give them a call.
They probably recognised my number by the time I finished applying…
One of the common words you hear as a student is deadlines.
They are forever in the back of our minds and it is very easy to let them get on top of you.
This being said, they can also be helpful to guide us and you can avoid stress with some simple planning.
With your uni application, give yourself enough time to do everything and most importantly, check the deadline before you start.
Some universities or particular courses have different deadlines to others, so always double and triple check these deadlines against your individual course and uni.
Then, if time allows, try to get your application in a good few days before the deadline in case any issues crop up, like if your personal statement is too long so it won’t upload, or your system crashes or Wi-Fi goes down.
Having the extra time and not having to rush will also help improve the quality of your personal statement.
It gives you time to proofread, and proofread it again, as well as checking all the details you have put in on the UCAS form, which need to be accurate.
I can’t remember how many times I proofread over everything, it was a lot!
Then I also got my sister and friends to read over it too, because often when you’re reading your own work you sometimes miss things, so a fresh pair of eyes looking over it will never harm.
When choosing the top five universities to put in your UCAS application, give yourself time to look at every aspect of what your university experience will look like at each place.
Where might you live, can you see yourself settling there?
What’s the route to campus like?
What’s your new area like?
Pick apart your course, it will be taught slightly differently everywhere, so scrutinise the course modules – you can find them all online – and try to chat to your potential new lecturers.
Remember that you are going to uni to get a degree at the end of it (and of course for the fun and socialising along the way).
So, making sure that the course suits you and what you want to get out of it, is probably the most important element to consider when choosing the university.
It’s very easy to get stuck on a particular uni because of perhaps where it is, or how you’ve always dreamt of going there, but you need to be careful not to get tunnel vision about it if the course isn’t entirely what you want.
The course was probably the biggest deciding factor for me as I was quite particular about which industries I wanted to go into.
I had whittled my choices down to Beckett and one other and I struggled to choose which one I loved more.
The other was closer to home but the course was so much more suited to what I wanted here at LBU, so I was totally torn.
Now that I’ve done the first term, making my decision based on the course quality was the best thing I could have done, and the distance from home doesn’t really bother me, FaceTime works just as well!
One way that can help you decide is to make the most of your Online Open Days and Applicant Days.
During these events you can speak lecturers and talk to other students online, get a feel for the uni all from your own home (saves travel and money; always looking to save money now as a student).
Once you’ve submitted your application, it is a bit of a waiting game but it’s a good opportunity to possibly get to know more about the universities you’ve applied to.
Do some more research and find out why you’ll love it and which you like the most, as you will still need to make the decision about which uni to go to, if you get more than one offer.
I got my first email saying, ‘Log into UCAS Track’ when I was at work and my phone was there burning a hole in my bag for about three hours before I was able to check it.
When I finally got to read the email I was so excited to see I had an offer accepted; I was going to uni!
This was a great feeling and made it all worth it.
It’s such a great, new and exciting chapter to start.
However, don’t let not being accepted by one get you down, just see it as one less to try and pick from; that was the hardest bit, trying to pick which university I wanted to go to.
The main reasons for me choosing Beckett out of my offer options was that the course was exactly what I wanted.
Also, I really liked the general vibe of the uni, when I was there at the Open Day; everything just ran smoothly and there were so many people in purple keen to help.
Applying to uni is exciting, a little bit nerve wracking and the start of a new chapter, but don’t let it overwhelm you.
It is a fairly easy process and very straight forward once you start.
Just be sure to get support where you can and don’t be shy to ask questions; the silliest question is the one you don’t ask.
I think the biggest piece of advice I could give you is give yourself enough time, it is not a process that you want to rush, if you don’t have to.
Enjoy it, look forward to the next chapter of your life, and make it count.
Coming to Beckett was the best decision I’ve ever made.
Hey, I’m Abi and I'm studying Events Management at Leeds Beckett.
I am a sociable person with a passion for the outdoors, keeping busy and doing sports and fitness.

Hi, I’m Ellie, a first year Dietetics student at LBU and here are my top five things to consider before you send your UCAS application off.
First, it’s a good idea to make sure that you have explored all of your aspirations and interests to find the course best suited to you.
I found the UCAS search tool useful to find and compare university courses.
It is much easier to write a concise statement when you are applying to similar courses, especially when you’ve found the one you are most passionate about.
But there’s more to think about than just the course.
Learn about the university and get a feeling for what their campus and community is like.
If you have the opportunity, sign up for Online Open Days and chat to current students .
This is the ultimate way to find out how you feel about the place.
I made sure to apply to as many Open Days as possible, and some of those experiences were the deciding factors on whether I submitted an application or not.
To make the best and biggest impression, learn about the criteria of your course and what those specific course tutors are looking for in an application.
Start with the grades, are they achievable?
Once you feel confident with the academic requirements, explore the university's website to find their tips on applying.
Leeds Beckett provides a helpful application walkthrough .
Scan the web page of your chosen course too.
When doing this I highlighted key words which could indicate what the course tutors are looking for in prospective students.
I could then use this information to put together a good application.
Manually writing down and crossing off the steps of your application can make the process satisfying and easy to follow.
There’s more to think about than just your personal statement; have you put down the correct course?
Have you used all of your university slots?
Have you correctly filled in all of your education history?
Double checking this information with a pen and paper can only help those who easily lose their train of thought.
If a checklist isn’t your thing, a mind map also comes in handy, especially for mapping out your key attributes when statement planning.
I am a very visual learner, so I preferred this method.
I also found that by using a mind map it was easier to expand on points by adding branches, which was very helpful for jotting down ideas for statement content.
Your statement is the most important part of your application because it helps you make your case as to why you should receive a place at your chosen universities.
When I applied to Leeds Beckett University, I wanted to make sure I emphasised all my relevant experience to separate my statement from everyone else’s.
It is very important to back up any points you make with relevant examples.
E.g.
if you wrote; I am very organised, you should use this point to expand and explain where you have used this skill; At my part time job, I applied my organisation skills to manage customer queries and prepare orders .
Make sure that you don’t sound robotic though.
Whether it’s an employer or a course tutor, they want to make sure they’re choosing someone engaging and enthusiastic.
Trust yourself and put your personality into your text.
If the option is available to ask others to review your application, do it!
Parents, siblings, friends or teachers will be happy to help.
They may spot grammar or structural mistakes that you skipped over.
Another essential thing to consider is your reference.
Choose someone who is on your side, and ensure they can see you in a positive light when they write it.
During my application, I asked my tutor (and History teacher) to write my reference.
While the subject he taught wasn’t relevant to my science focused degree, he saw my growth in the last year of college and was confident in my potential.
As this teacher also knew me as an individual, he could recognise and report on my interests and personality.
It takes time to write and process a UCAS application, so make sure you’re organised and prepared to make big decisions.
Your statement and reference are as crucial as your grades, so surround yourself with structure and positivity to get it out of the way and refocus on your subject learning again.
Remember, you don’t need to do it all in one day!
Help yourself by making this process as easy as possible and try not to stress.
Hi, I'm Ellie and I'm a first year Dietetics student and blogger from Dorset.
Contrary to popular belief, my life doesn't revolve around salads!
I enjoy baking, photography, pottery and I am particularly interested in all things sustainable.

Hi, my name is Paige and I’m a mature student studying Human Geography and Planning in the School of Built Environment, Engineering and Computing.
If you’re interested in learning about how this course is preparing me for the workplace then read on.
Everyone has different reasons for going to university.
For me, my career goal is to work in Urban Planning, which is why I chose to study Human Geography and Planning here at Leeds Beckett.
This course is teaching me about the role that planning plays in helping to shape our cities and towns and is arming me with the essential knowledge and skills I need to enter the Urban Planning profession when I graduate.
In this blog I’ll be telling you exactly how my course is preparing me for the workplace and telling you about the brilliant opportunities and experiences I’ve had through studying a degree at Leeds Beckett.
The first way in which the Human Geography and Planning course is preparing me for the workplace is through the modules and topics themselves.
In the first year, one of the modules I studied was Intro to Planning, which involved guest speakers from across Leeds Council’s Planning Department coming in and speaking to us about their roles and responsibilities.
For me, having these guest speakers helped to enhance my learning experiences and show me the type of employability that is available for me after completing the course.
It was also great to connect with people from within the planning industry and have the opportunity to forge professional connections.
I’ve just started my second year and I’m really excited about all of the new modules I'll be studying.
One of my year two modules is called Development of Planning Thought, and I’m looking forward to this in particular because it will help me expand on the professional skillset that I developed in my first year, by giving me a more in-depth understanding of relevant planning laws and policies.
Another key element of the course content is field trips.
I love going on field trips because I get to practically apply the theories I’ve learnt in lectures and I find this incredibly useful for my development.
All of the field trips are also fully funded which is so handy when you’re on a student budget.
Recently, we took a field trip to nearby Micklefield, as part of a module where we were worked in groups to think about and explain how we would develop this village.
The School of Built Environment, Engineering and Computing is very focused on supporting all of the students who study within it, and on my course the lecturers are all active in or have previous experience of working in planning.
This makes me feel confident that my course is preparing me well for a career in planning, because I'm being taught by people with expertise and hands-on experience in the field.
In addition, the facilities and equipment are excellent, and we are given the opportunity to use computer programmes which are the same as those utilised by planners at work.
I recently us ed SPSS research software and geographic information system (GIS) software as part of a case study in one of my modules, and I will be able to use these again in other classes.
When I was choosing which university to study at, it was important to me the course would give me a range of experiences and placement opportunities.
Unsurprisingly my goal is studying a course that prepares me well for the workplace.
As I want to go into a good graduate job when I complete my degree, armed with all the tools and knowledge I need.
This academic year, one of my modules involves a professional placement.
This is something I can’t wait to take part in, I’m looking forward to getting hands-on experience, demonstrating my passion and skills to an employer, and learning so much more about the planning industry.
As a mature student, I don’t want to spend years studying because I want to get into the industry and start progressing my career as soon as I can.
A big selling point for me was that this course at Leeds Beckett gives me the essential placement experience I so want but it’s weaved into my studies, opposed to me having to add a year on to my degree with a twelve-month placement.
Another benefit of this course is that it's accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), and every student on the course is eligible for free student membership of the RTPI.
Student membership gives me access to planning news, learning materials, and events.
As I’m a member, I got a free ticket to the 2022 UK Real Estate Infrastructure and Investment Forum, which very handily is held annually here in Leeds.
This was a great event because I not only saw talks by a wide range of leaders in the built environment sector, but I also got to network and grow my industry contacts.
On the whole, I feel that my course is preparing me very well for the workplace and I love studying here at Leeds Beckett.
When I graduate I feel confident that I’ll be in a good position to start my professional journey in Planning and I honestly can’t wait!
Hi I'm Paige!
I'm a 26-year-old mature student who is passionate about forging a career in the planning industry.

I was the first in my family to attend university, and in this blog I will be talking about my experience researching and applying for university.
If nobody in your family has been to university, and you’re considering applying, or have already submitted your application, then reading my experience may be of interest to you.
As the first person in my family to decide to go to university, it was a slightly daunting but equally exciting experience.
My parents were brought up to focus on working and providing for themselves after they finished school, opposed to pursuing higher education.
However, they have always taught me that I shouldn't take education for granted and I’ve been brought up to value education and its benefits for developing you as a person and helping you pursue a variety of career options.
So when my Sixth Form started talking to us about applying to universities I was really engaged in this, and was eager to find out more about how a university degree would help prepare me for a professional career.
While my friends could ask their parents and siblings about what university is like and get their advice, I wasn’t able to do this as nobody in my family had any experience of applying to or attending university.
If you’re in the same situation, I suggest having a chat with your schools careers advisor or a friendly teacher, as they’ll be able to explain the application process to you clearly and help you think about different courses and careers.
I also found it helpful to chat with my friends who had already applied and gone off to university.
One person who I talked to was my work friend, she was a few years older than me and was able to tell me all about what it’s like moving away from home, living independently, and studying a course you’re passionate about.
She also explained that universities and specific courses have lots of opportunities for students, like work placements and industry connections.
This filled me with excitement, so I went away and did some online research on courses and universities based on the advice and information she’d shared.
As I’m interested in pursuing a career in Public Relations, my research focused on this area.
From reading careers advice online , I could see the benefits of getting a degree in PR, as you’re equipped with the necessary professional knowledge and practical skills you need to succeed in this field.
In addition, from looking at Leeds Beckett’s PR course specification online, I could see that you’re supported with hands-on experience including the opportunity of a twelve-month industry placement.
While I found it quite easy choosing a course, it took me some time to decide on a university.
As this is the place you’re going to be studying and living in for several years, you want to get it right.
While lots of my friends could ask older siblings or parents what particular universities were like to live and study at, I couldn’t do this.
Instead, I visited some of my friends who were already living in Leeds as this gave me the opportunity to get a feel for Leeds Beckett University as well as the overall city.
If you can, I'd suggest visiting the university you're interested in before applying.
When I came to Leeds, I fell in love with the city, the friendly Yorkshire people, and the campus.
I knew that this was a place I wanted to live and could imagine my life as a student here.
When you’re deciding which universities to apply for, I’d suggest making a list of the pros and cons.
As well as this, as part of my research I looked into which universities offered the best course for me in terms of my preferred teaching style, the types of modules I was interested in, and considered whether I felt like I would love living in that university’s particular city.
Every family is different and if you’re the first to go to university in your family you may be unsure how they will react.
I told my parents about my interest in going to university and explained my reasons so they understood.
The conversation went well and they were really supportive.
We chatted about where I may apply and how far away from home I might go, with us all feeling two hours from our home in Wales was the perfect distance - not too close but still not too far away!
We then all went together to visit Leeds on an Applicant Day, these are special days for students who’ve applied to Leeds Beckett, but if you haven’t applied yet then I suggest attending an Open Day where you can tour the campuses and see the facilities.
On this day, my parents were able to see where I wanted to study and learn more about how my course will help me with my future career.
As people who had never been to university before, this helped them get a better understanding of what higher education is all about.
They also came away really positive for me to be embarking on my university journey and said they had a lot of pride in me.
In all honesty, one of my biggest motivations for going to university was to make my family proud.
However, I know that it’s important to make your own decisions and so even though I had this motivating factor, I made sure that university was the right place for me.
I did this by carefully researching the course I was interested in, looking at what the course accreditation meant, and considering graduate outcomes .
Overall, when I made the decision to apply to study at Leeds Beckett I did so because I’m passionate about PR and want to pursue a career in this area.
Knowing that my parents are proud of me is just an added bonus.
I feel lucky to be able to continue my education with the emotional and financial support of my family, and studying for a degree has been my biggest achievement to date.
While I had a lot of excitement when it came to applying for university, one of the things I was a little unsure about was the financial side .
While my family is able to support me to some extent financially, I wouldn’t have been able to attend university and pay the course fees without the loan from Student Finance .
If you’re a little worried like I was initially, or have any questions, then I suggest taking a look at the information about money, fees, and bursaries on Leeds Beckett’s website.
You can also speak directly to the university’s Student Money team by phone, or chat to them in person at one of Leeds Beckett’s Open Days.
At first it may seem daunting thinking about a loan and seeing the amount of money Student Finance is going to pay for your course fees and maintenance loan.
However, you don’t start paying your student loan back until after you graduate and are earning over a set amount.
This is something that I found very reassuring when I was doing my research and, for me, I know that by taking this course I will be opening up new opportunities for myself and it’s an important first step in my PR career.
Overall, university has given me so many opportunities already, including the opportunity to live independently, meet amazing people through my course, gain work experience, and develop my skills.
Most of all, I’m loving learning new things and studying PR and I can’t wait until I can get my first graduate job in the industry.
If you’re thinking about applying to university and you’re going to be the first in your family to do so, my top suggestion would be to do as much research as you can, explain to your parents the reasons why you’re considering university, and if there’s a course you’re passionate about then just go for it and apply.
Hi, I'm Laura, a PR student here at LBU.
Outside of university my interests include fitness, socialising with friends and traveling (anything that benefits my wellbeing really).
I’m passionate about spreading positivity and enjoy motivating people so that they can become the best version of themselves!

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2022/09/how-to-start-preparing-for-applying-to-university:
I’ve been in your shoes and I know what it’s like to start preparing for applying to university.
Which is why I’ve put together this blog, sharing my own personal experiences and top tips to help you.
If you’re starting to think about applying for university, you may be wondering where to start and how to prepare.
In this blog I’ll be sharing my top tips from my experience of when I was in the same position as you.
I found applying to university really exciting, as I was starting to think about that next chapter in my life.
However, there were also a lot of things I needed to think about.
First things first, deadlines.
These are crucial and you don’t want to miss them.
So I suggest getting organised and making a note of all important deadlines now.
You can also set reminders on your phone so you don’t forget.
The main deadline you need to consider is the UCAS application deadline .
The UCAS deadline for applying is 31 January 2024, for 2024 entry, at 6pm.
This is the deadline for the majority of courses, however, there is an earlier deadline date for other selected courses and this information can be found on the UCAS website .
In addition, if you are applying for a course that has a January or July intake, these start dates may affect deadlines.
It’s essential to check the application details when you search for a course on UCAS as applications submitted after the deadline may not be considered.
At my college, our careers advisors and teachers helped us by proofreading our personal statements and they set us a deadline for submitting these to them.
Check if your school or college does this and jot down the deadline they’ve set, as this date will be before the official UCAS deadline in January.
So you’ve made yourself aware of the deadlines and now you’re at the research stage, trying to work out which university and course you want to apply for.
I’d suggest starting by making a list of factors that are important to you, such as a university’s location, the facilities, and if you’re uncertain of which course, think about what you enjoy about the subjects you currently study.
While I saw lots of universities that I felt looked great, what attracted me to Leeds Beckett was the course and its facilities.
I study Interior Architecture & Design in the Broadcasting Place building, which houses studio spaces and multimedia workshop areas.
This, combined with the course content and tutors who have professional experience in the industry, is what convinced me to apply to LBU.
Whether you’re still choosing which course you want to apply for, or you know exactly what you’d like to study, I’d suggest chatting with your school or college careers advisor.
As they can help you understand more about individual courses and the career opportunities connected to them.
They can also support you with researching and will be full of brilliant advice.
As well as getting help from your school or college, Leeds Beckett have put together a handy hub of useful information and advice to support you with your application.
The best way to get a feel for a university is by coming to visit.
At an Open Day, you have the opportunity to explore the campus, view the facilities, attend course talks, and have a look at the accommodation options.
They're really helpful for showing you exactly what life is like living and studying at a particular university.
This autumn, Leeds Beckett are hosting several Open Days .
If you're considering studying here then I'd definitely suggest coming along to one and seeing what life is like at LBU.
Every university sets entry requirements for each of their courses.
You can apply for whatever university and course you want, but if your predicted grades don’t match what the university is looking for then they are more likely to reject your application.
You can find the entry requirements listed on each course page on UCAS.
You’ll also see these on a university’s own website.
Here at Leeds Beckett they use UCAS points in their entry requirements.
The entry requirements for my course were 80 UCAS tariff points, and I was predicted BBB, which works out as 120 points.
This gave me the confidence when I was applying, as I knew I stood a good chance of being offered a place.
If you need help working out how many points your predicted grades are worth, you can always use Leeds Beckett’s handy UCAS points calculator.
In my opinion, there are many benefits to gaining work experience before you apply to university.
For me, gaining some work experience helped me decide what course and career I wanted to pursue.
I did a week-long placement at a sculpture studio and while this did not have a direct link to the course I applied for, working in the studio space and being in that environment confirmed to me that the architectural route was right for me.
Another reason why I think gaining experience is important is because you can demonstrate your passion and commitment for a course in your personal statement.
A university will be very interested to see what experience you have and how it shaped you.
Even if your work experience is unrelated to your course, you will still have learnt something.
Applying for university is an exciting step but I know there’s so much to consider, I hope reading this blog has helped give you a better understanding of how best to prepare.
Overall, I’d say the main thing is to consider your options carefully and always talk to your school, family or friends if you’re feeling in need of some extra support.
Good Luck!

Hey, I'm Zoe, a second year Media, Communications and Cultures student at Leeds Beckett.
Starting university is such an exciting time, but it can also feel a little overwhelming especially if you’re more introverted.
But here’s the good news: you don’t have to dive headfirst into parties and big social scenes to make the most of uni life.
There are so many ways to enjoy Leeds at your own pace.
In this guide, I’ll be sharing my favourite places, tips, and experiences that helped me find my rhythm and enjoy my time in Leeds.
Whether you’re looking for peaceful study spots, low-key social activities, or solo adventures, I’ve got you covered.
When I first arrived in Leeds, I felt totally out of my comfort zone.
I’d moved to a brand new city on my own and I wasn’t sure how I’d fit in, especially since nights out and big social events aren’t really my thing.
I remember thinking, “ What if I don’t click with anyone?
” or “ Will people think I’m boring just because I prefer a quiet coffee shop to a club?
”.
I soon learnt there are so many ways to enjoy university life as an introvert and so many others who feel exactly the same way.
I started by wandering around the city centre at my own pace, soaking in the atmosphere, and learning where everything was.
It was a nice way to get to know the city without feeling pressured by crowds or events.
What I loved most was discovering the little pockets of calm amidst the city’s energy - places that felt like a refuge when I needed some peace.
One of my favourite places to visit is the Corn Exchange.
It’s such a charming spot, filled with independent shops and unique food spots.
Whether I’m treating myself to a coffee or just window shopping, it’s a perfect place to spend a relaxing afternoon.
There’s something really comforting about being in a space that’s busy enough to feel alive but quiet enough to enjoy a moment on my own.
Another spot I love for solo adventures is Kirkstall Abbey.
It’s a bit outside the city centre, but it’s totally worth the visit.
The ruins are beautiful, and it’s so peaceful walking through the grounds.
I’ve spent hours there just walking around, thinking, or even reading a book.
It was one of the first places that made Leeds feel like home for me.
Of course, there’s also Roundhay Park, which I’m sure many students will recommend.
I often go there to clear my head, take in the greenery, and even watch the swans on the lake.
It’s a great place to feel like you’re getting away from the city, but you’re still so close to everything.
If there’s one thing I quickly realised about Leeds, it’s that it’s a city that truly caters to us introverts, especially if you love coffee and books like I do.
One of my favourite spots is Waterstones in the city centre.
With three floors of books and a cosy café, I could spend hours there, either reading or getting some work done in peace.
And, of course, there’s Café Brigante.
It’s at the bottom of Briggate and has the best tiramisu I’ve ever had in my life.
Honestly, just writing this makes me want to go back!
It’s a quiet, relaxed place that feels like a secret gem.
Whether I’m meeting a friend or just grabbing something to go, it’s one of those places I keep coming back to.
Sometimes it’s nice to just sit there with a book, drink my coffee, and watch the world go by.
Then there’s Sonder Café, which has a calm, artsy vibe that I absolutely love.
It’s the perfect place for an afternoon pick-me-up with some of the best pastries in town.
It’s also a great spot to bring a notebook and do a little journaling or planning.
On some days, I’ll go there when I need to clear my head and just soak in the peaceful atmosphere.
There’s a kind of magic to spending time in places like this, where the world slows down a bit, and you can just be.
But the cherry on top for me is always finding a café that feels like home.
I’ve made my way to so many little spots around Leeds, and every time I discover a new one, it gives me the biggest serotonin boost.
Whether it’s the perfect spot for a quiet moment of reflection or a place to meet someone for a low-key catch-up, Leeds has no shortage of spots that make you feel right at home, even when you’re flying solo.
If the thought of nights out and crowded clubs doesn’t appeal to you, don’t worry - there are plenty of ways to meet new people without stepping too far out of your comfort zone.
One of my favourite activities is the Run Club at BOX Bar, which meets every Wednesday evening.
It’s a relaxed 5k run through some of the most scenic parts of Leeds, and it’s a great way to get moving while meeting others who enjoy a more active lifestyle.
After the run, you can grab discounted food and drinks, and it’s a nice, easy way to socialise without the pressure of big events.
Leeds Beckett has a huge range of clubs, from book clubs to sports teams, and it’s an excellent way to meet people who share similar interests.
Another great way to connect with others is by joining a community.
Whether you're into writing, fitness, or something more niche, there’s a community for you.
Plus, it’s a fun way to get involved without having to commit to large social gatherings if that’s not your thing.
There are also tons of student events that are less about partying and more about enjoying something low-key, like quiz nights, craft workshops, or movie screenings.
It’s all about finding the activities that align with your vibe and slowly stepping into new social circles at your own pace.
Leeds is a fantastic city to explore, it’s got the perfect balance of bustling energy and peaceful spots, so you can enjoy your own company while still having the chance to step outside your comfort zone when you're ready.
Whether it’s discovering new places to unwind or finding low-key ways to connect with others, Leeds has something for everyone, even us folk who prefer the quiet side of life.
I hope these tips help you feel more comfortable and excited about your time at Leeds Beckett.
University life doesn’t have to follow any set path - it’s about figuring out what works best for you, whether that’s embracing quiet moments or finding new ways to meet people in your own time.
Trust me, you’ll find your vibe, and before long you’ll be making the most of everything this city has to offer.

Hi, I'm Matilda, a third-year English and History student at Leeds Beckett.
If you’re moving away from home, halls are an exciting part of the university experience.
Here’s a guide filled with top tips and my personal experiences to help you make the most of living in halls!
Living in shared accommodation is a huge part of the first-year university experience.
Personally, I wasn’t too worried about it, as I’d always been used to sharing spaces.
However, the real preparation for halls began in the summer before I even left my parents’ house.
After accepting my offer, I was invited to choose my accommodation through the fantastic accommodation portal provided by Beckett.
Due to me accepting my offer I was guaranteed a place in university accommodation and also had the chance to have an input on who I was going to be living with.
I filled out a questionnaire, and based on my answers, I was given a few options for flats.
I decided to go with the first one that came up, which already had two flat mates confirmed.
Soon after, a WhatsApp group was created for our flat, and we’ve been friends ever since.
Over the summer, I spent time learning some new recipes to cook and getting everything I needed for my room.
Before I knew it, September arrived, and moving day was here!
After saying an emotional goodbye to my family, I found myself alone in a new city.
But here’s where I share the first of my top tips: I had stocked up on crisps, salsa, and my beverage of choice, and spent that first night chatting with the two other people in my flat.
This is one of my biggest pieces of advice for anyone moving into university halls — try to reach out to the people you’re living with.
Living alone can feel isolating, but by trying to build relationships with your flat mates, even if you don’t become best friends, you’ll feel much more at ease in your new home for the year.
Another important tip I’d recommend is not to overpack.
It’s easy to spend hours scrolling through packing lists online, but I’d suggest thinking carefully before bringing things you don’t immediately need — especially when it comes to kitchenware and utensils.
The one exception would be room decorations.
I’d recommend bringing a few to make your room feel more like home.
And if you forget something or realise you need it, there’s always a homeware shop nearby.
You could even make a flat trip out of it with your new friends to pick up whatever you need collectively.
One of my favourite memories from my first year was spending Christmas with my two flat mates.
We went to Morrisons, picked up a roast-in-the-bag chicken and other bits, and enjoyed a full three-course meal while opening presents.
The Halloween before, we had a great time carving pumpkins together.
If you get along with your flat mates, I highly recommend celebrating holidays together and decorating your flat as a group, whether it’s putting up a Christmas tree or decking out your door with crime scene tape, these little traditions can make your time together feel more special.
For me, it was these moments that made my experience much less isolating and a lot more fun.
Halls are often quite basic, but they offer a blank canvas to make the space feel like your own.
Adding personal touches can transform your room into a much more inviting and homely place, which really helps with any potential feelings of homesickness.
I remember bringing along some of the decorations from my room at my parents’ house, and it made all the difference.
University halls can sometimes get a reputation for being messy, especially if your flat mates aren’t as tidy or quiet as you’d like.
However, if you set expectations and share responsibilities with the flat mates who are on board with keeping common areas clean, things can run smoothly.
While mess and rubbish can build up, my biggest tip is to focus on building strong relationships with your flat mates.
When things need to be done around the flat, having open and friendly conversations can help keep everything in balance.
If I were to share one thing I wish I had done differently, it would be setting clearer boundaries around cleaning.
I spent a lot of time tidying up after others and wiping down surfaces, which, while helpful, did leave me feeling a bit drained, especially with university work on top of that.
In hindsight, I’d recommend balancing responsibilities more evenly from the start, so everyone contributes, and you don’t burn out trying to do it all yourself.
At the end of the day, while living with new people can come with its challenges, there are plenty of ways to make the experience a positive one.
I truly believe that Leeds Beckett does its best to ensure students have a great time, especially by pairing people with similar interests.
Looking back on my time in accommodation, I can honestly say it was a really positive experience.
I met my two best friends through university halls, and it was a time of personal growth — not just for me as an individual, but also as someone learning to live with others.
My best piece of advice is to use the accommodation portal to connect with people you click with and meet them beforehand.
Once you move in, keep extending the olive branch — whether it’s by leaving your door open when you’re in your room or hanging out in the kitchen while others are cooking.
Ultimately, you want your hall to feel like a comfortable, fun space to return to after a long day at university.

Hey, I’m Luke, and I study English & Creative Writing at Leeds Beckett.
Student life often comes with the connotations of pot noodles, dirty bedrooms and surviving on pennies.
But it doesn’t have to be that way - sure, it’s not all luxury, but with a bit of budgeting, some smart hacks, and a few money-saving tricks, you can make student life work your way!
Living in Leeds comes with plenty of perks — friendly northern vibes, top notch comfort food, and some pretty decent weather.
With students making up over 30% of the city’s population, you’re in good company when it comes to finding budget-friendly spots.
So, let’s dive into some student favourites that won’t break the bank!
Aldi and Lidl — no contest.
They’re the go-to for budget-friendly, fresh food with plenty of options for all diets.
Even with my pricier vegan shop, I still keep my weekly spend between £30-£40.
If you’ve got the time (and the phone storage), taking advantage of Clubcards, Nectar points, and other reward schemes is an easy way to save.
I always do a quick scroll through StudentBeans while making my shopping list  —it’s a game-changer for catching daily deals and avoiding unnecessary splurges!
One of the best things about Leeds?
You can pretty much walk everywhere.
When I first came to Beckett, I thought I’d be spending loads of money on buses, but it turns out if you’re living nearby you don’t really need them.
That said, on those days when the walk just isn’t happening (we’ve all been there), Leeds Beckett has you covered with a free student bus running between City and Headingley Campus on weekdays during term time.
And if you do need to hop on public transport, it won’t break the bank.
I think Leeds has a really affordable public transport system, with student discounts available on buses and trains.
A monthly travel pass can cost less than a few takeaway coffees, and if you book train tickets in advance or grab a 16-25 Railcard, you can save even more.
Unless you’re off to Tropical World or Elland Road, everything you need is right in the city centre.
On a tight budget?
Trust me  —your trainers will be your best investment.
Leeds is packed with free (or ridiculously cheap) things to do between lectures — you just need to know where to look.
I took a quick scroll through my banking app and last month I spent £20 on a haircut, £35 on books, and £25 on football tickets.
But you know what didn’t show up?
The afternoon I played tennis at Headingley Campus, the time I spotted a tiger at Leeds City Museum, or the peaceful walk I took to feed the ducks at Yeadon Tarn.
Why?
Because they didn’t cost me a penny.
And that’s just the start—Leeds is full of hidden gems that won’t drain your student budget.
You can explore Leeds Art Gallery for free, wander through the Victorian arcades (window shopping counts, right?), or head up to Roundhay Park for a scenic study break.
Need to clear your head?
Take a hike up to Otley Chevin for some of the best views of the city.
From pop-up markets to live music in Hyde Park Book Club, there’s always something going on, and often, it’s free.
So, if you're worried about finding things to do on a budget — Leeds has you covered.
Lunch is the ultimate money saver - I’m in my third year, and — embarrassingly — it’s taken me this long to realise the easiest way to save money: bring your own lunch.
Your timetable will give you breaks, and let’s be honest, your seminar tutors won’t mind if you sneak in a sandwich.
Skip the £3.75 meal deal, throw together a sandwich while the kettle’s boiling, and you’re already winning at student budgeting.
Shop smart, shop together - Some things just aren’t practical (or affordable) to buy solo.
Living in a tiny flat, I don’t have the space for 18 rolls of toilet paper, and I definitely don’t have the budget to buy them in smaller, overpriced packs.
The solution?
Team up with your housemates.
Bulk-buy essentials, split the cost, and save money for the things that actually matter.
Also, one golden rule  —make a shopping list and stick to it.
Tempting as it is, the Lidl bakery will still be there next time.
Budget, but don’t forget to live - Yes, student life means keeping an eye on your spending, but don’t let it stop you from enjoying yourself.
Missing one night out because you’re a little skint isn’t the end of the world — everyone’s in the same boat.
As long as you’re happy, healthy, and making memories, no one expects you to have a stacked savings account just yet.
Accept help when you need it - I get it — moving away means you want to prove you’re independent.
But let’s be real: managing money is a learning curve, and no one gets it right straight away.
If family or student support services offer a helping hand, take it.
It doesn’t mean you’re failing; it just means you’re figuring things out.
And that’s exactly what uni is for.
It’s understandable that the last thing we want to do is tell our already teary loved ones is that we’re out of money after the first week.
Don’t worry though, this is all new and you’re not going to be perfect at it straight away.
If the help’s there, take it with a smile and a hug!
So, is it expensive to be a student in Leeds?
Ultimately, if you’re smart with your money and take advantage of the discounts and free activities on offer, living as a student in Leeds can be both affordable and enjoyable.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2025/02/do-applicant-days-matter:
I’m Chloe, a second-year Marketing Management student at Leeds Beckett University, and I’m here to share why Applicant Days were such a key part of my decision to study here.
My Applicant Day was a game-changer, it gave me the clarity I needed during the decision-making process because I felt as though it provided me with way more detailed information than the Open Day and gave me valuable insights into what university life would be like, plus what my Marketing Management course would actually look like over the next three years.
A chance to learn & connect Your Applicant Day is such an amazing opportunity to get a real feel for your course and meet the people behind it.
It’s so much more detailed and personal than the Open Day.
You’ll have the chance to chat with your future classmates, lecturers, and course leaders, which really helps you get a sense of the teaching styles, course content, and what life on campus is actually like.
It’s not just about learning what’s in the course—it’s about seeing if it feels like the right fit for you.
For me, during my Applicant Day , I remember sitting down with my future course leader and talking through the modules in more depth than I’d ever seen online.
That one conversation completely changed the way I viewed the course, and it helped me picture what the next few years would look like.
It wasn’t just a “this is what you’ll study” session — it was a “here’s how it all connects to real-life marketing and your future career.” It made me feel way more confident in my choice and excited for what was to come.
Interactive & insightful sessions
One of the highlights of the Applicant Day is the chance to engage in activities with other students who have applied for the same course as you.
When I attended the Marketing Management session I remember feeling a bit nervous at first, but as soon as I started chatting with a few students during one of the ice-breaker activities, I realised we all had similar questions and interests about university life.
We ended up bonding over shared experiences and even swapped social media handles!
It was such a relief to know that everyone else was just as excited and nervous as I was.
Understanding key support & resources
The Applicant Day also gave me a chance to learn about the different support resources available to students, which was something I hadn’t fully considered before.
One of the things that stood out to me was finding out about the financial support options available, as someone who was feeling a bit anxious about the cost of university, hearing about scholarships, grants, and budgeting tips from the team really helped ease my worries.
It made me realise that there’s a lot of support out there to ensure students aren’t left struggling financially.
Another major benefit was being able to discuss my disability with my course leader in a one-on-one setting.
That conversation made such a difference to my overall sense of belonging.
It was reassuring to know that Leeds Beckett is not only aware of the challenges students with disabilities face, but they are also proactive in providing the right support.
After that chat, I felt so much more confident about how I would be supported throughout my course, and I knew I would have access to everything I needed to thrive.
It also gave me a clearer understanding of the university’s broader resources, from mental health support to academic tutoring, and how they could help me succeed in my studies.
Overall, knowing that I had a solid support network behind me made me feel so much more prepared and accepted as part of the Leeds Beckett community.
Another chance to explore
If you didn’t have time to explore everything during your Open Day, this is your chance to dig deeper into those areas.
There’s a lot to take in, so it’s important to plan ahead and pick the talks that matter most to you—this will help you get the most out of the day.
Leeds Beckett sends out detailed emails before the event, so you’ll have a list of all the sessions to choose from.
You can really tailor your day to focus on what’s most important to you—whether that’s career advice, understanding student life, or exploring all the support options available.
And if you’re looking to spend a bit more time soaking in the city, make sure to factor in some time to explore Leeds too!
It’s a great opportunity to get a feel for the surroundings, from cafes to shops and everything inbetween — something you might not have had time for during your Open Day.
So, do Applicant Days matter?
Absolutely!
They give you a clearer understanding of what life at university will be like, helping you feel more confident in your decision.
Plus, you can plan your day to focus on the things that matter most to you — whether it’s support services, career opportunities, or just getting to know your future campus.
For me, the Applicant Day made a huge impact on my decision making, and I’m so glad I took the time to attend.

Leeds is super well connected, whether you’re traveling by bus or train — it’s so easy to get around!
Here’s a little hack I wish I’d known earlier in my first year: student tickets!
For trains, you can grab a railcard to save loads on travel, and for buses, you can just ask the driver for a student ticket.
Just make sure you’ve got a physical student ID with you (UniDays won’t cut it!).
If you want to make life even easier, I’d recommend downloading the ‘First Bus’ app — it’s a game-changer for buying student tickets quickly!

The city is packed with big brand names, sustainable local shops, and amazing shopping centres, so there’s always somewhere new to explore.
My personal favourite has to be Trinity — it’s right in the heart of the city, has pretty much everything you could need, and it’s super convenient.
Here’s a tip I learned pretty early on: always ask if a shop does student discounts!

Most of the clubs in Leeds have dedicated student nights with cheap entry and drinks deals, so it won’t break the bank.

Another favourite of mine is Junkyard Golf, a quirky, glow-in-the-dark mini-golf course with funky themes.
If you’re looking for something outdoorsy, Leeds has some fantastic options.
Roundhay Park is a beautiful spot for an evening walk, especially around the lake or in the woodlands — it’s so peaceful, and you can even catch the sunset on a clear day.

I’ll be honest — I had no idea how expensive groceries could be until I came to uni!
Back in my first year, I used to shop exclusively at Sainsbury’s without even using their Nectar card (big mistake, I know).
It didn’t take long for me to realise that I needed to be a bit smarter about where I shopped to save money.
For me, Aldi and Morrisons have been lifesavers — they’re incredibly affordable for everyday essentials.
If you’re looking for frozen food or snacks, Iceland and Food Warehouse are brilliant for finding cheap options and stocking up.
I’ve learned to mix it up a bit too — sometimes I’ll pop into Sainsbury’s or Tesco for specific things, but for the big food shops, I try to stick to the more budget-friendly places.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2025/01/things-to-consider-whilst-applying-for-university:
Hi, my name is Chloe, and I am a second-year Marketing Management student.
The prospect of attending university is exciting but can be daunting, there are numerous aspects to consider when applying.
Through my own experience, there are things that I wish I had thought of earlier, I will be sharing my thoughts on the key considerations for university applications throughout this blog.
To begin with, I suggest carefully considering the location of the university you’re applying to.
For me, this was the most significant factor during my application journey to Leeds Beckett.
The location of your university doesn’t just determine where you’ll live; it shapes your entire student experience.
I wanted to strike a balance between being far enough from home to feel independent, yet close enough to visit when needed without too much hassle or expense.
Travel costs and accessibility were especially important to me because I knew I’d need to return home occasionally — whether for family events, holidays, or simply to recharge.
The thought of dealing with long journeys or unaffordable travel made location a key priority in my decision.
Travelling between Leeds and my home town can be quite costly if left until last minute, I quickly realised that planning ahead was essential.
Train tickets booked months in advance are far cheaper, but even then, they sometimes sell out during peak seasons.
Over time, I found that coaches were a more cost-effective alternative.
However, my early experiences of travelling home were quite challenging.
The first few times, I had to pass through London with all my belongings, which was both stressful and physically demanding.
Eventually, I discovered a train route that takes me directly to my home town, where someone can pick me up — this has made the journey far more manageable and less overwhelming.
Ultimately, choosing a university location that aligns with your personal needs and circumstances can make a huge difference to your overall experience.
It’s worth taking the time to think about how manageable the distance will be for you, how often you plan to travel home, and whether the costs fit your budget.
Building on the importance of location, I would also advise considering the ease of accessing the essential services you’ll need while at university.
As someone with a disability, it was vital for me to have a doctor’s surgery and pharmacy close by, as well as an efficient sign-up process for medical services.
Thankfully, this turned out to be no issue for me.
Leeds offers all these essential services, including a dedicated student medical practice for emergencies.
This practice operates late into the night to address the unique needs of students, which has been incredibly reassuring.
In addition to external services, it’s important to evaluate the university’s own support systems, whether this is something you investigate during the application process or something you may need later on.
Leeds Beckett is highly proactive in offering support for students facing mental health challenges and those with physical disabilities.
My personal experiences with both their mental health and disability support teams have been exceptional — they consistently provide care and resources that have genuinely enhanced my student experience.
It's equally important to think about maintaining a strong personal support network during your time at university.
Consider how easy it will be to stay connected with family and friends — is the university’s location convenient for communication, or might the distance create barriers?
Prioritising your mental health throughout your university journey is essential.
For me, while I found comfort in the independence and the chance to start afresh, staying in close contact with my family made a significant difference.
During my first year, I made it a point to call my family every day, and this connection was invaluable for my mental health and well-being.
Everyone’s needs are different, but striking a balance between independence and a supportive network is key to thriving during this new chapter.
I would highly recommend taking the time to think carefully about the area you’ll be relocating to or commuting from.
For me, this was a big part of my decision-making process, as I wanted to make sure the location would truly suit me — not just academically, but personally as well.
There are a few key questions that helped me decide:
Answering these questions helped me picture what life would be like day-to-day, and it gave me the confidence to know I was making the right choice.
Relocating or commuting is a big step, but if you take the time to think it through and focus on what matters most to you, you’ll set yourself up for a much better experience.
University can be expensive, so it’s important to plan ahead.
For me, applying for student finance early provided peace of mind and helped shape my decisions.
If you’re considering part-time work, I highly recommend attending job fairs and exploring online platforms.
Securing an on-campus job gave me financial stability and valuable experience while enhancing my university journey.
It’s also worth investigating the financial assistance your university offers, such as bursaries or loans, and evaluating your budgeting skills.
Finally, take time to find accommodation that fits your financial situation.
Feeling secure in your choice can ease the transition and let you focus on your studies.
Being proactive about finances will help you make the most of university life without unnecessary worry.
Starting university in a new environment made me anxious about making friends — it was constantly on my mind.
What I wish I’d known during the application process is how many platforms are available to connect with classmates and roommates ahead of time.
Being proactive on social media, like TikTok , Instagram , and Facebook is a great place to start, the university also invites all applicants to a community group where you can find your flat mates, course mates and create group chats like whatsapp based on interests - this can really help ease those nerves and even lead to meeting future friends.
In my experience, the welcoming atmosphere at Leeds Beckett made all the difference.

Hi, I'm Maitri, an Indian student staying in the UK.
New Year's is that time of the year when the year slowly winds up and brings along a tide of reflection, excitement, and celebration.
Though my celebrations back home in India are steeped in rich cultural traditions, living in the UK added a unique twist to how I ring in the new year.
Let me take you through how I celebrate, blending the best of both worlds!
New Year's celebrations in India vary from region to region, but for me, it has always been about family, food, and rituals.
Traditionally, we celebrate Diwali, the Hindu New Year, but the global excitement around January 1 also means a fresh start, and I always look forward to ringing it in with my loved ones.
Back home, there is a big family dinner amid scrumptious foods: samosas, pulao, paneer tikka, and sweets such as Gulab jamun and kheer.
These dishes have a meaning associated with them; sweets are to denote the sweetness of life, and saltier dishes are just to wish prosperity and a fortune filled year ahead.
Of course, the whole evening is filled with fireworks and the sound of music and laughter.
The air buzzes with excitement as families meet together to celebrate the advent of a new year.
Even though I'm now in the UK, these food traditions and the sense of family have remained close to my heart.
I still try to keep the spirit alive, cooking some of my favourite dishes or sharing them with my friends here.
It's my way of staying connected to my roots.
Being away from home on New Year's Eve can be a bit of a challenge.
But as much as the familiar sounds of firecrackers and warmth of family mean to me, I have grown to embrace the celebration here in the UK.
The British way of celebrating New Year's Eve especially the iconic London fireworks display is something I never imagined I'd experience.
Here in the UK, I usually celebrate with friends by either going out to watch the fireworks or hosting a small gathering at my place.
It is such a great mix of cultures!
We often start the evening by watching the Big Ben countdown, which is just so thrilling to see live, followed by a toast with sparkling wine or champagne at midnight.
It's sort of a cultural mashup, but it's always fun and full of excitement!
The unique part of celebrating in the UK is the multiculturalism  people have been coming from all over the world, and it gives an opportunity to hear how everyone celebrates New Year's, either with fireworks, a special meal, or other customs.
I love hearing about other cultures' unique traditions, and it makes me feel like I'm part of a global celebration.
As an Indian student in the UK, food always makes a huge part of my celebration.
Be it not the whole typical Indian meal that we would have had back home, I try cooking some of my favourite dishes or go out to have lunch or dinner with my friends at some Indian restaurant.
There's something so soothing when biryani, butter chicken, or chole bhature sound appealing when the weather outside is cold and actually makes me feel at home.
But I’ve also learned to love British New Year’s snacks—sausage rolls, fish and chips, and the ubiquitous pint of ale.
It’s a strange but enjoyable fusion of Indian spice and British comfort food.
Sometimes, I’ll even bring these two worlds together—serving both British nibbles and traditional Indian sweets at a party.
It's always a hit!
While I can't be with my family in India, technology has made it so much easier to stay connected.
On New Year's Eve, I make sure to video call my parents, grandparents, and relatives to wish them a Happy New Year.
It's not the same as celebrating together in person, but hearing their voices and sharing in the excitement of their celebrations helps bridge the gap.
It is as if I am still a part of that big family gathering even when miles away from home.
We go over the past year that has gone by and what we look forward to in the new one; it's always emotional and an uplifting moment.
Whether in India or the UK, the spirit of New Year's celebration is reflection and renewal.
It is a time of reflection over the past year and thinking about new changes that need to be made for the coming year.
To me, New Year's has more to do with growth: personal, academic.
Being an international student, there's always a challenge in adjusting to a new culture, but there is also the opportunity for growth, making new friends, and experiencing life in a new country.
While I adore my family's traditions, I have learned to appreciate the different ways in which New Year's is celebrated here.
It is a question of blending both worlds—keeping the old traditions alive while creating new memories in a new place.
That's what makes this time of year so special.
So, whether I’m celebrating with a grand family meal in India or sharing a quiet moment with friends here in the UK, New Year’s is always a time of reflection, joy, and hope for the future.
It’s about embracing the old and the new, keeping my cultural traditions alive while adapting to life in the UK.
I’m thankful for the opportunity to experience the best of both worlds.
To all those reading this and away from home this New Year, wherever you are, the New Year brings with it the promise of new beginnings, personal growth, and great adventure.
I wish you all a prosperous, happy, and fulfilling year ahead that is full of new experiences, growth, and happiness.
Happy New Year!
Hi I'm Maitri, an international student from India.
I have a passion for adventure, creativity and making new connections.

I'm Saritha and as an Indian international student studying in Leeds, UK, celebrating Christmas away from home is an emotional mix of excitement and nostalgia.
Back home in India, Christmas wasn’t a big part of my cultural landscape, but it always felt special—a time to gather with friends, indulge in festive food, and soak in the holiday cheer in our own way.
Last year, I sought that Christmas magic in Edinburgh, spending four memorable days amidst its enchanting markets and historic streets.
But this year, I’ve decided to stay in Leeds, embracing the challenge of making the holiday season feel like home.
And trust me, it’s shaping up to be just as magical.
One of the first things that pulled me into the Christmas spirit this year was the Leeds Christmas Market at Millennium Square.
The festive atmosphere is contagious—twinkling fairy lights, the aroma of hot chocolate, and the cheerful hum of carol singers make it impossible not to feel the holiday joy.
Strolling through the market with friends, I discovered unique handmade gifts, indulged in hot chocolate (with extra marshmallows, of course), and even tried a bratwurst for the first time.
It’s become a weekly ritual—a little escape from coursework and a reminder that Leeds, with its multicultural vibrance, is my home for now.
Back in India, Christmas cakes are a tradition in many households, even if you’re not Christian.
The rich, spiced plumcake brings back memories of bakeries filled with the scent of cinnamon, cloves, and dried fruits soaked in rum.
This year, I decided to take on the challenge of baking my own Christmas cake with friends.
It was messy, chaotic, and filled with laughter—exactly how traditions should begin.
As we mixed the ingredients and waited for the cake to bake, the smell filled our apartment, transforming it into a cozy little corner of the world that felt like home.
Putting up a Christmas tree wasn’t something I did back home, but it’s a tradition I’ve fully embraced here.
This year, I bought a small tree and decorated it with fairy lights and baubles, each ornament a reminder that I’m building new memories.
There’s something magical about turning on the lights for the first time and seeing the tree glow in the corner of my room.
It’s a simple act, but it fills the space with warmth and a sense of belonging.
One of my favourite parts of the holiday season in Leeds has been the shopping.
From Trinity Leeds to the charming independent stores in the Corn Exchange, there’s no shortage of places to find gifts for friends (and maybe a little something for myself).
Walking through the city, with its festive lights and bustling streets, I’ve discovered a side of Leeds I hadn’t noticed before.
It’s a city that comes alive during Christmas, and being part of it has made me feel like I belong here.
For international students like me, friends become family during the holidays.
We may come from different countries and backgrounds, but we share the experience of being far from home.
This year, my friends and I have planned a cozy Christmas Eve—cooking a meal that blends our cultures, exchanging small gifts, and watching Christmas movies late into the night.
It’s these moments that remind me that home isn’t a place; it’s the people you share it with.
Spending Christmas away from home can be challenging, but it’s also an opportunity to create new traditions, explore new cultures, and discover new parts of yourself.
Leeds has given me that chance, and I’m embracing it with open arms.
So, to anyone spending the holidays away from home: Remember that home is where you choose to make it.
Bake that cake, put up that tree, explore your city, and surround yourself with friends who make you feel loved.
This Christmas, Leeds is my home, and I’m excited to see what memories I’ll create here.
And who knows?
Maybe one day, I’ll look back at this time as the start of a new tradition—a tradition of finding joy, wherever life takes me.
Happy Holidays to all!

If you’re wondering how to make the most of the holidays, my name is Jeffery and I’ve got you covered with some tips and ideas for enjoying Christmas in this vibrant city.
The holidays can be a bit challenging.
It’s easy to feel a touch of homesickness when family and familiar traditions seem so far away.
But the festive season in Leeds offers a magical experience that can make you feel right at home.
Luckily, Leeds Beckett University (LBU) always goes the extra mile to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, especially during Christmas.
When I first came to the UK, I kept hearing about how breath-taking cities are during Christmas.
The twinkling lights, festive decorations, and cosy vibes create an enchanting atmosphere.
One of the main highlights of Christmas in the UK is the tradition of Christmas markets.
A little history lesson -
Christmas markets are a festive tradition that originated in “The Christmas market’s roots stretch back to Vienna in 1296, when Duke Albrecht I authorized 14-day fairs in the month of December” (Smithsonian Magazine).
It’s hard to say when the first markets began and then transferred to a more Christmas-themed tradition: “Scholars are often reluctant to definitively identify the first official Christmas market.
(Cities themselves are less reticent, with Dresden proudly proclaiming its title of ‘the oldest Christmas market in Germany.’)
Still, Spennemann and Parker note that ‘continually operating annual markets’ include the Dresden Striezelmarkt, which started in 1434, and the Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt, which began no later than 1628” (Smithsonian Magazine).
Over time, they spread across Europe, becoming a hallmark of the holiday season.
These markets typically feature wooden stalls selling handcrafted gifts, festive decorations, and traditional foods.
In the UK, Christmas markets became popular in the late 20th century and have since grown into major seasonal events, bringing a taste of European charm to British cities.
Leeds hosts some of the best markets in the country, offering plenty of opportunities to enjoy the festive spirit.
Leeds transforms into a winter wonderland during the holidays, with festive lights illuminating the city streets.
Two main markets stand out:
Millennium Square Christmas Market: Millennium Square hosts the Leeds German Christmas Market, also known as Christkindelmarkt.
This market is inspired by traditional Bavarian markets, featuring wooden chalets.
Stalls brim with unique gifts like handmade ornaments, jewelry, and toys.
You’ll also find authentic German treats like bratwurst, schnitzel, and strudel.
Don’t forget to try out the ski bar for some mulled wine and hot chocolate.
City Square Christmas Market: City Square has a delightful Christmas market as well.
It’s a great spot for a relaxed experience.
Here, you’ll find a mix of local vendors offering Yorkshire specialties alongside festive goodies.
Beyond the markets, Leeds city centre dazzles with festive window displays, an ice-skating rink in Millennium Square.
Celebrating Christmas in Leeds as a student can be a heart-warming experience.
It’s an opportunity to immerse yourself in local traditions, meet new people, and create lasting memories.
Exploring the city during Christmas also gives you a chance to learn more about British culture.
From the traditions of pulling Christmas crackers to sipping mulled wine, the festive season here is full of charm.
It’s also a time when people are more cheerful and welcoming, making it the perfect season for new friendships.
No Christmas experience is complete without seasonal treats.
Here are some must-tries at the Leeds Christmas markets:
Food:
Drinks:
Leeds during Christmas time is an unforgettable experience, full of warmth, lights, and festive cheer.

Hello everyone, my name is Annie and today I'm going to talk about what it's like being an international student spending Christmas away from my home country and family.
To be honest, this isn’t my first Christmas spent away from home, but it’s only my second time celebrating the holidays as a university student in the UK.
And I’ve got to say, it hits very differently.
There’s a big difference between traveling to a dream destination for Christmas and staying somewhere because you just can’t make it home for the holidays.
While Christmas in the UK is undeniably magical, with its twinkling lights and festive charm, it’s not the same when you’re away from your loved ones.
I miss my family, of course, but I also really miss my “Coco”—my 7-year-old ball of white fluff —who’s been part of the holiday magic back home in the past years.
Spending Christmas in Leeds, far from the sunny summer vibes of Chile, has made me appreciate what the holiday season means to me on a whole new level.
The UK’s chilly weather and sparkling decorations feel like an entirely different world compared to the warmth and sunshine I’m used to.
Oh, and I forgot one big plus—sipping hot chocolate, indulging in biscuits, and seeing Santa wrapped up in his thick red suit makes so much more sense in this weather!
It feels like stepping into a holiday movie—fuzzy socks and all.
Haha!
Back in Chile, my hometown sits between the Pacific Ocean and the desert.
For me, Christmas has always been about summer vibes: celebrating outdoors, heading to the beach, and firing up the barbecue (we call it a Chilean asados).
I know—it sounds totally crazy, right?
So, when I experienced my first Christmas in the UK, the freezing cold came as a huge shock!
Suddenly, I was layering up like a polar bear, throwing on scarves, gloves, and the iconic Xmas jumper I’d only ever seen in movies.
It was a huge change, but I’ve grown to love this warm fuzzy feeling that comes with wrapping up in blankets and embracing the season’s festive cheer.
It’s different, sure, but that difference has a charm of its own— it’s like finding a hidden cosiness amid the cold, and it makes the experience uniquely special.
Speaking of warmth, I’ve been lucky enough to connect with other international students who couldn’t make it home either.
We’ve created our own little holiday crew in our student shared house, and spending the season together has made Christmas feel a lot less lonely.
If you’re lucky enough to see snow, don’t miss the chance to build a snowman (fan of social media?
snap some Insta-worthy pictures!), sip on the best hot drink, and just have fun.
Those little moments will stick with you forever.
One of the best parts of being in the UK for Christmas is exploring all the holiday traditions.
The Christmas markets in Leeds are a must for students on a budget.
Picture yourself wandering through charming stalls, sipping mulled wine, toasting marshmallows, and nibbling on festive treats—all while soaking up the twinkling holiday vibes.
It’s also a great way to take a breather escape the stress of exams and indulge in a little seasonal joy.
Feeling adventurous?
If your budget stretches a bit further, a trip to London’s Winter Wonderland or a day in Edinburgh during the festive season will blow you away with their Christmas magic.
But staying closer to home doesn’t mean missing out, don’t worry—York and Manchester’s Christmas markets are just as enchanting.
With a bit of planning, they’re totally student-friendly, too.
For me, Christmas has never been about fancy presents.
It’s about spending time with the people you love most.
So yeah, homesickness definitely hits hard—especially when Christmas dinner doesn’t include Mum’s cooking, or when you can’t hug your family and share those small, special moments with them.
And for me, it’s even tougher because my mum’s birthday falls during the Christmas season.
Not being there to celebrate with her makes the distance feel so much more nostalgic.
Thankfully, video calls make the distance a little more bearable.
Keeping in touch with my family in Chile during the holidays has been a lifeline.
It’s not the same, of course, but seeing their faces and hearing their laughter over the screen reminds me that love travels far beyond borders.
At the end of the day, spending Christmas away from home is all about embracing new experiences.
This is a new chapter in my life, and the new friends I’ve made along the way feel like they were meant to be part of it.
Together, we’re creating unique traditions that make this Christmas feel different but just as meaningful.
Whether it’s enjoying a classic roast dinner, cracking Christmas crackers, or dancing to holiday carols, we’re finding our own special ways to celebrate.
Through this journey, I’ve discovered so much about myself and created memories I’ll carry with me long after the festive season ends.
It might not be the Christmas I grew up with, but it’s a Christmas that perfectly reflects where I am now, the people who’ve become part of my story, and how I feel in this moment—and that’s something truly special.
Hello!

Hello everyone, my name is Aaratrika, and I am a 2nd year student at Leeds Beckett University studying Sports Business Management and today I’m going to share my experience as an international student spending Christmas away from home, reflecting on my first year in Leeds as well as how I more or less plan on spending this year as well along with some recommendations in order to make your Christmas more joyful.
For someone like me who grew up in the vibrant chaos of Kolkata, Christmas has always been a festival of warmth, community, and endless cheer.
The streets of Park Street were illuminated with, as we often liked to joke about, ‘all the lights in the world’ and were often jam-packed with all the people who spend their Christmas Eve there, resulting in long queues outside the restaurants and streets filled with the loud and cheerful crowd.
Vendors and stalls line the streets just for the day along with the churches being illuminated with ethereal light cast by all the candles placed by the people.
Yet a year ago, life, some fairly good grades and an urge to start accomplishing my goals brought me to the much colder streets of Leeds where I celebrated my very first Christmas away from home.
Leeds with its brisk winter air and cosy atmosphere, has its own way of celebrating the festive season.
The city transforms into its own Christmas wonderland with sparkling decorations, a bustling Christmas market, and ice-skating rinks.
Yet, amidst all this, I couldn’t help but feel homesick.
The absence of family and the usual warmth (literally) made me realise that I am indeed thousands of kilometres away from home, although it also offered the opportunity to experience and embrace a new kind of Christmas.
It would be ridiculous to talk about Christmas in Leeds without mentioning the Christmas markets.
Undoubtedly a must-visit to anyone and everyone who’s new to Leeds or even UK in general, and it takes place across several towns and cities such as London, Leeds, York, etc.
The aroma of mulled wine, hot chocolate and the food stalls entices the people in, which leads to the revelation of not just food and drinks but also game stalls along with quite a few rides, some of which are not for the faint hearts, and all-time favourite recommendation of mine, the ice rink.
Such cheer and joyfulness across the city is enough to fill anyone’s heart with warmth and bound to make people feel the festive spirit.
Another must visit would the Trinity and the Corn Exchange shopping, being perhaps the most popular shopping centres in Leeds.
Every festive season you would see the centres illuminated with Christmas decorations along with several stores running a number of sales (if any of you are into festive shopping as much as me) on clothes, shoes, home products, etc.
For anyone who’s new to Leeds, the Trinity Kitchen especially is something I would consider a ‘heaven’ for all the foodies.
For this year, I have already visited the Christmas markets of both Leeds and York, York being a historical city I would recommend absolutely everyone as the whole city twinkles with the festive lights, along with a must visit Christmas market with a delicious range of food and drinks and just so many fun things to do whether you’re going solo or with friends.
Further on I plan on visiting the church with a friend and for the very first time I would be experiencing the much heard of Christmas carols as I quote my friend “It’s bound to make anyone feel in the spirit”.
Admittedly I don’t have a lot of plans yet for this Christmas but I have always been someone who makes plans at the very last minute so fingers crossed that this festive season would be even better than last year’s.
While I do miss Kolkata’s bustling streets along with the brightly lit Park Street, somehow since last September Leeds has become what we call ‘home away from home’ for me.
This city has taught me a life-long lesson in adaptability and gratitude.
Whilst it isn’t and would never be the same as celebrating at home, it is no less special.
It introduced me to many new cultures and traditions as I celebrate with my friends, allowing me to blend some of my own traditions along with experiencing something new but equally exciting.
So, for anyone spending Christmas away from home, my advice would be to get out of your comfort zone and start exploring.
The city of Leeds is filled with a lot of hidden gems anyways so whether you plan your holidays beforehand or on the spot, these small recommendations that I have given above would be some nice places to start or even a stroll along the cheerful streets of City Square or the quietness of Headingley, its bound to make you feel the warmth of the joyous season despite the absolutely freezing temperature according to me.

In advance a very Merry Christmas to everyone and a Happy New Year.

Hi, my name is Will, I am a first year student studying Politics at Leeds Beckett – I have wrote this blog to shed some of my wisdom on saving money at university when wanting to eat out.
Leeds has a fruitful variety of food options and for me, is one of the great attractions of living in the city.
Going for a meal is a great way to make friends , new connections and create lasting memories.
This of course can be a little more difficult at university while we’re managing our money, but there are plenty of ways to still enjoy all the food which the city has to offer .
These are my favourite deals and tips to finding the best value for your money in Leeds.
The first tip I’ll give you, is finding a good deal is much easier at lunchtime than dinner.
There are lots of places that do lunch time discounts, especially for students.
- Leeds has a huge selection of Thai restaurants – from 12 to 5 everyday , Thai A Roy Dee does a set menu for £9.95.
This includes all the Thai staples, C hicken S atay, G reen or R ed curry and Pad Thai as well as Veggie options too.
- There is a similar deal at Mommy Thai , a three-course set menu for under ten pounds.
- If you are seeking something simpler but equally as delicious, Pieminister offer their express lunch – a side, a pie and gravy for £7.50.
Pieminister also offers a reward scheme if you download their app, so make the most out of your visit and get rewarded for the habit !
- I Am Doner offers a five-pound kebab at lunch time – they are not your ordinary night out kebabs but really high quality & non-greasy which you don’t feel bad about eating.
Like Pieminister , they are no nonsense easy and quick choice which I would highly recommend.
There are similar deals all around Leeds, I would suggest having a walk around and find ing somewhere you like the look of.
This really helps getting acclimatised to the city and finding your own little spo t .
This is what I did for my first month living in Leeds - I accidentally spent all of my summer savings finding affordable food with new friends.
Food is a personal choice, so just go for a walk and see where you end up.
A common scheme restaurants run is themed day s .
For Wing Wednesday, you really have a great choice –
- The Dry Dock offers 40p a wing.
I’m no maths expert but that’s 10 wings for £4 !
- The same company owns Hyde Park Club and runs the same deal; there’s also a cauliflower option which is arguably better .
- Cult Wing do half price wings on Wednesday, their wings are top tier, and the décor is pretty cool too – they also do 50% off on Taco Tuesday….
and Thursday !
All three places are in walking distan ce of Leeds Beckett City campus which is your Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday sorted.
Whatever your restaurant of choice - I recommend that you look into whether they have a loyalty app – if they do, definitely use it !
Scanning your app with each order & receiving notifications about special offers & deals you will get the most value for your money.
Download all the delivery apps and wait for them to offer you deals.
Uber Eats regularly offers 40% and 50% percent off with a minimum spend so if you are with a group having a movie night it becomes very worth it.
I would also always order from independent places when ordering online as you cannot scan your reward cards from the big dogs through the delivery apps.
Beckett also provides fantastic deals that I highly recommend taking advantage of, given their convenience.
The £2 meal option is a real steal, allowing you to get the most out of your money.
I once indulged in sausage, mash, and gravy at 10 o'clock in the morning, which felt unconventional but turned out to be surprisingly satisfying.
They also offer a reward scheme with various benefits , including a free slice of cake on your birthday, making your special day even sweeter.
Additionally, Beckett is committed to sustainability and waste reduction, which not only benefits your wallet but also the environment.
Leeds offers a dynamic food scene that's always evolving, making it an exciting place to explore - i t is the foodie capital of the north in my opinion .
Do your research, always google discount codes, go on TikTok and Instagram for where to eat well for cheap, speak to people about where they like.
Food is fun , social and allows you to explor e Leeds to find where you fancy which is a fulfilling opportunity.
Hi, my name is Will, I am a first year student studying Politics at Leeds Beckett.

New sentences found on https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/blogs/student-blog-squad/2024/08/budgeting-101:
Hey , Abi here , a recent Leeds Beckett Events Management graduate.
Having completed (and survived!) four years of university, I want to tell you about some budgeting tips you can use as a student to help you manage your money at uni .
Let's jump straight into it : creating a budget is the first thing you want to do when planning your finances (the clue is in the name!).
You can set a budget for any time frame you need, but I typically had a weekly and monthly budget while keeping track of yearly income and expenses, including loans.
Since loans usually come in three instalments (to prevent you from spending it all at once), gather information about the amounts and timing of your loans.
Try to break it down into what you can spend weekly on your three biggest expenses: rent, bills, and food.
This will help you see what other income you need to bring in or how much you mig h t have left over.
And remember, you don't have to spend any extra money you have , think about saving it for future needs or special experiences—your future self will thank you!
Next, look at your guaranteed income.
Do you work a certain number of hours a week or have a side hustle that brings in an average income each month?
If so, include this in your budget.
If not, consider finding a job at a local cafe or bar.
Once you've sorted out your income and budget for the week, month, and year, you can start thinking about your expenses.
For many of you, this might be your first time living away from home so don’t expect to nail your expenses perfectly in the first few months.
Even if you're not living away from home while studying, you still need to track expenses.
While certain costs like gym memberships or Netflix accounts won’t change, other expenses might fluctuate a bit while you get into the groove of ‘adulting ’.
My best advice is to track what you know and then do as accurate a breakdown as possible for expenses like food, bills, going out, socialising, travel, or those new shoes you need because you lost one on the way back from a bar at 3 a.m.
(why is it never both?!).
Once you’ve tracked your expenses, you can compare them with your budget and see if you can splurge on an extra pizza that week or if you'll need a few more quiet nights in than you hoped.
Never shop while you're hungry
You’ll put more into your trolley when your hunger hormone, ghrelin, is telling your brain you’re starving (not to get too technical), and then you get home and realise you’ve spent £15 more on random stuff that, once you’re full, aren’t as appealing.
Don't underestimate the power of a shopping list
Instead of aimlessly walking around wondering what you fancy for tea for the next few nights, see what you have in the cupboards and make a rough meal plan for the week.
This way, you won’t buy random stuff and end up with a tin of sardines, some frozen peas, and beef jerky for dinner (I mean, it might slap hard as a meal, but it wouldn’t be my top pick).
Reduce takeaways
I had a rule that I was only allowed one takeaway a week, saving me about £30 weekly (assuming you spend just over a tenner ordering food three times a week).
That’s £120 a month …a new pair of Nikes !
As tempting as it is—especially since you still haven’t replaced that lost shoe— don't blow all your student loan at once.
Take the time to budget for the next few months and track your expenses before deciding how much to spend.
Some students find that their loan doesn’t cover their full rent, so keep in mind that you might not have anything extra to spend.
One of the most common financial pitfalls for students is confusing wants with needs.
For instance, that Starbucks Matcha Latte might feel like an absolute necessity after a late-night assessment submission, but what you really need is coffee.
You want the £5 coffee, but you could make it at home for at least £4 less and have enough for weeks.
Another issue is giving in to peer pressure so get comfortable setting boundaries .
It’s easier said than done in the moment, but if you don’t have enough in your entertainment budget for a night out, it’s okay to say no.
Your sensible financial decisions might even encourage your friends to make better choices too.
Sometimes, a cozy night in with a film , a £5 bottle of wine and leftovers is more enjoyable anyway.
Lastly, be aware of where your money is going.
Check your bank statements weekly and see what’s coming out.
Did you realise you’re paying for Student Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify?
Maybe you don’t need all of them.
Consider unsubscribing from one or sharing accounts with housemates.
For example, I have a family Spotify plan with my housemates, and it costs just £3.50 each per month .
- C reate a budget with what you know is coming in, then look at what is going out (remember what you NEED to pay for, and what would be nice).
- S ave money where you can ; shop in the reduced aisles in supermarkets – and remember your freezer draw er exist s!
- B e mindful that no one’s budget will be the same, be supportive if people say no, as you may need them to be supportive to you as well.
I hope these tips give you a solid starting point for managing your finances while at uni .
With a bit of planning and smart spending, you can enjoy your time without blowing your budget.

You can also chat to some of our current mature students to find out about their experience of studying at Leeds Beckett University.
Applying to university as a mature student Hear from our Schools and Colleges Outreach team and Student Ambassador Dan about applying as a mature student.
Around a third of undergraduate students at Leeds Beckett are classed as mature students - So if you're over the age of 21, you certainly won't be alone!
Mature Students are also entitled to Student Finance support.
You can apply for a Maintenance Loan for living costs and a Tuition Fee Loan to cover your course fees.
Mature students will often have similar worries and preconceptions about what university will be like for them.
These can sometimes be based on truth.
For example, it’s likely to be true that you'll need to budget your money more effectively than before, especially if you're going from full-time employment to full-time study.
However, there are plenty of preconceptions we hear which are simply not true and nothing to be worried about.
Take a look through this list to see which these are - we think you may find it reassuring.
Something we hear a lot is that mature students worry they'll be the only person on their course who's over 18 years of age.
While this may be true in a few (very rare) cases, it’s definitely the exception to the rule.
In fact, almost a third of Leeds Beckett’s student population is made up of mature students, meaning you’re likely to make friends of all ages on your course, regardless of which subject you choose.
In addition, we often hear that mature students are surprised at how well they get along with their younger course mates.
You’re all in the same boat after all - you have a shared love of a subject, you’re going through the same challenges and everybody is looking to make friends.
This is something we hear people worrying about a lot, but it is definitely not true.
People worry their age will mean that younger students on their course won't want to interact with them, which is simply not the case.
You’ll soon find that the only person worried about your age at university is you.
Don’t see yourself as a ‘mature’ student, simply a student, and make the most of all of the opportunities available to you in the same way that anybody else would.
There are many ways to make friends at Leeds Beckett.
Our course leaders provide plenty of opportunities for people to bond with their classmates.
Some courses host welcome parties, organise residential trips away or run intensive induction weeks.
Outside of your course, there are also plenty of opportunities to make friends, and it’s not all about big nights out (although there is room for that if that’s what you’re into!).
There’s Freshers Week, where Leeds Beckett’s SU hosts lots of activities – from tea parties, to club nights, to the Freshers Fair.
Then there’s our societies and teams, and we’re almost certain that there will be one to suit you.
If there isn’t, you can always form your own.
It’s inevitable that heading to university after a break in education will come with some challenges.
It’s a big change, but don’t worry – Leeds Beckett can offer you an array of support to help you to manage.
Here are just a few examples:
Study skills
If you’re worried that your study skills won’t be up to scratch after taking a break in education, Leeds Beckett has plenty of resources available to assist you.
Our library can help you build a variety of skills, such as digital literacy, academic communication, maths, statistical analysis and using IT.
Then there’s your course tutors.
They are dedicated to helping you succeed on your course and will be happy to help if you’re struggling with any skills.
Financial
Financing your studies can be a challenge for everybody, no matter what their personal situation.
As many mature students entering education have previously worked full time, it can be even more daunting to give that up and enter full time studies.
However, there are ways of ensuring you can manage your money effectively.
Firstly, you could get a part-time job alongside your course - it's a great way to earn some extra money and boost your CV along the way.
Lots of our students are able to find work to suit their schedule.
In addition, we have our Student Money team who can support you with budgeting, money management advice, and even advise on things such as scholarships and bursaries.
Juggling family life
We know that it can be difficult to fit in time for study when you have a family to take care of.
It’s really important that you have a strong support system around you to support your learning, and that includes at home and at university.
At home, you may need to let your friends and family aware of any big deadlines, so that you can plan childcare or any other responsibilities well in advance.
You don’t want to be panicking before a large exam!
At university, it’s vital that you inform your tutors of your family commitments from the beginning, so that if you ever do run into any difficulty juggling your commitments, they can help you.
It’s worth letting your new course mates know too.
If, for example, you were to miss lectures one day due to a family issue – it would be great to have people to share their notes with you.
It’s worth remembering that plenty of people do well while juggling many different responsibilities, and with the correct support around you, you can too.
Working
If you’re planning on studying alongside employment, we can support you with this too.
We have plenty of flexible study options, such as part-time degrees, flexible start dates, or distance learning.
In addition, in some circumstances professional qualifications or experience can count towards the degree – meaning you don’t have to cover the entirety of the course content.
Get in touch with our admissions team to learn more about any of these.
In addition, our course tutors are there for support during your studies.
If you know that you will be working alongside your studies, let your tutors know as early as possible.
There may be ways that they can help to support you to be successful.
When you join Leeds beckett, you'll be joining a diverse community including lots of other mature students.

Preparing for university is an exciting time but we also know that it requires lots of organisation and preparation before you make the move and start your studies.
That’s why we’ve put together some tips for arrival as well as an insight into moving day so that you know exactly what to do beforehand and what to expect when you get here.
Tips for your arrival
Complete online welcome
Before anything else, you need to ensure that you have completed your ‘Online Welcome’ .
This is a hub of super useful information, and it’s really important that you explore all of this site before you join us.
It contains information on things such as student finance, timetables, and you’ll be able to upload your photo for your student ID card.
Get social
If you don’t already, follow Leeds Beckett on social media.
We recommend following or liking our Facebook , X and Instagram , as we post different content on each.
You’ll see that we share lots of important information and reminders, as well as exciting things like events on campus and giveaways.
You'll also be invited to our community group on Unibuddy where you can get to know people before you arrive.
Get snug as a bug...
Well, plan for getting that university room snug we mean!
Print off pictures that are special to you and buy yourself some nice frames.
Why not also go shopping and grab lots of things to make your room homely, like fairy lights, cushions and posters?
Posters are always a conversation starter, as well as a simple and cheap item to add character to your new bedroom.
You might even have some random sentimental items hanging around the house that will remind you of good times, like that magnet you bought in Spain when you were little.
Make sure you put these things on your packing list too – no matter how random.
You’ll be amazed at how happy these memories can make you if you’re ever feeling a bit homesick.
Create a packing list
For a stress-free move to uni, do your packing as far in advance as possible.
It’s important that you make a list, to ensure that you don’t forget anything important, but also to ensure you’re not taking anything unnecessary.
Take a look at the what to bring page on our accommodation site, as it will tell you what is included already in your halls (and therefore what you don’t need to bring).
By creating your list nice and early, you’ll avoid any of the last-minute stress, and it gives you time to reflect on whether you really need to take that 15th pair of shoes.
It’s also a good idea to include these (often forgotten) items on your list:
If you do forget anything, there’s plenty of places to go and grab a replacement here in Leeds.
Heading out on a shopping trip with your flatmates in your first week is actually a great way to break the ice and explore the city.
Think about transport
Our advice is to leave your car at home.
You won't need a car to make the most of your student experience in Leeds and, due to City Council regulations, parking around campus is very limited.
Before you arrive, it's a good idea to plan your journey to and from university each day, and work out whether it's a good idea to buy a travel pass.
You could also consider a bike - you can hire one from us with a £50 deposit, £50 for the first three months, and £15 for every three months after that.
A D-lock and lights are included.
We've also provided tyre pumps and secure cycle storage on each campus.
Additionally, we offer full workshops with trained staff to help you with bike maintenance and repairs .
Food, glorious food
Something which parents often worry about is that their children will live off a diet of instant noodles and cereal when they’re at university.
Well, why not settle your parents’ nerves before you arrive by topping up one of our campus food cards ?
That way, they can be sure that you’ll always be able to afford a delicious and nutritious meal from one of our many campus food outlets.
Check out what support is available to you
Our Wellbeing team is a team of professionals who can help you should you ever feel the need for support.
It's worth taking a look at what support is available to you once you arrive here, just in case you may ever need it.
If you have a long term health condition, such as diabetes, epilepsy, or a mental health condition such as anxiety or depression; a specific learning difficulty, such as dyslexia; or a physical disability, such a hearing or visual impairment you can speak to our Disability Advice team .
Supporting our students is really important to us, and the earlier you make contact the better so we can try to get tailored support ready for when you arrive.
Take a look at your work
Okay, we know that this one sounds a little bit nerdy.
It is, however, always a good idea to take a look at what modules you’ll be studying, and get an overview of what you’ll be learning.
By knowing in advance what will come up in your first few lectures, you’ll feel way more calm and prepared.
You may even want to purchase some textbooks and begin to skim through them.
We don’t advise buying too many textbooks though – usually, only the core one for each module is necessary to buy.
Spend time with family and friends
Now, here’s a nice task for you.
It’s always a great idea to cram in plenty of quality time with your nearest and dearest before you head off to university.
We’re sure that when you do arrive, your diary will be jam packed and you may not get home as often as you like.
And finally….
Get excited!
You’re about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime, and we’re sure you’re going to love it.
Moving to a university is an exciting time with lots of new experiences ahead.
You may be wondering how and where you will make friends and whether you will settle in.
Our students have been in your position and want to assure you that you will make friends and have put together some tips for settling in.
It might seem like a huge and daunting task, packing your life up and moving - but i promise it's not.
Give yourself plenty of time to pack, and I would recommend making a tick list of everything you want to bring (because there will always be something you’ll forget!).

Hi, I'm Toby, a Journalism student and I've just wrapped up my second year at Leeds Beckett.
This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to spend two weeks on the east coast of China, an experience that was truly unforgettable.
Now that I'm back in the UK and feeling that strange post-travel slump, I've had time to reflect on the journey and everything it gave me.
From eye-opening moments to cultural discoveries, I'm excited to share just how special this trip was.
From the moment we landed in China, the reality hit far quicker than I expected: I was actually there.
I've never been anywhere so different from the UK and I absolutely loved it.
After surviving a 13-hour flight, we kicked things off with two packed days in Shanghai.
A global powerhouse in economics and technology, Shanghai felt like stepping into the future.
As busy and buzzing as London, but with its own distinct energy, it is a city full of life and has endless places to explore.
On our first day, we crammed in a trip up the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower, a ferry ride down the Huangpu River, shopping along the neon-lit Nanjing Road, and the city's famous light show.
No time wasted.
“My favourite part was the furniture company visit.
Asking for a business card, and the chance to visit again as an intern really gave me a great opportunity.” - Imran, Accounting and Finance
Next, we travelled to Hangzhou, home to Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT).
While smaller than Shanghai, Hangzhou is still much larger than Leeds and had just as much to offer.
We visited temples, sat in on university lectures, toured local businesses, wandered through night markets and theme parks, and, of course, ate out a lot.
Every single day was packed.
Picking a single favourite moment is nearly impossible, every day left me exhausted in the best way.
If I had to mention something that took a bit of getting used to, it would be the attention we attracted.
Being asked for photos by the local people or occasionally filmed without asking was a surreal experience.
While it was mostly done politely and out of curiosity, it definitely gave me a small glimpse into what life might be like for someone famous.
Let's just say, it made me appreciate the quiet moments even more!
One highlight that stands out was visiting a Buddhist temple in Hangzhou.
Photography wasn't allowed inside, which made being fully present even more rewarding.
The towering 20-foot statues and intricate architecture were breathtaking, and watching locals quietly practicing their faith was especially moving - made even more powerful by the contrast to the high-energy modern city we'd just left behind.
I also really enjoyed putting my limited Mandarin to the test.
Even though I butchered plenty of it, the locals always appreciated the effort, and those little interactions made the experience more memorable.
“I loved visiting Shanghai at night, it was an experience that’s hard to forget.
The views were beautiful and this was the moment where it hit that I was really in China.
It’s definitely benefited my career, it got me out of my comfort zone which will help me in the consultant role I’m in now.” Ruqqaya, Business Management with Law graduate
As a Journalism student, I'll admit I was initially unsure how much I'd take away from the academic sessions and company visits, where we covered topics like economy and trade which are outside my usual comfort zone.
But to my surprise, the lectures were really engaging and clearly delivered.
They gave me a fascinating glimpse into what it might be like to study economics at university level.
The content was thorough, and I particularly enjoyed hearing perspectives on emerging technologies and international trade with the West especially through a distinctly Chinese lens.
One of the more thought-provoking parts of the trip was learning about China's media landscape.
I discovered that all national media is state-owned, and while independent journalism is permitted, it must not challenge the government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
CCTV (Chinese Central Television), the country's largest broadcaster, was a frequent presence - from TVs in public spaces to office buildings we passed in Hangzhou.
As someone studying Journalism, this naturally made me reflect on media freedom and the influence it can have on public perception.
Initially, I found myself quick to question the limitations, but the more I thought about it, the more I realised media ownership elsewhere isn't necessarily immune from bias either.
In the UK, for example, around 90% of national newspaper circulation is controlled by just three companies, a reminder that media concentration is a global issue.
On a completely different note, one of the most impressive aspects of the trip was witnessing China's technological advancements.
From electric vehicles dominating the roads to robots delivering food in hotels and restaurants, it felt like the future had already arrived.
But perhaps what left the biggest impression was the kindness of the people.
Whether it was giving directions or helping with translation apps, everyone we met was warm and welcoming.
For a country that's not typically seen as a major tourist destination, I never once felt out of place.
“Learning directly from experts and seeing how China, as a global economic powerhouse, navigates trade policy has really sharpened my commercial awareness.
It’s also helped me think more strategically and globally, which I know will be so valuable when advising future clients in a consulting role.” - Sue Jean, Masters in Public Relations and Strategic Communications
One of the key differences I noticed about workplaces in China is that remote working is still quite uncommon even in roles where it could be possible.
Since COVID, many employees in the UK have continued working from home, with businesses benefiting from reduced overheads like office space, electricity, and heating.
In contrast, I saw huge office buildings in China filled with rows of employees, each working quietly at their own laptops.
The atmosphere was often silent and focused.
It's not that workforces elsewhere are less dedicated, but there was a noticeable sense of discipline and concentration among Chinese workers, something I found inspiring and hope to bring into my own approach to work.
This trip really opened my eyes to careers in economics and business - areas I didn't fully understand before.
While I won't be switching courses with only one year left of my Journalism degree, it's given me a new appreciation for the depth of study and effort that goes into understanding markets and consumer behaviour.
I think experiences like this are incredibly valuable for students.
They offer the chance to gain new skills, fresh perspectives, and even potential work experience, all of which are essential for standing out as a graduate.
“Since my first year at Leeds Beckett I vowed to make the most of every opportunity given to me, and so far I’ve successfully managed to experience many international study opportunities through the Uni.
I think employers will really appreciate my cultural awareness and drive to put myself out of my comfort zone.”  - Zulekha, International Business
The summer school trip to China is an incredible opportunity particularly for economics and business students.
Attending lectures at Zhejiang University of Technology allows students to deepen their understanding and expand on what they’ve learned in class.
It's especially valuable for gaining a fresh perspective on global finance and international trade, in a country that has undergone rapid and remarkable economic transformation since the mid-20th century.
The company visits were another highlight, offering a first-hand look at how businesses operate in China, as well as the chance to build connections and potentially explore future internship opportunities.
That said, the trip is by no means limited to business students.
Beyond the academic element, there’s a strong focus on cultural exploration.
You'll visit temples, markets, and key landmarks, and even get some free time to make your own plans (we were still up at 6am most days to make the most of it!).
Getting into China does involve a bit of preparation, including visa applications and letters of invitation, but travelling as part of a university group helps streamline much of the bureaucracy.
China is a world apart from the UK in many ways, and the trip offers countless cultural insights that stay with you long after you return.
It's a genuinely eye-opening experience that can shape how you think, work, and engage with the world.
