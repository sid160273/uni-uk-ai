For more information about the REF, visit their website .
The generic REF criteria for assessing outputs are originality, significance and rigour:
The criteria for assessing the quality of outputs are ‘originality, significance and rigour.
Four Star - Quality that is world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour.
Three Sta r - Quality that is internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour, but which falls short of the highest standards of excellence.
Two Star - Quality that is recognised as internationally in terms of originality, significance and rigour.
One Star - Quality that is recognised nationally in terms of originality, significance and rigour.
Unclassified - Quality that falls below the standard of nationally recognised work, Or work which does not meet the published definition of research for the purposes of the REF assessment.
At Aston we have added a further level of granularity to our review process.
We are working to a 12-point scale in order to ensure that we have the best possible understanding of the rank order of the quality of papers for selection for the REF
Peer Review at Aston
Peer-review of outputs is conducted on an annual cycle to cover new outputs by existing staff since the last review as well as eligible outputs by new staff who have joined since the last review.
The review process involves four stages:
The following Principles will be observed:
All peer-reviewers will undertake the Aston University Equality and Diversity training awareness training for data users and will in addition, receive calibration training.
Only academics who have undertaken the training may conduct peer review.
The training should be refreshed triennially (unless otherwise advised).
The Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 has rated 79% of Aston University research as ‘world leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*).
In addition, 74% of the impact of the University’s research has been rated “very considerable” or “outstanding” for reach and significance.
The number of Aston University staff being submitted for assessment has doubled since the last REF in 2014 and, over the same period, the University has increased the proportion of its highest rated 4* publications from 21% in 2014 to 29% in 2021.
Aston University made a 100% submission of eligible staff across seven REF assessment units and has more than doubled its ‘research power’ since 2014.
Research power is calculated by the overall quality of the submission (the 'grade point average') multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted.

Bringing together the worlds of business and academia
Knowledge Exchange (KE) brings together the worlds of business and academia in a way that increases engagement and allows everyone to benefit from the power of new ideas.
Enterprise activities and KE are embedded in our culture and integral to everything we do.
Our outward-looking approach puts the needs of the regional economy and our student body first.
We aim to deliver economic growth, productivity enhancement and social impact through five key themes:
Tackling the social and economic challenges of today hinges upon the effective exchange of knowledge and specialist expertise between a wide range of institutions and people.
Our research strategy focuses on four University Research Institutes and the expansion of our interdisciplinary research centres.
All are regional, national, and international leaders in their respective fields, and their exceptional work is having a significant impact on industry, the public sector and individuals.
Our work in Knowledge Exchange informs and influences policy to foster a culture of evidence-based policymaking.
This process takes many forms, including providing advice to government, organising policy briefings in areas such as bioenergy and ethnic minority entrepreneurship, and using our research and influence to improve policymaking practices internationally.

Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP) are one of the most efficient and effective tools available to businesses who want to drive up competitiveness and productivity.
By giving them the opportunity to partner with some of the UK’s leading experts, these knowledge-based partnerships allow companies to draw on the latest academic thinking and leverage it to deliver innovative and strategically important business projects.
Our long and rich research heritage has made us one of the UK’s most active and successful institutions for KTP, boasting the most extensive portfolio in the West Midlands and ranking 8th in the UK overall.
Aston University’s research footprint and the impact it leaves on industry is growing year on year, with businesses that engage in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships benefitting from an average 1107% return on investment from their initial grants.
In September 2020, Aston’s excellence was recognised by Innovate UK at their national ‘Best of the Best’ KTP Awards.
Here is a small sample of our projects:
Increasing numbers of businesses and institutions are beginning to grasp the transformative and competitive advantages that research can offer.

Our track record of research exploitation dates back over 40 years, with one of our earliest and most renowned success stories being the revolutionary anti-cancer medication, Temozolomide .
This blockbuster drug became the treatment of choice for some of the most hard-to-treat brain cancers and achieved annual worldwide sales of over $1bn.
Research England praised our IP and commercialisation efforts in the 2021 Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF), placing us in the top 30 per cent of comparable institutions for intellectual property (IP) and commercialisation.
However, the process of producing new research never ends, and new frontiers of research are opening up all the time.
To stay at the forefront of research, we offer an in-house team of KE experts and are active members of both Midlands Innovation and the MICRA gateway—a partnership between eight research-oriented universities in the Midlands.
We share best practices and combine resources with other Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) across the UK.
Membership of these organisations also empowers our business partners with rapid access to Intellectual Property Case Managers and the expertise they offer.
The MICRA gateway provides a powerful and practical all-in-one point of contact for industry, as well as a means of showcasing the region’s remarkable history of IP offerings.
The result is a versatile ecosystem where industry receives access to the tools and people they need, and research excels hand-in-hand with commerce.
Equipped with the right knowledge and know-how, businesses are free to enjoy the full benefits of shared research while capitalising on the West Midlands’ industrial strengths.
Highlights of our work include:
Public engagement is a vital part of effective Knowledge Exchange , and we make sure to involve the public at every possible stage.
We approach individuals and communities to encourage participation in planning new research, inviting them to contribute to science and even co-produce projects where possible.
Sharing the impact that our research has on the everyday lives of people is a vital part of what makes research at Aston stand out from the crowd, and we do this through digital events, case studies, face-to-face talks, seminars, roadshows and much more.
Public engagement can take many different forms, including:
Valuable partnerships with stakeholders like Citizens UK also provide us with a direct means of engaging with the public, including the diverse communities of Birmingham and the West Midlands.
Few projects highlight the power of public engagement and Knowledge Exchange better than Aston Villa’s promotion of eye health in the form of Aston Vision .

Together they worked with the Aston Villa Foundation , Citizens UK, and their community anchor partners to hold a series of well-attended community listening events.
With the Premier League and the PFA’s backing, Aston Villa’s optometrist received support from our students and access to equipment provided by Essilor.
Together they delivered workshops and eye tests to the local community and local schools.
Meaningful public engagement like this acts as a powerful tool, both for raising awareness around the importance of research and improving healthcare accessibility.

To remain at the forefront of Knowledge Exchange nationally and internationally, we are continuously monitoring and benchmarking our progress against competitors.
Not only do frameworks such as REF and KEF help us demonstrate our successful track record to potential collaborators and partners, they also help to underpin a culture of excellence and best practice.
Aston is a signatory of the national Knowledge Exchange Concordat – an agreement that will encourage the sharing and implementation of best practice sector-wide.
The Government is committed to a strategic, long-term approach to Knowledge Exchange.
In return, it expects universities to demonstrate the value of what they do while pursuing excellence and sharing good practice.
The Knowledge Exchange Concordat has been introduced to ensure that universities and other providers of higher education and research work effectively; not only with each other, but with businesses and other organisations.
In December 2019, our Vice-Chancellor committed Aston to the Concordat.
This places us amongst the first cohort of UK universities to become signatories, and demonstrates the significance of Knowledge Exchange in delivering on our commitment to continuous improvement.
Signatories will be expected to:
In addition to the above, those who sign up to the development year are expected to:
We are committed to undertaking research that makes a tangible difference to the economy and broader society.
The role of measuring that performance falls to the Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF).
The Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF), led by Research England, is a sector-wide, institutional-level exercise to inform and assess KE activities of UK higher education institutions and how they benefit society and the economy.
The KEF aims to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public funding for KE and to further a culture of continuous improvement in universities.
It allows universities to better understand and improve their own performance and provide businesses and other users with more information to help them access world-class knowledge and expertise.
Working with business and supporting local growth and regeneration
Compared to other universities with a similar profile in the exercise, Aston University is in the top 20 per cent for working with business and supporting local growth and regeneration.
This draws directly from Aston University's strengths in collaborative research and its focus on providing consultancy solutions to industry problems.
It also reflects its work through the government's flagship Knowledge Transfer Partnership programme, in which it is an acknowledged sector leader.
Aston University's high performance for local growth and regeneration is a result of its investment in delivering business support programme to SMEs and, more recently, helping them adapt and thrive during and after COVID-19 in areas such as advanced materials, data analytics and small business leadership development.
Intellectual property (IP)
Aston University also performed well in the intellectual property (IP) and commercialisation category, being placed in the top 30 per cent of comparable institutions.
REF is the UK’s system for assessing the quality of research publications, the impact of said research, and the research environment in UK higher education institutions.
Measuring impact is a central pillar of REF, and in 2014 we ranked in the top 20 of UK universities for 3* and 4* rated impact.
This puts us ahead of Birmingham, Warwick and many other competitors in the higher education sector.
Submissions will be made to REF 2021 in the coming months and Aston’s submission will include 36 new Impact Case Studies drawn from across the University.
The Research and Enterprise department is responsible for the University’s strategy around impactful, collaborative, excellent and sustainable research.

Through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP), the three-year project will involve specialist expertise in data science and AI to create new technologies for Harper James.
The law firm, which specialises in supporting SMEs, will use the system to enable its commercial lawyers to speed up work by automating processes like project scoping, proposals contracting and client onboarding.
The project will apply and extend the latest research on GenAI to develop novel AI models to analyse and learn from legal services data.
The intelligent platform will be capable of tracking and learning from past cases to assist with forecasting the range of outcomes and potential legal procedures involved in future projects.
Harper James aims to differentiate itself in the UK legal sector through the way it delivers legal services and its subscription model.
To further enhance its services, deliver more value to clients and maximise internal efficiencies, the firm is transitioning from a traditional billable-hour pricing model to a new value-based pricing model.
With an AI-enabled legal services platform, the KTP will create efficiencies that allow this transition, supporting the law firm to adapt and grow in a rapidly evolving sector.
Toby Harper, founder and CEO of Harper James, said: “The innovation developed through this project with Aston University is a fundamental pillar that will set us apart from the rest of the legal services sector.
It will allow our lawyers to focus on delivering exceptional value to clients, who will receive advice and support faster, more efficiently, and with even greater pricing transparency.
Professor Abdul Sadka, director of The Sir Peter Rigby Digital Futures Institute at Aston University, said:
“KTPs like this form a very important part of our contribution to society as academics.
By working in partnership, we can extend our specialist knowledge and expertise while being a solution provider to ambitious businesses like Harper James, enabling them to overcome digital challenges faced along their growth and innovation journeys.”
Developing this level of innovation will draw on the research team’s expertise in the latest AI technologies, including natural language processing, federated learning and predictive analytics.
The project brings together Aston University experts from across two of its academic centres, The Sir Peter Rigby Digital Futures Institute and the Aston Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Application.
Established at the intersection between engineering, health and social sciences, The Sir Peter Rigby Digital Futures Institute’s goal is to advance digital transformation through collaborative projects that deliver economic and social benefits for Birmingham, the West Midlands and beyond.
Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, funded by Innovate UK, are collaborations between a business, a university and a highly qualified research associate.
The UK-wide programme helps businesses to improve their competitiveness and productivity through the better use of knowledge, technology and skills.
Aston University is a sector-leading KTP provider, ranked first for project quality, and joint first for the volume of active projects.

Aston University researchers’ recommendations to boost the UK's ethnic minority businesses are to be adopted by the government.
The Department for Business and Trade has announced it will be using proposals made in the Time to Change report which was produced by the University’s Centre for Research in Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship (CREME) and NatWest Group.
The report identifies key barriers faced by these businesses including access to finance, markets, and professional support.
The researchers have calculated that if these problems are addressed the UK economy would be boosted by an additional £75 billion Gross Value Added or GVA – the economic measure representing the value of goods and services produced by any economic unit, industry, or region.
It highlights 10 evidence-based recommendations to drive inclusion in policy, finance and business support.
CREME’s research which provided the evidence was supported by investment and collaboration from NatWest.
The study, which was published in 2022, will be incorporated in ‘Backing your business’, the government’s new plan for small and medium-sized businesses which sets out the long-term direction support for smaller firms.
Improvements will include a business growth service designed with ethnic minority businesses in mind and involving trusted community organisations in decisions.
Professor of small business at Aston Business School and director of CREME, Monder Ram OBE, said: “We’re delighted that the Department for Business and Trade has committed to being an implementation partner for the time to change report and will be working alongside us to embed its recommendations within the department and across the wider business support ecosystem.
“The UK government’s new Backing your business strategy represents a pivotal moment in the inclusive entrepreneurship agenda in this country.
Our recommendations - backed by rigorous research - are now formally embedded within national policy, signalling a shift from advocacy to commitment.” The government will be running a series of regional SME summits and roadshows to allow ethnic minority businesses to give their opinions and feedback to help shape its strategies.
Professor Ram added: “At CREME our mission is to translate research into policy and practice.
For years we have advocated that inclusive entrepreneurship requires systemic integration, not retrofitting.
This strategy - including the Department for Business and Trade becoming an official implementation partner - marks just that kind of structural turn.”

What is a ‘Simulated Patient’?
‘Simulated patients’ are people who assist with the development, training and assessment of our medical students.
They will play the role of 'real' patients, giving our students the opportunity to demonstrate their clinical skills as part of the assessments that are required throughout our MBChB programme.
Simulated patients play a key role in the assessment of our students’ clinical skills.
Here you will be given a 'brief' and be asked to play the part of a patient in a role-play scenario.
A student will then carry out a consultation with you, either with the aim of making a diagnosis or by practising a particular aspect of their communication skills, for example, empathy or breaking bad news.
You will also have the opportunity to give feedback to our students, helping them to become skilled, empathetic doctors.
Simulated patients will help to train the next generation of doctors for the NHS, many of whom will work in the local area.
We hope you will enjoy the opportunity to meet with other Simulated Patients and our medical students.
We expect that this will be a sociable and rewarding experience.
It may also help to enhance your CV if you are applying for other roles in the future.
‘Simulated patients’ will be employed on a casual worker basis (which is a 'zero hours contract') and paid at a rate of £22 per hour.
Please note that you will not be able to undertake this work on a self-employed basis.
We are keen that our simulated patients' reflect the rich diversity of our local community.
There is a minimum age of 18 years, but otherwise, we would like to hear from all interested parties irrespective of ethnicity, level of education, age or previous employment.
Previous acting experience is not mandatory though this may be an advantage.
Either way, simulated patients should be able to demonstrate the following:

Assessments will normally last for a whole day, and you would therefore need to work between the hours of approximately 8.30 am until 5 pm (exact times to be confirmed).
Yes, you will be invited to an initial induction session that will introduce you to Aston Medical School and give you further information about the ‘simulated patient' role.
We will also give you the opportunity to practise several role-play scenarios and receive feedback on these before working with the students.

Expert patients are those who have been affected by a significant medical condition and are willing to share their experience of this with our students.
We would like to hear from anyone who feels able to describe and discuss a significant health problem that has impacted on their quality of life.
However, we would be particularly interested to involve people who have experienced any of the following conditions:
Why are they needed?
It is important for our students to gain insight into the experience of living with some of the medical conditions that they have studied from a scientific perspective.
We hope that this will enable them to offer improved care to patients in the future.
Participants will be invited to describe their experience of illness through an interview with a member of our medical team: this will be observed by our students.
The possible topics to be covered will be discussed with you beforehand to ensure that you are comfortable with them.
We would not expect this to include any sensitive or personal matters.
The interview will last for between 30-45 minutes and will include time for the students to ask any questions that they may have.
Expert patients should be at least 18 years old but there is no upper age limit.
No previous experience of medical education is required but you will need to be comfortable with discussing your own health.
We hope that being an expert patient will prove to be an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
You will also have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped to train the future generation of doctors and have raised awareness about your own medical condition, with the aim of improving care for others going forward.

Aston Medical School welcomed its first students in September 2018.
Since 2019 we have been awarded government funding for 100 UK students and we have a target of 20-30 international students per year.
When do students have clinical placements in Primary care?
Aston Medical School has a strong focus on primary care.
Why should I be motivated to teach medical students?
We have a wonderful opportunity to promote Primary Care and re-balance the workforce crisis we face, and Aston Medical School is directly addressing this.

What does the Year 1 placement entail?
The placement is an observational placement, and there are no tutorials to deliver.
Students spend time with the breadth of the Primary Care team, including both healthcare and administrative colleagues.
The aims of the placement include gaining an appreciation of the delivery of NHS services, developing their consultation skills, appreciating the holistic assessment and management of patients, and developing their professional identity.
Students are allocated to placement in at least pairs (and in larger numbers depending on the size of the surgery).
The placement week is Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm (except Wednesday afternoons when the students are back at the University for their sports/ societies afternoon).
The GP Educator is overall responsible for the coordination of the placement, and providing individualised structured placement at the end of the week.
Core activities of the placement week include:
In addition to the core activities, the GP Educator also coordinates the timetabling of supplementary activities, depending on the services delivered at the GP surgery:
The timetable for the second week in June can be replicated, and to include additional supplementary experiences wherever possible.
The students are able to integrate additional knowledge and skills they have accrued over the Year-1 teaching at the medical school into their learning, during the second placement week.
I have no previous teaching experience – can i still get involved?
Absolutely, Aston Medical School will support you with training to establish your site as an undergraduate teaching practice.
Are there any additional commitments required of the GP Educator?
What are the requirements for the site to be eligible for Year 1 placements?

Aston University does not use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in cases involving harassment or sexual misconduct.
The University celebrates the rights of freedom of speech and academic freedom and is committed to protecting and upholding these rights within the law.
These rights are a fundamental consideration when we take action to deal with and prevent harassment and sexual misconduct at Aston.
‘Freedom of speech’ means everyone has the right to express lawful views and opinions freely, in speech or in writing, without interference.
‘Academic freedom’ means protecting the intellectual independence of academics to question and test received views and wisdom, and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions, without placing themselves in danger of losing their jobs or privileges or reducing the likelihood of them securing promotion or different roles at the University.
Aston affords a very high level of protection for the lawful expression of a viewpoint and for speech in an academic context, including protection for speech which is shocking, disturbing or offensive.
However, the University also has a duty to maintain safety and good order on its premises and harassment of any kind, including sexual misconduct, is never acceptable.
Therefore, whilst the University stands for the widest possible definition of free speech, unlawful speech or behaviour will not be tolerated.
For more information on what Freedom of Speech means at Aston, please visit our Freedom of Speech page .

Considering recent events, particularly the conflict in Israel, Gaza, and West Bank, we reaffirm our solidarity with those calling for a ceasefire, an end to violence, and the pursuit of dialogue as the pathway to lasting peace.
In collaboration with Aston Students' Union, we will plant a Peace Tree on our Birmingham campus as a symbol of our enduring hope for peace and our commitment to honouring all those affected by conflicts worldwide.
This tree represents our collective dedication to nurturing a future where peace, understanding, and sustainability are guiding principles for all.
Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by these conflicts.
Together, we remain hopeful for a future in which peace prevails, and we pledge to continue fostering a community where inclusion, compassion and understanding thrive.
Aston University is committed to providing an inclusive, caring and empowering environment for every member of our community, seeking to ensure that diversity of beliefs and opinions can be expressed freely and openly within the law.
We continue to be profoundly saddened by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the suffering and loss of life caused by the war in Gaza and Israel.
However, whilst we understand the strength of feeling that this terrible conflict has generated, we do not consider it appropriate for the University to express an institutional position regarding this conflict.
Our founding Charter provides that the University exists to “advance, disseminate and apply learning and knowledge by teaching and research.” Our main objective therefore is to provide all our students with excellent education in their chosen disciplines or professions within a safe, inclusive and supportive campus environment, and to enable them to excel, leading to successful employment and career progression.
The University’s fundamental purpose rests on our steadfast commitment to academic freedom and freedom of speech which must manifest itself by providing an environment in which all members of the University community feel encouraged and supported to express and explore all views and beliefs that are within the law.
It would be inconsistent with our mission and purpose to make public statements and take a position on matters that are extraneous to the University and which may serve to impede academic freedom and open discourse of subjects upon which there are divergent views.
We have, and will continue to foster, an environment that promotes intellectual challenge and disagreement in an inclusive and respectful manner, and within the law.
Our position does not limit members of the Aston University community from expressing lawful opinions on matters of political contention, but it does limit the position that the University takes on the conflict or indeed on other global political disputes.
In response to an Aston University Students’ Union Council emergency motion calling for the University to show solidarity with Palestinian students, the Vice-Chancellor and members of the University executive team met with the Students’ Union president, student representatives from various groups and societies and Students’ Union officials to better understand the key issues, student needs and requirements, clarify the University’s position and reinforce its commitment to all our students.
Importantly, we wish to acknowledge the specific issues and difficulties our students of Palestinian and Israeli background have been experiencing during the Israel-Gaza conflict and the impact this is having on their lives.
We are absolutely committed to supporting them at this difficult time to the best of our ability within the remit and resources of the University.
Our priority is to enable our students to continue their studies uninterrupted and to support their wellbeing, while ensuring that our campus remains a safe and welcoming place for all.
Throughout this period, we have actively reached out to all students and particularly those that may have been impacted by the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Our student welfare teams have met with students who are from these backgrounds to understand how we can support them during this difficult time.
We have also supported other students with their wellbeing who might be impacted by this conflict due to their heritage, cultural lineage or on humanitarian grounds.
The wellbeing of our community remains our top priority and our team will make every effort to provide care and support where we are able to do so.
Aston University offers many wellbeing services including counselling, mental health support and our chaplaincy team , who provide a listening ear for students of all faiths and none.
We will continue to work with our Students’ Union, student societies, students of both Israeli and Palestinian origin and all other impacted students to ensure they are able to continue their studies uninterrupted and to support them through this difficult time.
The Vice Chancellor’s executive is maintaining active oversight of the situation with all working groups and support teams providing regular reports to the Vice-Chancellor.
Specifically, we have:
Inclusion is a core value of Aston University and central to our 2030 strategy.
Our work in this field has resulted in multiple equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) charter awards (Race Equality Charter Bronze Award in 2022 and Athena Swan Gold award in 2023).
In 2022 we were awarded University of Sanctuary Status, joining a select network of higher education institutions across the UK working to develop support for those displaced by humanitarian crises, and we have launched a range of scholarships for this purpose.
We are doing all we can to embed and promote EDI at Aston University as our core value and prevent hate crime, antisemitism, Islamophobia and intolerance.
Anyone who has experienced bullying, harassment, discrimination, hate crime or assault should use our Report + Support tool, either with their identity or anonymously.
We have dedicated teams under the Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic and Chief People Officer who systematically deal with information we receive through this tool.
Aston University has no direct investments in Israeli partnerships, businesses or companies.
Our investments are transparent and disclosed in our published annual accounts and are in accordance with our Ethical Investment Policy .
We shall also be establishing a University Investment Committee that will include a student representative nominated by the Students’ Union.
The University supports all its academic staff in freely collaborating, within the law, with other academics in the UK and internationally on externally funded research projects.
As part of our commitment to transparency, we will provide details of these projects to the Students' Union, except where we are under a legal duty of confidentiality.
We have recently launched the Aston Humanitarian Scholarship scheme which will provide financial support to eligible students from distressed parts of the world, including Gaza, to have an inclusive and equitable chance of education at Aston University.
We have the Ernest Edward Scholarship that offers up to four sanctuary scholarships to students who are seeking refuge in the UK.
We also work closely with Cara (Council for At-Risk Academics) to support academic communities (students and staff) in danger, which provides additional opportunities for support.
Supporting all our students is a key priority at Aston University.
We offer various support schemes and funds specifically designed to assist students facing hardship, particularly those from low income backgrounds or dealing with unforeseen circumstances.
Furthermore, we have committed to investing over two million pounds into International scholarships to help students develop, up-skill and prepare them for their future careers.
We are aware that some of our students are deeply affected by the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and hold strong views about the situation.
Our priority at this difficult time is to ensure that our campus remains a safe place for all our students and staff and to do all we can to prevent hate crime, antisemitism, Islamophobia and intolerance.
In line with our commitment to freedom of speech, we provide a supportive environment for all our students to express their views, debate and discuss this crisis, within the law and with respect and tolerance.
However, this does not extend to disrupting University operations or the work of our staff and students by setting up tents where there is no authority or permission to do so on University private land.
The presence of the camp, which to the best of our knowledge also includes individuals who are not members of the University community, is causing disruption to planned University activities and making some of our staff and students feel unsafe.
The University has therefore issued a notice requesting the protesters with set-up tents to vacate its property.
If they do not do so, they may be subject to legal action.
Any discrimination or intimidation against students, staff or University visitors resulting from events unfolding in the Middle East is unacceptable, and we urge anyone facing antisemitism, Islamophobia, harassment or discrimination of any kind to inform the University by calling our campus safety team on 0121 359 2922 or by emailing campussafety@aston.ac.uk .

Many students do not consider themselves to have a disability.
However, there are times where students experience barriers, and we are here to help remove those barriers.
We have a team of advisers to support any disabled or neurodivergent student who have:
We are here to help remove barriers to ensure students have the best opportunity to progress and succeed in their studies, but making sure the most appropriate support is put in place.

You may be able to enrol at Aston early, and avoid the queues!
Sharing, or ‘disclosing’ a disability means giving details about the effect your disability or neurodiversity has on your day-to-day life.
This information is used to assess what support is required.
We recommend contacting us as soon as possible to ensure your support is in place early.
You are under no obligation to disclose, but if you choose not to, then you are unlikely to receive the full support you are entitled to.
With permission, we liaise with your academic department, and, where appropriate, central University departments such as the Exams Office.
Any information that you provide will be dealt with confidentially and separately from your academic application.
We will NOT contact your academic department without your permission.
If your disclosure is 'limited' to either departmental staff or the Disability and Neurodiversity Support Team, the support available may be more limited.
Although we co-ordinate support across the University, we may be unable to arrange some type of support without the involvement of specific staff (i.e.
exams, heads of department etc.).
Please contact our self-referral form along with supporting documentation or evidence as early as possible.
The form for applicants can be found here.
The evidence must either be the original version written in English, or an original copy in a language other than English, accompanied by an official translation.
The translation must be by a professional translator, often referred to as a 'sworn translator' in the EU.
Further guidance as to what information is suitable can be found on the Disabled Students UK website .

Our Non-Medical Helper Scheme (NMH)
The University does not provide support or funding for Personal Care or medical treatment (including medication, medical supplies or mobility equipment) because these things would be required even if you were not a student.
Any travel costs to receive medical treatment are also your responsibility.
If you need any non-academic support with daily living tasks such as personal care, shopping, cooking and laundry you will need to access this support independently.
If you require on-going personal assistance, we expect you to employ a care assistant, and you would need to pay for this yourself or other funding means.
Charges will vary depending on the type of support that may be required, and arrangements would need to be confirmed well in advance of you arriving at university.
We can advise on potential local sources of personal care support if necessary, although we do not recommend any specific agency and accept no liability as regards all aspects of support provided by care providers.
Wheelchairs can be rented from a local mobility hire provider if needed.
We are happy to talk to you about financial assistance towards academic and non-academic disability-related costs, although please be aware that any alternative sources of funding are likely to be limited and need to be applied for well in advance of your arrival.
We also have a document for Information for Visiting Personal Care Assistants .
We recognise how important caregiver support can be for students at university and that some students may wish for their caregivers to be able to contact us and be kept informed of support during their transition to university.
We may be able to discuss applicant queries with caregivers, with consent.
Any communication with current students will be directly with the student.
In line with the university privacy policy and obligations under GDPR, we cannot share student information.
Students with daily living skills usually find the transition to university smoother and less stressful.
They are generally more able to manage the other aspects of University life.
It is strongly recommended that the student is able to arrange their own daily living tasks, including personal care, shopping, cooking, laundry and good sleeping patterns, as we do not provide this service.
Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) is a non-means-tested and non-repayable source of funding available to Home students, intended to help meet the extra disability-related costs incurred while studying at University.
This fund can help to pay for additional support such as study skills tuition, mentoring support, and software and equipment support.
The fund pays for the support directly and so you do not get any additional money directly.
The support you receive from the University is in many ways independent of the support you receive through DSA, and if you choose not to apply for DSA you can still receive support from the University.
However, certain types of support are likely to be unavailable without the appropriate funding in place.
More information can be found on the UCAS website or by contacting us.
We also have a Frequently Asked Questions page for DSA.
If you are a full time enrolled Undergraduate student, and your DSA confirmation of funding letter includes the purchase of a laptop, you may be awarded a one-off £200 grant to cover your contribution towards the cost of the laptop.
Please contact us for more information regarding eligibility.
There is an additional support fund available for disabled students who are on the Erasmus+ programme at Aston.
For further information please contact erasmus@aston.ac.uk
International and EU students are not normally eligible for the same financial support as UK-resident students and we strongly advise that you ensure appropriate funding is in place before you arrive at university.
Aston University will make every effort to help you find ways of paying for any support you need, but you or your sponsors may be asked to pay for resources or equipment such as personal care, study support workers, sign language interpreters, equipment or extensive brailing.
You should contact us as early as possible for advice.
The following policies and guidance documents detail relevant processes and procedures for students.

This module addresses the ongoing paradigm shift in evaluation of forensic evidence away from methods based on human perception and subjective judgement to methods based on relevant data, quantitative measurements, and statistical models.
6 months (access to resources for 1 year)
There is an ongoing paradigm shift in evaluation of forensic evidence away from methods based on human perception and subjective judgement to methods based on relevant data, quantitative measurements, and statistical models; methods that are transparent and reproducible, use the logically correct framework for interpretation of forensic evidence (the likelihood-ratio framework), are resistant to cognitive bias, and are calibrated and validated under casework conditions.
The paradigm shift is spreading across different branches of forensic science, and there is a need for more forensic practitioners and lawyers to have a working knowledge of the concepts of forensic inference and statistics.
This continuing-professional-development (CPD) module will provide you with a conceptual understanding of forensic inference and statistics, including an understanding of the likelihood-ratio framework for interpretation of forensic evidence.
The focus of the module is on understanding of concepts rather than practical implementation skills.
No prior knowledge of statistics is assumed.

The module is delivered entirely online.
Learning resources are provided via the Blackboard Ultra virtual learning environment, and via the University’s library.
You can take the module from anywhere in the world as long as you have a good internet connection.
The module includes regular interactive seminars and tutorials.
As necessary, seminars and tutorials will be scheduled to accommodate participants in different time zones, e.g., early morning and/or evening UK time.
The module consists of nine units of learning and two assessments of competency.
A flipped-classroom active-learning approach is adopted whereby transfer of information primarily takes place via pre-recorded lectures, other videos, and readings before class, and class time is used for interactive activities aimed at developing analytical skills and deeper understanding.
Each unit is delivered over a two-week period.
For each unit, you will be provided with pre-class watching and reading and with questions and/or activities to guide your watching and reading.
Each unit includes a two-hour-long seminar (in the first week) and a one-hour-long tutorial (in the second week).
Seminars consist of small-group and whole-class interactive activities based on the pre-class watching and reading.
During tutorials, the instructor responds to questions posed by participants.
After each seminar, you will also be provided with an online didactic quiz.
An online didactic quiz presents 10 questions randomly selected from a much larger question bank, and provides immediate feedback on your answers.
Each quiz can be repeated multiple times.
A different set of questions will be presented each time.
Learning is cumulative and cyclical, with later parts of the module drawing on concepts covered in earlier parts of the module.
Assessment is via two online tests that have the same format as each unit’s online didactic quiz.
This is designed to encourage you to exploit the learning opportunities provided by the didactic quizzes, and in turn to exploit the learning opportunities provided by the pre-class watching and reading questions and by the in-class activities.
The first test occurs in the middle of the module.
The questions in the first test will assess your knowledge and understanding of the material covered in the first half of the module.
The second test occurs at the end of the module.
The questions in the second test will assess your knowledge and understanding of the material covered in the whole module, with a greater proportion of questions focusing on the second half of the module.
The tests are designed to assess competency.
In order to demonstrate competency (and be awarded a pass), a you must achieve a raw score of 80% or more by correctly answering 80 or more of the 100 questions spread across the two tests.
If you do not demonstrate competency on your first attempt, you will be able to engage in additional study (and can receive support from the instructor), and will be able to reattempt one or both of the tests.
If you achieve a raw score of 80% or more on the second attempt, you will be awarded a pass.
What matters is that you achieve and demonstrate a sufficient level of competency, not how long it takes you to do so.

Some of the differences are:
Depending on who enrols and where they are, we plan to schedule seminars and tutorials early morning UK time and evening UK time.
This will provide an afternoon or evening option if you are in Asia or Australasia, and a morning or early afternoon option if you are in North America or South America.
If you are in Europe or Africa, you will potentially be able to choose between morning or evening options.
If you live in Hawai’i or elsewhere in the central Pacific, it may not be possible to schedule the seminars and tutorials at a reasonable time.
Material from “Concepts” has previously been used in workshops for lawyers and in workshops for judges and those workshops have received favourable feedback.
“Concepts” includes one unit on interpretation of DNA profiles, including probabilistic genotyping, but it is at an introductory level.
It includes coverage of gamma distributions because they relate to concepts that can be generalised beyond their application in probabilistic genotyping.
“Concepts” would be a useful foundation if you want to later specialise in interpretation of DNA profiles, but it does not cover the more advanced statistical methods (including Monte Carlo fitting methods) that are used by STRmix® and by TrueAllele®.
“Concepts” includes a unit on forensic voice comparison, but it is at an introductory level and focuses on concepts that are generalisable to other branches of forensic science.
It does cover, at a conceptual level, use of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract DNN-embeddings (such as x-vectors) and calculation of likelihood ratios from DNN-embeddings.
The latter methods can be generalised for use in other branches of forensic science such as facial-image comparison, comparison of fired cartridge cases, and comparison of finger mark and fingerprint images.
In the future, we hope to offer a course on forensic voice comparison, including practical application skills.
“Concepts” would be a prerequisite course for the course in forensic inference and statistics.
After you have demonstrated competency, you will be awarded a “pass” for the module.
After official approval by the module and programme boards, you will be awarded Master’s level credits (15 UK credits / 7.5 ECTS credits), and will receive an Aston Credit Certificate .
We will also provide an explanatory letter explaining that passing the module was based on a competency assessment with a passing grade of 80%.
After official approval, you will also be able to request an official transcript which will show that you passed the module.
At your request, a transcript can be sent directly to a third party.
If you are a member of the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences (CSFS), you will be able to register your successful completion of the module and receive 150 points in CSFS’s CPD Scheme.

Graduates have become thought leaders and have been successful in the following roles:
A DBA is the same level of education as a PhD.
Both are research-oriented degrees that confer the title of Doctor and both degrees require candidates to conduct original research and make a significant contribution to knowledge.
The research context and typical candidate profiles however differ between the degrees.
The DBA is considered a professional doctorate geared towards executives and high-level managers.
In a DBA, the focus is on using theory and research to design robust interventions that address real-world business issues.
An impact on professional practice is thus achieved.
On the other hand, typically, a PhD focuses on more theoretical research seeking to identify new theories or extend existing ones.
And PhD candidates are typically in the early stages of their academic careers.
A Doctor of Business Administration is the next step past an MBA and the highest level of business administration degree.
You can establish yourself as a thought leader through meaningful data-driven research founded on advanced academic theory and contemporary business research that impacts business practice.
Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton created new theories – that level of academic endeavour isn’t what’s required.
What you must do in a doctoral thesis is contribute to knowledge both for practice and academia.
Just like in natural and physical sciences we have social science theories and the opportunity for a DBA student is to apply these theories to a practical business problem, in a way that creates new knowledge.
DBA students have an edge over PhD students because they are closer to practice and can access data – that is always a big challenge for academics.
The programme is offered on a part-time basis.
In accordance with University Regulations for part-time research students, the earliest date for completion of the doctoral programme (i.e., submission of thesis) is four years following registration.
This may be extended to a maximum of six years.
See our guidance notes on developing a research proposal.
Your research proposal is a critical component of your application.
It offers an overview of your research agenda and provides the reader with (a) an understanding of the key research question(s), (b) the context, background, and relevance of these questions, (c) potential research methods that could address the questions in a timely manner (these can be broad), and (d) the anticipated contribution to current understanding in the field or professional practice.
The proposal should also indicate the current state of knowledge in the research area (i.e., relevant theories and literature) and potential data sources to address the research question(s).
Ideally, the proposal identifies the department(s) most closely aligned with the research.
In essence, the research proposal clearly communicates what is to be researched, motivates and justifies the proposed research, explains how the research will be undertaken, and provides an indication of the usefulness of the results it generates to the field or professional practice.
It is important to note that the research proposal is an outline of your intended research trajectory and will evolve as you become more familiar with the literature and theories surrounding your research area over the course of the program.
Therefore, you are not expected to conduct a comprehensive review of the outstanding literature or research associated with your research area, nor confirm methodological approaches to resolving the research problem at this stage.
However, you are expected to convey your current line of thought and knowledge about a given research issue or problem and potential approaches for analysing it.
Given that the proposal is a concise blueprint for the research to be undertaken, it should be between 1000-1400 words.
Finally, the research proposal must have a succinct and meaningful title, which is excluded from the suggested word limit.
Guidance for research proposal
Be prepared to talk about your research question in an academic context – so why would knowledge in this area be different – be capable of making a contribution?
Most importantly find out about Aston Research Centres and the research profiles of our academics.
These outline the research we specialise in and want to receive proposals about.
If you can read some journal articles – do any call for more research on your topic?

It is our aim to prepare you for the demands of a medical career, with an emphasis on working compassionately with patients as partners, within a multi-disciplinary team.
Throughout Phase 1 you will develop your clinical skills and knowledge in blocks covering topics such as physiology, pharmacology, public and global health, and the musculoskeletal system.
You’ll be introduced to clinical practice, learn how to interact effectively with patients, carers, colleagues and other healthcare professionals, develop consultation skills as well as an introduction to diagnostic reasoning.
The very early clinical experience placement gives you an opportunity to develop an understanding of what it’s like to be a patient and to gain real-world experience of the work carried out by doctors and other members of the general practice (primary care) team.
Much of your learning in Phase 2 will take place in clinical environments, working with practising doctors and healthcare professionals.
Your progress will be supplemented and supported with lectures, group work, workshops, independent study and other learning opportunities.
The Student Selected Components delivered in this phase, offer you the chance to study an area of particular interest.
You will also have the opportunity, as an option within the Student Selected Component (SSC), to complete a research-based project with the Aston Medical Research Institute whose four themes of research include: maternal health, mental health, cardiovascular medicine and regenerative medicine.
Our modern and friendly campus is equipped with dedicated facilities for Aston Medical School students.

Widening participation is not just about ensuring medical students reflect all social backgrounds but it is also about ensuring that those who have disabilities (for example, physical, mental or learning disabilities) are encouraged and supported to study and practise medicine.
Doctors should reflect the societies they serve and disabilities, as long as they do not risk patient safety, should not be a hurdle to potential medical applicants.
The GMC states that ‘ Disabled learners should be welcomed and valued by the profession ’.
Aston Medical School welcomes applications from candidates who have disabilities and in line with recommendations from the Higher Education Occupational Physicians/Practitioners (HEOPS), we encourage you to get in touch with the Admissions Team if you would like to meet with key staff members to discuss anything with us before you apply.
Identifying your needs early in the admissions process will ensure that we provide optimal support, including any reasonable adjustments throughout the selection process.
For more information on the criteria for medical fitness to train, please visit the HEOPS website which lists the key areas in their document ‘ Medical Students – Standards of medical fitness to train ’.
It may also be useful for you to look at the General Medical Council’s document entitled Outcomes for Graduates , which details ALL the outcomes which must be met by medical students before they graduate.
If you consider yourself to have a disability, additional needs (for example, dyslexia) or any relevant medical conditions, you must declare this on your UCAS application form and inform our Admissions Team if any matters arise subsequent to the submission of your application.
This is essential for medicine (and a requirement of the GMC) as this information will help us identify areas that need to be addressed at an early stage and will help us to ensure we provide appropriate support to you.
Academic assessment for all applicants will be independent of any declaration of disability.
We encourage applicants with disabilities and will make reasonable adjustments to ensure that all applicants are considered equally in the selection process including the MMIs and successfully complete their studies.
We will contact all applicants with a disability who are invited for interview to discuss their requirements ahead of the interview date.

We have an exciting and vibrant research environment at Aston Business School that enables our PhD students to be engaged in various research events and seminars (Aston Business School-wide and PhD-specific).
Our PhDs have a dedicated research society which organises various social and academic related events throughout the year, including the BSS Annual Doctoral Conference.
We strongly believe that these activities are an essential part of ensuring our PhD students are engaged and motivated throughout the duration of their PhD journey.
The BSS PhD Hub offers our doctoral researchers the opportunity for further training skills development from experts across the College.
Our academic departments also run research seminar series (and other activities) where PhD students are encouraged to present their research and get feedback from colleagues.
All students can access up to £1,500 for presenting at academic conferences and to help further develop their research knowledge, skills, abilities and professional development.
In the first year you will undertake three ESRC approved taught Research Methods modules.
These modules are designed to provide you with the necessary skills to both successfully complete your PhD, and to develop as a well-rounded researcher.
In line with ESRC initiatives, the Research Methods course is taught by experts across the College of Business and Social Sciences and involves modules on (1) Research Design, Practice and Ethics, (2) Fundamentals in Quantitative Research Methods, and (3) Foundations in Qualitative Research Methods.
These modules are designed to support the development of your research project and, ultimately, support the submission of a final Qualifying Report towards the end of Year 1.
The Qualifying Report is an extended research proposal that details your proposed research aims and objectives, contributions to current academic and –where appropriate –practitioner knowledge, and the research strategy, design, and methods you intend to employ to meet these aims and objectives.
You are required to defend your Qualifying Report through a viva voce oral examination involving two internal academic examiners, one of whom will be familiar with the subject area.
Upon successful completion of this examination, you will then be allowed to proceed onto the PhD Programme.
During the second year you will typically concentrate on obtaining ethical approval for your research, before focusing on data collection and analysis.
For some students this will involve travel to external research sites where data is collected.
Towards the end of Year 2, you are required to communicate and defend your research progress.
This is either through:
Year three is typically a writing up year, where you will spend most of your time developing your thesis.
We also encourage all students to submit to important academic conferences in order to communicate their research to an external audience and obtain essential feedback before submitting their final thesis for viva voce examination towards the end of Year 3.
Attending conferences, and receiving feedback, is also an essential first step in getting your research published in top tier academic journals in your discipline.
A Masters degree in business, management, or the social sciences (or related disciplines) with a Merit overall (or equivalent) with a dissertation/research element, PLUS a First or Upper Second Class Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification from an overseas institution).

He is the PhD Lead in law and is happy to discuss proposals before you make an application.
PhD students who are studying at Aston Law School become part of an exciting and vibrant research environment.
At Aston Law, our approach is to develop strong connections between supervisors and PhD students, which is integral for the development of a successful PhD.
Ultimately, each PhD project will be different and unique to each student, but students will have the support they need to develop as a researcher and successfully to defend their PhD.
Our PhD students will also have the opportunity to study and form relationships with the wider community of PhD students across the College of Business and Social Sciences.
A number of events are organised, both academic and social, which help to ensure that our PhD students are engaged and motivated throughout the duration of their PhD journey.
In the first year students will undertake three ESRC approved taught Research Methods modules.
These modules are designed to provide students with the necessary skills to both successfully complete their PhD, and to develop as a well-rounded researcher.
During year one students will also work towards completing their Qualifying Report, the content of which should be determined by the nature of their project.
Students who are engaging with doctrinal research and secondary materials will have the opportunity to refine their project and to get feedback on early drafts of their chapters.
In previous years, students who engaged with doctrinal research have focused on developing at least one chapter to showcase their PhD and wider arguments.
In contrast, students who are engaged with empirical research will normally spend the first year refining their methodology and the design of their project.
All students, whether studying doctrinal or empirical research, will submit their Qualifying Report at the end of the first year.
It is assessed through a viva voce oral examination involving two academic examiners, one of whom will be familiar with the subject area.
Upon successful completion of this examination, the student is confirmed on the PhD programme.
The second year provides an opportunity to incorporate or respond to changes or suggestions provided from the Qualifying Report, and this should also provide a better insight into the next steps for developing the PhD.
In previous years, PhD students have also applied to present at external conferences such as the Society of Legal Scholars conference.
Students engaging in empirical research will typically concentrate on obtaining ethical approval for their research, before focusing on data collection and analysis.
Towards the end of Year 2, students are required to communicate and defend their research progress.
By year three, students should have draft versions of most of their chapters.
It is often the case that developments in later chapters will require earlier chapters to be revisited, and in some areas of law the fast-moving nature of law also means that new legal developments need to be incorporated.
If they have not done so at this stage, we would also encourage all students to submit to important academic conferences in order to communicate their research to an external audience and to develop their research profile.
For those seeking to pursue a career in academia, students are also encouraged to consider sending work for publication such as case notes or shorter articles.
At the end of the final year, students will submit their thesis and will have a formal viva voce examination, where their finished PhD is examined by one internal and one external examiner.
The PhD programme recruits students to start in either October or April and, depending on the desired start point, applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible to avoid delays.
Making an application can be split into the following steps:
Dr Inez Brown has been recognised for her 20 year career in law.
