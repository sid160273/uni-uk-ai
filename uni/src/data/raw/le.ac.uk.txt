The University of Leicester is striving to make itself a place that welcomes people with refugee backgrounds, is understanding towards their needs and provides opportunities through a range of initiatives.
Through its work in this area, it was awarded University of Sanctuary status in a special ceremony attended by Sir David Attenborough on 11 November 2018.
Sir David said:
"This University has a wonderful reputation for humanity, for culture, for generosity as do the citizens of this ancient noble city.
I believe it will continue because you have now become a University of Sanctuary offering scholarships to people who come here for many reasons to seek safety, sanctuary and learning.
And you, the citizens of this city, will be supporting them and I hope will continue to support them."
The University has indeed continued to develop its support for sanctuary seekers, such as through adopting the City of Sanctuary UK Charter , expanding its range of academic sanctuary scholarships , spearheading much needed research into trauma-informed ESOL pedagogy , working closely with local and national partners to offer joined up services, supporting educational projects such as Bright Path Futures and t he RefugEAP Programme which place well-being and thriving at their core, running a flagship annual series of events entitled Breaking Barriers Refugee Week , and establishing a Sanctuary Seekers’ Unit to continue to take this work forward.
These activities are well aligned with the University’s Citizens of Change agenda and its strategic direction and values – to be inclusive, inspiring and impactful.
We are also pleased that much of our work in this area contributes to a number of the the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals .
In particular, we are proud to have signed up to the UN’s ‘ 15 by 30’ pledge , by which participating universities contribute to the aim of opening up participation to HE to 15% of the world’s refugees by 2030 (building on the current figure of 7%, which sits in stark contrast to the 40% global average for non-refugees).
We aim to move closer to this target every day, both through our work and through supporting the work of others.

The University had kept them in good condition with the original décor in place but no sharing!
We were three to a room.
However, we did leave the students with a new tree which we planted in the garden to commemorate the University’s Centenary and our own residency at Shirley.
David Ashton (Social Sciences BA, 1964) was joined in this reunion, by Geoff Gibbons, Jack Kelly, Mervyn Message and their respective wives together with Malcolm Johnson.

We all thoroughly enjoyed it.
As you probably gathered, we'd all had an absolutely fabulous time at Leicester and at Beaumont in particular, and it was great to see the campus and hall again.
Thanks too to Vicky and the garden staff for arranging the tree for our friend, Keith.
The location is perfect.
We'll be sending photos to his family.
Paul Illott (History BA, 1985)
A New Year's resolution posted on Facebook to get back in touch face to face with old friends led to the decision to hold a 40 years since graduation reunion.
So the day came and a few of us met for lunch at The Craddock Arms (of course).
A stroll down Queens Road to the University brought back many memories.
In the evening, we gathered in the old JCR bar for drinks and then had a superb buffet in the old dining room.
More drinks in the JCR bar, where we recreated some old photos, and then off to The Craddock Arms for a nightcap.
A big thank you to the College Court staff and the Alumni Team for making the reunion such a special time.
It was a memorable reunion with an opportunity to catch up with everyone and for old friendships to be rekindled.
And now  to start planning the next one!

Over the years, I have often reflected on how blessed I was to have studied chemistry at The University of Leicester.
Having led large organisations for many years there is no doubt in my mind that a background in chemistry was, and continues to be, a gateway to using science for the benefit of mankind.
Even with the explosive pace of scientific advances over the last decade, a knowledge of molecular interactions continues to be a key to unlocking the potential of science.
The time I spent as a PhD student of Paul Jenkins turned out to be foundational for my career, something for which I am eternally grateful and should have told him more often.
Beyond Paul's scientific mentorship, his values and humanity were a lifelong lighthouse.
Years later, as I started to lead large teams of people, I realised that I had also (subliminally) benefitted from the sense of community created by the academic staff in the Organic Chemistry Department.
Paul Jenkins, Paul Cullis, Bob Atkinson, Martin Harger, John Malpass and Stuart Trippet helped create a diverse, inclusive environment.
This sense of community and safe harbour was something that I tried to emulate in my own personal leadership journey over the last 35+ years.
Like many alumni, I have many memories that I could share, but the experience below is one I will never forget.
For the non-chemists reading this, please forgive the chemistry detour, which provides context.
As Paul Jenkins' first PhD student, I was given the opportunity to work on the synthesis of taxane (or at least the fundamental core tricyclic ring structure).
The central inventive step was to build a framework with a tethered diene and dienophile that would create the tricyclic ring structure via an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction.
After over two years, I finally got to the point of having the Diels-Alder precursor.
I vividly remember telling Paul on a Friday evening that, at long last, we were ready.
He was as excited as I was and clearly expected that I would go straight back to the lab and run the pivotal reaction.
When I told him I was going to the pub and would get around to it on Monday, a look of dismay appeared on his face.
However, to his credit, he kept his calm and said OK!
The truth was that I wanted some breathing space to prepare myself before trying this make or break reaction.
So Sunday morning, I went into the lab and ran the experiment.
Within a few hours I knew that the reaction had worked.
I ran the NMR and then drove down to Paul's house, knocked on his door and when he opened it, I just held up the NMR in front of him.

Following the completion of a BSc (Hons) Chemistry degree at the University of Leicester in 1984, I pursued a PhD in Chemistry (awarded in 1987) in the same department under the supervision of Dr Michael J.
Blandamer.
The research conducted in the preparation of my thesis, 'Kinetics of Aqueous Solutions', provided me with a deep understanding of chemical thermodynamics and, more specifically, the thermodynamics of aqueous solutions.
In November of 1987, I married University of Leicester alumna Linda Cook (BA Economics and Economic History, 1985) and moved to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where I commenced work at the University of Alberta as a post-doctoral fellow, under the supervision of Professor Loren G.
Hepler.
In the summer of 1989, I joined the University of Lethbridge (located in southern Alberta) as a tenure track Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry.
I established a nationally-funded research program in the area of solution thermodynamics in which I specialized in the volumetric and thermochemical properties of aqueous systems.
In 1994, I was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor, and in 2000 I received the University of Lethbridge Distinguished Teacher Award.
In 2003 I was promoted to the rank of Professor.
As a nationally funded researcher (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), I was particularly interested in the techniques of calorimetry and densitometry and was successful in designing and building a densimeter (an instrument that measures the densities of fluids) that could operate with high precision at elevated temperatures and pressures.
I used this instrument to look at the temperature and pressure dependencies of the volumetric properties of aqueous systems of biological importance.
This included some of the first reported measurements for aqueous amino acid systems.
My research program benefitted immeasurably from the contributions of the many undergraduate summer research assistants who worked in my laboratory, the graduate students I supervised, and the many research collaborators.
In my years as an active researcher, I authored or co-authored 58 peer-reviewed journal articles as well as several book chapters, gave numerous conference presentations across the world, and in 2003 was honoured to receive the Stig Sunner Memorial Award.
The International Calorimetry Conference awarded the latter in recognition of research and other contributions to the field of thermochemistry by an individual aged 40 or less.
I served as Chair of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at the University of Lethbridge for four years, beginning in 1999, on numerous university and faculty association committees, and became President of the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association in 2001.
In 2005, I moved into university administration as the Associate Vice-President (Academic) before accepting an appointment as the University Provost and Vice-President (Academic) in 2007.
There are many things I am proud of in my tenure as Provost and VPA, including the creation of a School of Liberal Education, progress with the indigenization of the university and the completion of a $280 million science building.
In July 2020, after 31 years at the University of Lethbridge, I moved to Antigonish, Nova Scotia, in eastern Canada, to become the 19th President and Vice-Chancellor of St.
Francis Xavier University.
The world of chemistry has experienced an explosion in the amount of new knowledge that is published and disseminated each year.
Keeping up with what is known, and what can be trusted, has become highly challenging.
Increasingly, some of the most interesting questions to be answered lie at the intersections of allied fields like biochemistry, physics, and mathematics.
Therefore, to make progress in chemistry, it is highly advantageous to bring an understanding of such subjects to the table.
In other words, the complexity of today's biggest questions requires analyses through many different lenses, and the strength of a researcher can often be measured in terms of the number of approaches and lenses they can focus on a problem.
In this sense, the strength of a science education can be significantly enhanced by the many skills one can learn through exposure to a liberal education.
Good communication skills remain at a premium, as are abilities to translate the complexity of scientific outcomes and data into vocabulary and descriptions from which society can more easily benefit.
The latter point, in my opinion, is of paramount importance to the future of science.
There is no shortage of new knowledge, but knowledge translation needs to keep pace.
Dr Michael J.
Blandamer served as my Senior Undergraduate Project Supervisor, and the work that was conducted on that project led to my first co-authorship on a publication*.
It was this work on the kinetics of reactions in microemulsion systems that gave me my first real taste of research in the area of physical chemistry, and encouraged me to pursue a SERC funded PhD under Professor Blandamer's supervision.
Mike was a very generous man with an encyclopaedic knowledge of thermodynamics.
He was always willing to share his thoughts and ideas.
I have never met his equal in terms of his abilities to navigate the mathematically and equation structured world of thermodynamics, and it was his skill as a supervisor that put me on a path to a career in academia.
Mike's lab, which I shared with then PhD candidate Barbara Clark, was always a hive of activity in terms of projects to work on and ideas to consider.
Proudly displayed on the wall of his lab were posters advertising the Calgary Stampede (an annual rodeo event held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada).
Mike had spent time at the University of Calgary with Professor Ross Robertson and had developed a soft spot for the Alberta way of life.
This must have rubbed off on me.
Thanks to Mike, on the completion of my PhD I accepted a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, in the laboratory of Professor Loren G.
I will always be grateful to Mike for his mentorship and support, and for constantly demonstrating to me what it means to be a good colleague through the many collaborations he fostered.
Mike made a huge difference to my life, for which I will always be grateful.
I am proud of the 17 publications to which I made contributions as an undergraduate and as a PhD student under his supervision.

I, 2357-2363, 81, (1985).
Throughout my career as an academic, I have attempted to follow the path shown to me by those who had the most significant impact on my life; Professor Michael (Mike) Blandamer and Professor Loren Hepler.
Be generous with your ideas and try to make a difference with all that you do.
Treat everyone around you in the manner that you like to be treated, with kindness and respect and never forget to listen, as there will always be something to learn.
In terms of advice to students, I would say get involved, get to know your professors and supervisors beyond the classroom experience and remember never to stop asking questions.
Find the answers to good questions that help move all of us forward.
Be inquisitive.
After leaving Leicester with a PhD I moved to the US to complete a post-doctorate with Prof.
Jay Kochi (1967-69).
From there, I joined Shell Research in Amsterdam, where I was concerned with developing new, more environmentally friendly processes for bulk and fine chemicals using clean, catalytic technologies.
I met my wife in Amsterdam and have lived in the Netherlands ever since.
In 1980 I moved to DSM-Andeno as Research and Development Director, where I became involved in developing cleaner catalytic processes for the manufacture of pharma intermediates.
In this period, I invented the E factor (kg waste per kg product) for measuring the waste produced in chemical manufacturing processes.
The E factor was adopted by both industry and academia and I became known worldwide as Mr E factor.
I also became interested in biocatalysis during this period and my interest in both chemo and biocatalysis continued and intensified when I moved to the Delft University of Technology (TUD) as a Professor of (Bio)catalysis and Organic Chemistry in 1990.
Following my retirement from the TUD in 2007, I continued as CEO of CLEA Technologies.
I then became a distinguished Professor of Biocatalysis Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2015.
For more details of my career and honours and awards received, see www.sheldon.nl.
I currently consider a few challenges for the profession: facilitating the ongoing transition to a climate-neutral, low-carbon energy base and a circular, waste-free bio-economy.
Also, research at the cross-roads of chemistry, biology and medicine, for example, in developing treatments for a variety of disabling and life-threatening metabolic disorder diseases.
I enjoyed my time at Leicester.
I made a lot of friends (some of which I am still in contact with) and I learnt a lot from my co-supervisors, Professor Stuart Trippett and Professor Stephen Davidson.
Pick a subject that is interesting and important from both a societal and scientific viewpoint and go for it.

Early medieval urban development in Britain has proven a vexing question, with oversimplified narratives often dominating discussions.
Existing research has considered the competing roles of kings and artisans in urban emergence.
This talk examines Ipswich (AD 600-900), arguably England's oldest continuously inhabited town, to challenge top-down, mono-causal models of town formation.
In contrast to previous research, it investigates interactions between human and non-human actors, focussing on Buttermarket and Franciscan Way as detailed case studies.
Findings suggest that urban development is not a singular event but a continuous, evolving process shaped by kings, commoners, craftspeople, and the environment.
Dr Fathy's research offers a nuanced framework for understanding towns as complex systems of interactions and material practices, advancing our comprehension of the dynamic development of early medieval urban landscapes.
Dr Brandon Fathy is a lecturer in later medieval archaeology at the University of Reading.
His research is motivated by the question, “what are the origins of towns and cities”.
Brandon is also interested in post humanist archaeology, thinking about how the vibrant and active capacities of matter and materials impact on processes like urban emergence.
His doctoral research explored the origins of early medieval Ipswich using spatial and statistical analysis among other tools.
He has also published on horse tack and the Portable Antiquities Scheme.
He completed his PhD in Archaeology at the University of Leicester in 2022 and was previously been awarded funding from the Medieval Academy of America (Schallek Award) and the Economic History Society.

The 2025 Dr.
Mark Sims Memorial Award for Public Service is presented to John Neville and Nick Johnson in recognition for their outstanding fundraising efforts in support of the Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) Research Foundation.
In May 2024, they organized the highest cricket game in England atop Helvellyn in the Lake District, successfully raising over £16,000, which was later matched by another donor.
The event involved a two-hour climb, with participants carrying a 125kg wicket mat to the summit.
They were joined by 11 players from their home club, Henley, and and a mixture of players from local clubs.
Charcot Marie Tooth disease is a group of inherited conditions that damage the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body.
CMT affects both motor and sensory nerves, disrupting signals to and from the brain.
This leads to numbness, sensory loss, muscle weakness, and nerve degeneration, progressively worsening over time.
Symptoms can appear from birth or during adulthood, with no available treatments or cures.
John has suffered from the onset of the disease since a teenager, and symptoms such as foot drop have got progressively worse as an adult.
He was able to reach the summit of Helvellyn using his walking aids.
John and Nick’s efforts have raised much-needed awareness and funding to CMT research, supporting the search for future treatments and improving the lives of those affected by the condition.

Esuantsiwa (Esua) Goldsmith is a trailblazing activist, writer, and campaigner who has dedicated her life to challenging inequality and advocating for social and political justice at local, national, and global levels.
Raised in the 1950s in South London, Stafford, and Norfolk by her mother and stepfather in a white working-class family, Esua experienced deep isolation and discrimination as a Mixed-Race child— “the only brown kid on the block,” as she describes herself.
These early experiences sparked a lifelong journey to understand her identity, leading her in adulthood to seek out her Ghanaian roots.
In her mid-thirties, she met her Ghanaian father for the first time and discovered her royal matrilineal heritage, descended from warrior queens.
After years of supporting development projects in her ancestral village—including school funding, public bathrooms, and street lighting—Esua was enstooled as Queen Mother of Development for Akoanso Village, Cape Coast, Ghana, in 2009.
Formerly known as Jane Goldsmith, she became the first woman of colour elected President of Leicester University Students’ Union in 1975.
As a student, she also led the Women’s Liberation Group, Anti-Apartheid Society, and a successful campaign for nursery provision for students' children—the Stanhope Nursery, still operating today.
In June 2025, she will unveil a plaque commemorating its 50th anniversary.
The University of Leicester commissioned a portrait of Esua in 2018 to mark the centenary of women’s suffrage and named a building after her on its Freeman’s site in 2022.
Esua has held numerous leadership roles inlcuding Commissioner for the Women’s National Commission, Chair and Co-Founder of the Gender and Development Network, Vice-Chair of ActionAid UK, and Chair of the Oxfam Assembly.
She was the first woman of colour elected Chair of the Fawcett Society in 2001 and served as Trustee for organisations including VSO, Akina Mama Wa Afrika, and the Equality and Diversity Forum.
She was also one of the first Black volunteers sent by Voluntary Service Overseas to Tanzania in 1977.
From 1985 to 1995, she was a global feminist leader during the UN Decade for Women, and part of the UK delegation to the 1995 UN Women’s Conference in Beijing.
In 1995, she founded Anona Development Consultancy, working across five continents with over 100 charities on gender and racial equity, anti-racism, decolonisation, and leadership.
Today, Esua remains deeply involved in the Healing Solidarity Collective, Black Lives Matter, the Reparations Movement, and the Black Writers Guild.
She is also a founding member of the Phenomenal Women Group and Vice Chair of her local Soul Disco in Wandsworth.
Her acclaimed 2020 memoir, The Space Between Black and White, explores her life as a Mixed-Race woman and has won critical praise.

Catherine began conversations with the Advancement Office at the University in 2017, proposing the installation of an organisation to allow US-based alumni to donate to the University tax efficiently, offering her services as a Trustee of this proposed organisation.
The American Friends of the University of Leicester was officially formed in 2020, and, in 2022, the Board established the American Friends PhD Scholarship to support PhD students, especially those who study by Distance Learning or have an affiliation with the USA through their subject or location.
Catherine has committed significant donations to this scholarship over the past three years, supporting our PhD scholars to study without worry.
Catherine also supported the inaugural Skylark Scholarship in memory of her grandparents who lived in Leicester.
Receiving the Rhoda Bennett Philanthropy Award recognises the impact that Catherine has had on Leicester’s overseas fundraising and highlights the kindness of Catherine’s donations towards various causes at the University.

Dr Justine Reilly is a social entrepreneur and believes in the power of an individual identifying a social need business gap which, when filled, is a force for good and change on a wide scale.
Justine set up Sporting Heritage in 2012, an organisation which would revolutionise how the museum and heritage sector responds to and addresses the history and heritage of sport.
Sporting Heritage works across the UK to support heritage to be removed from risk, celebrates this heritage, and tells stories of diversity, endeavor and communities through the sporting past.
In 2022, Justine set up The Neurodiverse Museum.
This is a nationwide organisation which is changing the way the heritage sector (and wider) thinks about and supports neurodivergent people.
It is using museums to reflect who neurodivergent people are by campaigning for equitable representation of neurodivergent people within formal heritage spaces and the heritage workforce.
With the aim of ensuring that music making, and live music access was made available to everyone within the community, in one of the most deprived wards, Justine led the set-up of Tutti, Leeds Community Concert Band in 2018.
The band is now embedded in community development and has over 70 members.
Justine is a champion for creating change and changing perceptions.
As an autistic person, she supports emerging neurodivergent women to develop their careers, access opportunities which would not otherwise be open to them, and advocates on a national level for the change needed to inform opportunities in this way.
Justine believes that her time at the University of Leicester was crucial in informing the work she does now.
She found the experience inspirational, and it sowed the seeds of her successful career and her ability to create positive social impact.

Anuj Ashar is a serial tech entrepreneur and the Founder/CEO of Launchpad AI, a platform developing websites and apps for high-growth potential startups.
He graduated from the University of Leicester with a BEng in Aerospace Engineering in 2022, with First Class Honours, and was recently appointed as the youngest ever individual to sit on the Leicester & Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership Innovation Board.
Anuj was 18 and studying at the University of Leicester when he launched his first startup, A-Pay.
Recognising the issue of students’ money management, Anuj scaled the company into multiple countries and secured a successful exit.
Innovate UK subsequently invited him to collaborate with the United Nations in supporting rural communities in South Africa, where he designed and implemented a low-cost system for digitalising payment systems in developing economies.
He received a £10,000 award along with investment from various global venture capitalists and as a result, at 19 years old, the UN named him one of the “Top three Global Young Innovators.”
Having successfully built two tech startups by the age of 21, Anuj went on to establish his third company, Launchpad AI.
This platform aims to remove the barriers of entry, particularly for non-technical entrepreneurs and startups, seeking website and app development by creating and utilising proprietary AI technology.
Launchpad AI has grown rapidly, and now has a team of 150 developers, with Anuj at the helm.
In 2023, Anuj established and founded a number of organisations alongside his mentor and Entrepreneur in Residence at the University, Shahid Sheikh OBE.
The first, which was born out of a love for cricket, is an E-Commerce platform dedicated to cricket fans around the world and has already grown to over 60 countries.
Dr Angela Stienne is a museum researcher, who graduated from the University of Leicester with an MA in Museum Studies in 2015 and a PhD in 2018.
With a specialist interest in making ethics conversations accessible in museums, Angela released her first book, Mummified, The stories behind Egyptian mummies in museums, in 2022.
She maintains connections with the University, taking the role of Disability Expert at the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries, whilst being an Honorary Research Fellow of the school of museum studies since 2018.
Angela has founded three internationally-acclaimed projects: Mummy Stories, the first participatory project on the ethics of human remains in museums; The Lyme Museum, an online museum making invisible illnesses and disabilities visible; and Museum Takeover, an award-winning relabelling of museum collections by refugees and asylum-seekers.
The Lyme Museum, established in 2020, is the first online museum to explore invisible illnesses and disabilities through materiality and storytelling.
Angela has drawn on her own diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease and Hypermobility syndrome, as well as her museum experience, to fundamentally change the perception and inherent ableism surrounding the lived experience of chronic illnesses and disabilities.
The Lyme Museum gives individuals around the world a platform to share their everyday lived experience.
Angela has grown a supportive community that feels truly represented by The Lyme Museum, in a way that other museums still struggle to do.
Her first in-person exhibition, The Materiality of Invisibility, was a thought-provoking display of flat lays of daily objects taken by individuals around the world; ever committed to the city of Leicester, it took place at the Documentary Media Centre in Leicester in 2022 and is now touring the UK.

Dorin Frăsîneanu completed the double LLB Law Maîtrise in 2016, studying at the University of Leicester and the University of Strasbourg.
He then went on to complete an M.P.Sc at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and an MA in European Political and Governance Studies at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium.
In February 2019, Dorin ran for MP in one of the newly created 51 constituencies in his home country, the Republic of Moldova.
Despite narrowly missing entry into the national parliament, he continued his career in the European Commission in areas related to diplomacy, international relations, and foreign policy.
In August 2021, Dorin returned to his home country after 11 years of living abroad, at the invitation of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova to join her cabinet as the PM’s Foreign Policy and EU Integration Adviser.
During his tenure, the Republic of Moldova faced multiple overlapping crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the energy crisis and the Russian war in neighbouring Ukraine, while the government was advancing ambitious anti-corruption, economic, and governance reforms.
Since the Republic of Moldova has received the largest influx of Ukrainian refugees per capita of any European country, Dorin was also appointed as the Head of the External Aid Coordination Unit in the Single Crisis Management Centre created for the management of the refugee crisis and combatting the effects of war.
The Republic of Moldova has faced numerous challenges in the 31 years since gaining independence.
In the last two years alone, the Moldovan citizens have been exposed to an acute economic and energy crisis, with an inflation rate that had reached a record high of 35% in October 2022, while 30% of the population continues living in poverty (the figure is expected to rise to almost 50% as a result of the effects of Russia's war in Ukraine).
Dorin has returned to his home country in August 2021 to contribute directly and to help bring change for the Moldovan citizens.

Megan is Co-President of the University’s astronomical society, Astrosoc, and successfully secured funding for 22 of its members to attend the prestigious UKSEDS National Student Space Conference.
As part of the fourth-year research project, Megan worked with members of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), a European Space Agency (ESA) mission, at the University.
Megan was tasked with developing an algorithm to assess two proposed trajectories, investigating the scientific opportunities offered by the different mission plans, and evaluating whether spacecraft resources, power and data rate, were capable of meeting the scientific requirements of several different instruments.
This was a challenge worthy of spacecraft planners in the ESA, yet Megan made progress with speed and has been performing at a level that would be impressive for a 1st year PhD student.
In the summer of 2021, Megan was awarded an extremely competitive internship with ESA with applications from across 20+ countries.
Working with a team at ESTEC, Megan developed a citizen-science project to search for satellite trails in Hubble Space Telescope observations.
Her contribution impressed her advisors and a paper is about to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal on the outcome.
Megan has been invited to represent the team at the European Astronomical Society meeting in Valencia, Spain, this summer.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shailesh and a group of University alumni established ‘PPE For Heroes’ to help provide free 3D printed face shields to frontline staff.
Shailesh led the initiative contacting alumni in the UK and India, establishing a network of 50 volunteers with nine 3D printers.
He also started a crowdfunding campaign raising over £1,500 in the UK and ₹50,000 (INR) in India to ensure they could buy raw materials, as well as establishing a website and social media platforms to take requests for face shields, mainly from care homes.
The initiative attracted local media attention and was featured on BBC Radio Leicester, as well as in the Institution of Mechanical Engineers newsletter.
Shailesh’s determination and professional and alumni network enabled him to have a positive impact on society in what was a challenging and frightening time for many.
Fellow alumni supporting Shailesh and this initiative include:
I was thrilled to be presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020 for my work as a songwriter and musician, after having been the principal songwriter and leader of Strawbs for over fifty years.
Unfortunately, two weeks after being presented with the Award the first lockdown started, but the band and I were determined to write and produce a whole new Strawbs album.
The first song wrote itself – ‘Strange Times’, and the album ‘Settlement’ was written and recorded remotely and released by Cherry Red Records in February 2021, reaching No 2 in the Official Folk Album charts and No 3 in the Official Progressive Album charts!
Winning an alumni award is recognition that my music has resonated around the world and is appreciated by people whose opinions I value and respect.
The promotional brochure from the University was far more interesting than any of the others I considered.
I was convinced that Leicester was where I wanted to study as their spirituality about the area was something that I had not experienced before, having lived in West London.
I deliberately chose the general degree and I am grateful to The University of Leicester for providing such broad subjects, as the breadth of knowledge that I gained from one-year courses in Psychology and British Archaeology broadened my horizons.
To this day I still use the mathematical disciplines in complex spread sheets not only for cash flow projections but also for planning social projects for The Commonwealth Medical Trust, of which I am a trustee.
The structured discipline has also been beneficial in the methodology of song writing, album planning, and tour budgeting.
When I reflect on my time at The University of Leicester, I am most grateful for the social experience of developing friendships with people who were far more mature than myself.
I have fond memories of becoming the first ever chairman of the newly formed University Folk Cub and my proudest moment was organising the University’s first Folk Festival.
I advise anyone who wishes to have a career within the music industry to get the best music business lawyer you can afford before signing any contract.
I wish I had taken my own advice!
During my time at the University of Leicester, I learned to look beyond the straightforward direct answer to any question and think laterally, giving me the grounding and confidence that I have relied on ever since.
For that, I am eternally grateful.
I aspire to write the songs for another Strawbs album in the future.
Find out more about what Future Leader alumni award winner Mesut, has achieved since graduating (including working as a researcher for The University of Leicester) and what winning an alumni award means to him.
At the time of receiving my award, I was completing a fellowship at the Science Museum, which ended in December 2019.
I then took an 18 month break to create an online museum called The Lyme Museum, which responded to current events and I also wrote my first book.
It was significant to get this award because my research in museum studies always felt a bit different from what others were doing, so to see my work with refugees and digital projects recognised meant a lot.
Also, growing up with an invisible disability meant that I did not see people like me doing great things and winning awards - there was a representation issue.
So, winning an award as a person with an invisible illness and disability was so important.
In 2013 I came to Leicester to complete MA in Museum Studies, as it was such a vibrant place and so multi-cultural.
I loved it and the University so much that I stayed for a PhD and I am now an Honorary Research Fellow!
But, for me, the most important thing it has taught me is the power of community and diversity.
Public speaking for sure!
I started giving my first talks during my PhD, and I got small grants to attend conferences.
This dramatically helped me to develop a strong skillset in public speaking and my work now would look very different if I did not gain this skill set during my time at Leicester.
I am incredibly grateful for the people I met during my time at Leicester - from my tremendous supervisors to friends for life who now live around the world.
Graduations were proud moments for me.
Having my parents and sister attend made my little childhood dream come true and I went on to earn a PhD in a foreign language!
When I think about the University of Leicester, I now know that the environment solidified my goal to continue with my studies and complete a PhD in just three years.
My advice for anyone that would like to enter a similar career as myself would be to practice communication skills as they are extremely important.
Also, make sure you try new things and stay curious as you can do many things with your studies, and you do not have to follow one set path.
Whilst studying at The University of Leicester, I discovered that I could use my voice to amplify important causes and give others a voice.
Furthermore, due to being in an environment that fostered independent thinking, I learned to have confidence in my ideas, that my opinion matters and that small projects can have a significant impact.
I attend online events as I returned to France 18 months ago.
I eagerly await returning to the UK to see my friends graduate and for the Centenary Alumni Celebration!
In the future, I plan to keep writing and developing digital and in-person projects that give people a voice and make them think 'wait, I feel seen, I matter, I am visible' when they head back home.
Since winning the Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award in 2015, I have stood down from my role as CEO at the Science Council and now support voluntary organisations and charities with good governance and strategy on a consultancy basis.
More recently, I have been working on developing a new volunteer-based literacy support scheme in East Sussex for early years students who have fallen even further behind during Covid, as well as joining the Construction Industry Training Board as an independent member.
Receiving an alumni award was an incredibly special experience.
Having my work recognised by the University helps to positively highlight the benefits of having a career in the voluntary sector.
Although I liked the idea of studying in a medium-size institution, it was in fact the course that made me choose The University of Leicester.
Having the opportunity to study five subjects in my first year, four of which were new to me, was an exciting and challenging opportunity that helped me understand a world way beyond my A level subjects.
Since graduating, I have been inspired to continuously campaign for the things I believe in and drive the implementation of change in the areas I think matter for society.
One of the top skills that I learned during my time at The University of Leicester, which I continue to use, is articulating my thoughts and ideas, both on paper and verbally.
As a result, I have the ability to put a good business case together, present it and win support.
Leicester was the right fit for me both academically and socially.
I am most grateful for having the personal support I needed at times of pressure and stress but also the space to develop who I am and get involved in voluntary activities in the town.
Reading my exam results and realising I had done well and that all my hard work was worth it, coupled with being awarded an Honorary Doctorate were two of the proudest moment during my time at The University of Leicester.
For anyone wishing to have a similar career path as me, I would advise whilst at University take up the opportunities on offer beyond your degree.
Your subject knowledge alone will rarely be enough to get on in life – the other skills matter equally as much.
Show your employers you are a well-rounded individual by getting involved in clubs, societies, campaigns, voluntary work.
Also remember you never stop learning, so read widely to understand the world around you.
Whilst studying at Leicester, I realised that I loved to study and learn but I was not cut out to be the geography teacher I initially set out to be.
I thoroughly enjoy attending the annual alumni dinners and look forward to the next one.

We are the university that turns words into action and action into change.
That’s why in this strategy, you’ll find a roadmap that invites you to go beyond the page to make real world change that really matters.
From research, to education, to people, this is going to propel us into our second century, and beyond.
All it needs now, is you.
Ready?
We will provide an inspirational and fulfilling education for all, in an empowering, supportive and exciting learning environment.
Aims:
We will create an inclusive and enabling research environment, delivering world-leading research that transforms lives.

By doing this we will be more transparent in our approach, demonstrate integrity, and empower people to make a positive difference.

News
The University of Leicester has cemented its position as a top 15 university for student satisfaction in the National Student Survey (NSS) , the annual survey of students’ experience during their time at university.
According to analysis by The Times the University can celebrate ranking in the top 15 UK institutions.
In its third consecutive year of improvement in the NSS, Leicester has seen positivity improve in all 26 core questions of the survey, with particular increases in positivity for course organisation and management, and student voice.
The 2025 National Student Survey results were published today (9 July).
The NSS asks students across the UK to share their views on their academic support, teaching and assessments, and the wider student experience.
Their feedback will provide information to help prospective students decide where and what to study.
The results also produce rich insights to support universities and colleges to improve the higher education experiences of their students.
This year, more than 2,800 University of Leicester students took part, providing valuable insight into how students perceive their time at the University.
It has seen particularly strong responses in the ‘student voice’ theme, which refers to how well the University listens to students and responds to their feedback, which rose from 79.6% to 81.3%; as well as a rise from 84.2% to 86.2% for the ‘organisation and management’ theme, which recognises efforts by both academic and professional services staff to ensure that the University’s programmes are coherent, consistent and clearly communicated to students.
In the ‘academic support’ theme, reflecting the support of teaching staff during their studies, over 90% of students responded positively.
Three subject areas at Leicester ranked top for overall positivity among the institutions that offer them: Medicine, Human Geography and Earth Sciences.
Three more ranked in the top three in their area: Classics and Languages and area studies were ranked second, while Natural Sciences was ranked third.
A number of subjects were top for a particular theme:
Professor Liz Jones, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) at the University of Leicester, said: “I’m thoroughly delighted to see that more and more students are finishing their studies with a resoundingly positive view of their experience here.
It’s testament to the hard work and dedication of colleagues across the University that we have seen great progress in our NSS performance year after year.
I would like to thank all our staff and our Student’s Union for their valuable contribution, as well as the many students who gave their time to participate in this importance exercise.
“The results of the NSS provide a crucial insight into the experience of our students and how they feel about their education and being part of our community.
While we are celebrating our continued success, we will also reflect on those areas where students are setting the bar higher for us.
“As one of a small number of institutions nationally to achieve TEF Gold alongside a top 30 REF performance, indicating outstanding performance in both teaching and research, we are ideally placed to deliver the very highest quality, most consistent, engaging and well-organised education for our entire student community.”
In the past year, Leicester has been crowned Daily Mail University of the Year 2025 and shortlisted for the Times Higher Education University of the Year 2024 and The Times and The Sunday Times University of The Year 2025 awards.
It ranked =27th position in the 2025 edition of the Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide , 34th in the 2025 Guardian University Guide and last month moved up three places from 36th to =33rd in the Complete University Guide .

The nomination comes hot on the heels of Leicester being crowned Daily Mail University of the Year 2025 , shortlisted for the Times Higher Education University of the Year 2024 award and shooting up 14 places to 34th position in the 2025 Guardian University Guide .
The University has climbed seven places to equal 27th position in this year’s edition of The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide .
A key factor behind the rise was soaring rates of student satisfaction.
The guide’s student experience category saw Leicester shoot up 51 places, while it also rose 40 places in the category which measures students’ feelings about teaching quality.
University of Leicester President and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Nishan Canagarajah, said: “The unprecedented awards and league table success we’ve enjoyed within a single month comes at a time of us also achieving outstanding results in teaching and student satisfaction.
“Leicester has been described as ‘a model university for the 21st century’ based on its academic excellence and inclusive approach.
We are delighted with this further recognition which is testament to the hard work and dedication of the University community.
“Students who are joining us in September can be confident they have made the correct decision, as our student satisfaction rates can confirm.”
Leicester ranks in the top ten in five subject tables: Medicine, Archaeology and Forensic Science, Communication and Media Studies, English and History.
Additionally, it rose 42 places to 44th for Business, Management and Marketing.
The shortlisting adds to Leicester’s growing achievements which include receiving an overall Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) 2023, making it one of a small number of institutions nationally to achieve TEF Gold alongside a top 30 REF performance, indicating outstanding performance in both teaching and research.
In July, the University received the news it was ranked in the top 30 UK institutions of the National Student Survey, clinching 27th place according to analysis by Times Higher Education.
The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025 provides the definitive rankings for UK universities and the most comprehensive overview of higher education in Britain, making use of the latest data*.
It features everything you need to know about applying to university and detailed online profiles for 134 universities covering research reputation to campus facilities, scholarships and bursaries, and nightlife.
Notes:
*The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025 used 2021/22 data for entry standards, firsts and 2:1s, continuation rate and student staff ratio, inclusive of overall satisfaction for all UK universities.
In consultation with the steering group, it was decided not to use this year’s Hesa Data Futures 2022/23 due to deadlines and the fact that the data was an unknown quantity and might be subject to appeals.
The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025 has used NSS 2023 and 2024 data, inclusive of overall satisfaction for all UK universities.
New to the guide this year is a percentage score and ranking from People & Planet which assesses the environmental and ethical standards of each UK university, as well as guides on scholarships and bursaries available at each university and student wellbeing and sports facilities on campus.

New sentences found on https://le.ac.uk/news/2023/december/tef-gold:
The University of Leicester meets the national overall Gold standard for its student experience and outcomes, the highest outcome according to the Government’s scheme that assesses and rates UK universities and colleges for excellence.
The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) 2023, run by the Office for Students (OfS), has awarded the University of Leicester an overall Gold rating, the highest possible award, underpinned by a Gold rating for student outcomes and Silver for student experience.
The ratings, which are awarded by a national TEF panel of independent academic experts and student representatives, are designed to identify excellent undergraduate teaching and student outcomes.
These ratings last for four years from 2023.
For the first time, each higher education provider has been awarded a rating for each ‘aspect’ of the TEF: the student experience and student outcomes.
This gives students more information about where the panel found excellent performance for each university and college.
Leicester’s Gold student outcomes rating reflects outstanding quality in relation to student completion, continuation and progression into graduate employment according to the expert panel, with a range of efforts by staff across the institution working in partnership with students contributing to the University’s successful approach to enhancing outcomes.
The University's sector-leading work on research-inspired education as well as embedding a previously extra-curricular career development programme into all undergraduate programmes were highlighted in particular, as were the very high rates of academic staff with accredited teaching qualifications, which are amongst the highest in the country.
The University’s teaching, feedback and assessment practices are also described as very high quality, with approaches to demystify assessment and inclusion initiatives such as an Inclusive Curriculum Project noted as contributing to a very high-quality student experience.
It follows Leicester’s ranking of 30th in the Times Higher Education’s analysis of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 results , its best-ever performance in a national research assessment exercise, indicating that the University is one of the few in the country to demonstrate excellence in both teaching and research.
Professor Nishan Canagarajah, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leicester, said: “I am really proud that we have been awarded an overall Gold TEF rating – confirming what we know is a really outstanding offering for students.
Our vision is to provide a research-inspired education, and this accolade, alongside our top 30 REF result last year, shows University of Leicester is a world-leading research intensive University.
Our TEF rating is also reflective of the hard work and creativity of our academic and professional services staff who go above and beyond to give all of our students every opportunity to succeed.”
Professor Liz Jones, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Education at the University of Leicester, said: “This is a welcome acknowledgement that our students thrive on the excellent education programmes we offer at Leicester, benefitting from studying in a research-intensive institution that is truly inclusive and diverse.
“We work hard to ensure that our very diverse body of students benefit from an excellent experience with us, leaving us with the expertise and skills they need to become positive Citizens of Change.”
The University’s submission emphasised the inspiring and inclusive environment it provides in which to live, study and work.
Since 2016, £300m has been invested in the student experience estate, and a programme of continual enhancement enriches the education it delivers.
A student-centred ethos lies at the heart of the University’s mission, and successful partnership and co-creation with students have driven sector-leading initiatives like MedRACE that have played an integral role in enhancing the educational experience at Leicester.
MedRACE (Raising Awareness Celebrating Excellence) grew out of the British Medical Association’s ‘Charter for medical schools to prevent and address racial harassment’, establishing a student and staff group to address the four charter principles: supporting individuals to speak out, ensuring robust processes for reporting and handling complaints, mainstreaming EDI across the learning environment and addressing racial harassment on work placements.
Tackling a wide range of student issues, MedRACE has given medical students a voice in their university experience and has embedded racial inclusion in the curriculum to ensure equity and safety.
With Clinical Medicine research at the University of Leicester ranked joint 2nd in the Times Higher Education (THE)’s analysis of the national Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 , Medicine at Leicester has demonstrated that it is leading the sector in both quality and inclusion.
Amardeep Sidki, 4th year intercalating medical student, and Kiran Bhavra, final year medical student, are both MedRACE Student Co-Chairs.
They said: “MedRACE works so effectively because students feel respected by staff members.
This creates a flattened hierarchy in the student-staff group, allowing the lived experiences from the student body to be heard.
As a group, we are constantly inspired by the energy and enthusiasm of our members to step forward, share their experiences and take action to address racial inequality.”
The Leicester Award , an employability programme embedded in all undergraduate courses, was noted for its impact on student outcomes.
It provides students with an opportunity to develop their self-awareness and reflective abilities, principally around their strengths, values, motivations and skills.
The Leicester Award Gold subsequently supports students to identify and prepare a competitive application for a suitable work-related experience.
The vision for Leicester students is a holistic approach in which everyone has employability baked into their studies.
Embedding the Leicester Award into academic content was the first step in the drive to ensure all students are equipped to take advantage of the world of work in the 21st Century.
Rich Wilcock, Head of Student Development, said: “Students are definitely seeing the benefit!
Curricular delivery of the Leicester Award and Leicester Award Gold removes barriers to engagement associated with traditional careers and employability provision.
“Further good news is that our analysis demonstrates that completion of the awards increases the likelihood of our students gaining valuable work experience and developing a sense of career confidence, measures which are proven to improve our students' chances of securing a graduate role or going on to further study.”
Professor Jones adds: “Our consistency in excellent graduate outcomes is one of our key strengths and this, along with our strong National Student Survey scores and student retention rates, has undoubtedly strengthened what we believe is an excellent offering for students.
“With a bold research-inspired Education Strategy already in place, we are in the ideal position to establish the empowering, supportive and exciting learning environment that will usher us into our second century of inspirational and fulfilling education at Leicester.”

The University of Leicester has made one of the biggest climbs of any UK university in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, published on Thursday.
With a ranking of 30 th (Times Higher Education analysis of REF 2021 results), up 23 places from the previous REF in 2014, the University’s result represents its best-ever performance in a national research assessment exercise and recognises the world-changing impact and quality of the research which takes place at Leicester.
Highlights of the REF 2021† include:
†REF rankings are compiled by the Times Higher Education (THE) following analysis of data from Research England.
751 individual Leicester research staff took part in the REF submission, across 22 assessment areas.
The REF 2021 covers the period 2014 to 2020 and, for the first time, included an assessment of all research output from each UK institution.
More than a quarter of Leicester’s 22 units of assessment are among the UK’s top five by overall score.
A total of 157 UK universities were assessed on quality of their research outputs, impact case studies detailing the real-world benefits which their research delivered, and evidence of how the research environment has supported researchers and their research application or impact.
Professor Nishan Canagarajah, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leicester, said: “This inspiring performance is testament to the hard work and dedication of each and every member of Leicester’s research environment.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate them for their role in this great achievement.
“Our REF results are validation of Leicester’s strong heritage in transformative, world-leading research and affirm our place as one of the UK’s top research-intensive universities.
“Now, as we embark on our second Century , I hope to see Leicester researchers continue to serve at the forefront of answering some of our world’s most pressing questions.”
Professor Philip Baker, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Research and Enterprise at the University of Leicester, said: “Leicester’s performance in REF 2021 is another valuable endorsement of the research environment we continue to build here.
“We are enormously proud of our £300m research portfolio, reflecting support from more than 250 major funders, and the diverse range of work across our themes of human health ; heritage and culture ; social justice ; Earth and environment ; space ; and investigations of physical and biological materials .
“We seek to expand and enhance this work through our five new Research Institutes, to be launched later this year, and have been overwhelmed with the response to our call for the next generation of PhD researchers in celebration of the University’s Centenary .”
The REF 2021 assessment found that Leicester’s overall research quality was 42% ‘world-leading’ (4*) and 47% ‘internationally excellent’ (3*) across all submitted areas of research activity.
The assessment included the submission of all staff with significant responsibility for research, meaning the results provide a unique insight into the quality of research conducted across the breadth of universities’ activity.

A University of Leicester postgraduate student developing a concept for a new telescope to study Jupiter has been recognised with a prestigious national award.
Natasha Carr, PhD student in the University’s School of Physics and Astronomy , has received the Florence and Johnstone Stoney Award from the British Federation of Women Graduates (BFWG) in recognition of her work on preparing for X-ray observations in the outer solar system using micro pore X-ray optics.
The award recognises academic excellence for students in the second half of their doctoral study programme and is worth £6,000 to fund her research.
One of BFWG’s main aims is to support women studying in higher education, though they champion all levels of education for women and girls, nationally and internationally.
Doctoral student awards were first made in the early years of the organisation and continue today.
Through its linked charities, the BFWG Scholarship Trust Fund gives awards for doctoral students for academic excellence and Funds for Women Graduates (FfWG), provides postgraduate students with one-off payments in the event of unforeseen financial need.
The award means that Natasha can develop her novel, in-situ X-ray telescope concept, with a focus on the advancement of the optics, to observe Jupiter and potentially other outer planet systems.
It will provide the opportunity to present her concept study and gain feedback on the requirements of such an instrument from some of the world leaders in Jupiter science.
Natasha said: “I am so thankful to my supervisors, Charly Feldman, Simon Lindsay and Adrian Martindale for supporting me through the first half of my PhD and for their constant belief in me.
The award presented to me by the BFWG shows that the wider research community is interested in space science and the chance to continue the long legacy of space research at the University of Leicester is a huge privilege.
“Academia often comes with periods of low confidence and self-doubt, but receiving this academic award has allowed me to build my self-belief, which is more valuable than anything!”
X-rays have been observed from Earth orbit emitted by both Jupiter and its moons, but due to the distance from the planet, the intensity of X-rays observed is low.
This supports the need for in-situ observations.
The Jovian system is host to a unique magnetic environment which generates X-rays through a wide variety of processes.
Observations of these X-rays have been located at the north and south aurorae and equator of Jupiter, the radiation belts and from the surfaces of the moons.
An in-situ telescope using novel ‘lobster eye’ optics could observe X-rays from the different aspects of the Jovian system during approach and in orbit.
The development of Micro Pore Optics (MPOs) has enabled the creation of smaller, lighter X-ray telescopes with wider fields-of-view, when tessellated into a lobster eye arrangement.
This advancement permits an instrument, similar to BepiColombo MIXS or SMILE SXI, to perform in-situ X-ray observations of the systems of the outer planets.
Dr Adrian Martindale, Head of Space Projects and Instrumentation at Space Park Leicester and a Lecturer in Space Instrumentation at the University of Leicester, said: “The University of Leicester is committed to increasing the representation of women and other underrepresented groups in STEM subjects and I am proud that we have talented colleagues like Natasha who make that strategy a reality through their hard work and expertise.
This award will help to kick start Natasha’s career in space instrumentation research, enabling her to attend meetings with the science community who will benefit from her work developing instrumentation for missions to observe Jupiter’s radiation belts.
Congratulations Natasha!”

A new report by leading Leicester academics has called for the Midlands to become a national Living Lab where land is used for multiple purposes to help the UK meet its Net Zero and biodiversity goals.
The land sector must deliver a reduction of 58 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtC02e) by 2050 to meet the Government’s ambition to balance the amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.
Experts from the University of Leicester and Space Park Leicester say multifunctional land management can help the sector achieve these goals, provide food security and sustainable productivity and support community livelihoods and rural economies.
They believe the Midlands’ mix of arable farming, post-industrial land, high biodiversity zones and rapidly growing urban areas offer a natural laboratory to trial integrated land management approaches.
Their report sets out several things that need to happen to achieve this, including the need to deliver training on soil health, biodiversity metric and Earth Observation data supported by knowledge exchange hubs.
Dr Francesca Faedi, who is Academic Liaison for Commercial and Innovation at Space Park Leicester and Space Economy Lecturer at the University of Leicester’s School of Business , said: “I’m thankful for the opportunity to write this briefing paper on Multifunctional Land Use and the importance of Earth Observation data for Government and stakeholders.
“Earth observation data can help us identify productive agricultural land, opportunities for multifunctional benefits and less productive land which could be freed up to meet other needs.
This is why one of the things we’re calling for in this policy briefing is the need to deliver training on Earth Observation data.”
The ‘Accelerating Multifunctional Land Use Policy’ says multifunctional landscapes can help mitigate trade-offs between food production and environmental health.
For instance, introducing agroforestry where trees are integrated into the farming system or buffer zones in arable regions can increase biodiversity by 30 per cent to 50 per cent while maintaining agricultural yields.

Free resources available to help prematurely born children through their school journey
Child development experts at the University are reminding parents and education professionals of free resources aimed at supporting prematurely born children through their school journey.
With the summer holidays coming to an end, many youngsters will be starting school for the first time or returning to a new class and teachers.
Samantha Johnson, developmental psychologist and Professor of Child Development at the University of Leicester hopes to raise awareness and support parents, carers and schools to recognise and meet the needs of children born prematurely whose development and learning may have been impacted by their early birth.
The Preterm Birth Information for Educational Professionals – is a free online training resource developed by Professor Johnson and her colleagues in the PRISM (Premature Infants’ Skills in Mathematics) Study Team.
It outlines the impact premature birth can have on a child’s development and learning and offers practical ways that schools and early years settings can support premature children if they need it.
Professor Johnson said: “It’s that time of the year when schools are gearing up to welcome new cohorts and therefore it’s vitally important they recognise that some children may have additional needs due to their premature birth.
“We know through our research that children born prematurely are more likely to have difficulties with their development and learning than children born at term.
This might be through lower attention and concentration levels, memory and processing difficulties, or difficulty with social and emotional development.
“Early identification and support can make a huge difference to a child’s wellbeing.
Therefore it is vital that teachers and early years practitioners are ready to support prematurely born children and their families.
Our resource is there to support teachers and parents throughout the school journey, starting from the early years.”
Professor Johnson said: “We also strongly encourage schools and early years settings to work towards the Prem Aware Award run by The Smallest Things charity - a scheme which raises awareness of the impact of prematurity and helps school and early years setting to be better prepared to support premature children and their families.”
The Prem Aware Award scheme was launched in 2020 by The Smallest Things Charity.
It aims to raise awareness and support parents, carers and schools to recognise and meet the needs of children born prematurely whose development and learning may have been impacted by their early birth.

An expedition to collect samples of water sealed below the sea floor for potentially thousands of years that University of Leicester scientists played a key role in has completed its offshore phase successfully.
Seventy-four days offshore, 718 cores, 871.83 meters of total core from three locations – this is the first outcome after the end of offshore operations of IODP³-NSF Expedition 501 ‘New England Shelf Hydrogeology’.
The goal of the expedition was to take samples not only of sediment cores, but also of the water stored in sediment, both sandy aquifers and clayey aquitards beneath the ocean floor.
Their existence has been known for decades but they remained virtually unexplored – until now.
The expedition is a joint collaboration between the International Ocean Drilling Programme (IODP³) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF).
For the first time scientists managed to take water and sediment samples from beneath the ocean floor on the New England Shelf with the intention of understanding this offshore aquifer system.
Together with its IODP3 operator partners from the British Geological Survey, MARUM (University of Bremen, Germany), and the University of Montpellier (France), the University of Leicester facilitated this international expedition.
Four geoscientists from the University of Leicester worked in shifts onboard the science vessel, the Liftboat Robert, measuring and studying the physical and chemical properties of solids (e.g.
the sediments) and liquids (e.g.
water).
Professor Sarah Davies, Professor of Sedimentology and lead of the IODP3 group at Leicester, says: “Leicester’s specific expertise and contributions, working in collaboration with colleagues from Montpellier, will be critical in helping to unravel the story behind these groundwater systems.
Our measurements, both on core samples brought back to the surface and directly from the borehole below the seabed, play a key role in this effort.
For example, we can align cores with the borehole using natural gamma ray data, while resistivity measurements are particularly important for this expedition as they relate to the changing interstitial water salinities.
“In addition, we introduced new techniques, including the downhole Borehole Magnetic Resonance measurements to understand porosity and permeability of the sediments.
“This offshore phase of the expedition provided the operations and science teams with new and exciting challenges which ultimately led to a highly successful expedition.
The success is a testament to the dedication, expertise and enthusiasm from an innovative team.
The next expedition phases in the year ahead are going to be full of more new and exciting discoveries.”
Expedition Science Team at the expedition start.
Professor Brandon Dugan, Co-Chief Scientist of the expedition, adds: “We set out with ambitious goals to understand the origin and age of this offshore freshened groundwater system.
It was challenging to operate in difficult drilling environments consisting of loose sand and mud.
Thanks to great teamwork among the IODP3 technical staff, the science team, and the drilling crew, we managed to get great samples including through multiple groundwater pumping tests.
Those tests were a critical to the Expedition and a first for scientific ocean drilling.
And we did it!
Now we have the samples for the science team to really dive into the data and understand the system, which will be helpful for understanding other offshore freshened groundwater systems around the world.”
Fellow Co-Chief Scientist Professor Rebecca Robinson continues: “The pump tests were challenging and required us to adapt our processes to get the best possible samples of the groundwater.
In the end we pumped nearly 50,000 liters of water from nine distinct places, in terms of location and depth below seafloor – a huge success story for something so novel.
For me in particular, as a geochemist not a hydrogeologist, I am so appreciative to everyone that leant their expertise.
Especially the team of hydrogeologists from the British Geological Survey were outstanding.”
Professor Karen Johannesson, the third Co-Chief Scientist, explains: “Some of the groundwaters were remarkably dilute with salinities around and even below 1 psu (practical salinity unit).
To put this into a context that most can understand, 1 psu is the same as 1 gram of total dissolved solids per liter.
Seawater averages about 35 psu.
Groundwaters with total dissolved solids less than 1 psu are fit for human consumption as a drinking water resource, whereas water with around 1 psu are fit for livestock.
The presence of freshened groundwater in sandy, unconsolidated Paleogene and even Cretaceous continental shelf sediments 20 to 50 miles offshore is exciting.
I look forward to discovering how these groundwaters are and what the past climate was like when these groundwaters entered these offshore aquifers.”
During the expedition, the science team rotated on and off the Liftboat Robert transported by helicopter or supply vessel.
The entire science team will meet for the onshore operations at the Bremen Core Repository, at MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen (Germany) in January and February 2026 to split, sample, and analyze the sediment cores and water collected.
The cores will be archived and made accessible for further scientific research for the scientific community after a one year-moratorium period.
All expedition data will be open access in the IODP³ MSP data portal in the PANGAEA database, and resulting outcomes will be published.

The University of Leicester’s Accessibility statement is a live document, providing an open account of our current position.
This statement applies to all content available on the le.ac.uk domain and suppliers/third parties including jobs.le.ac.uk.
Our websites (including le.ac.uk) and Digital Learning Environment (DLE) are run by the
University of Leicester.
The largest part of our DLE is our Virtual Learning Environment (VLE);
a service provided by Blackboard.
We are currently using Blackboard Learn SaaS.
We have adopted Blackboard Ultra which provides more built-in accessibility features than the previous version.
Our VLE contains the majority of our learning and teaching resources and activities and has a
user community of 6,046 people who can create content (as of March 2025).
There are over 20,407 Blackboard course sites provided for teaching, containing over two million content items.
We want as many people as possible to be able to use these websites.
For example, that means you
should be able to:
We work with our suppliers to review the accessibility of third party content on our website and in our VLE and phase out their use where these are inaccessible.
We make assessments when the supplier contracts are up for renewal, and check third party content for accessibility at that time.
The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
For example, we do not plan to update teaching materials created for use in course delivery prior to 23 September 2018.
We strive to ensure new content we publish meets accessibility standards; however, there are still significant numbers of content items in our VLE that are non-compliant.
Using an estimate of five minutes per correction, this amounts to 8,568 person hours to correct every item of live VLE content to meet current accessibility legislation.
To address this, we will include clear instructions in our VLE courses for how students can request accessible formats if needed.
We provide regular training and guidance for staff on how to create accessible content and generate annual Blackboard Ally accessibility reports for each school and department highlighting priority areas to address.
We will review the accessibility of VLE materials annually to ensure they are continuing to improve.
We use Panopto to create and share recorded learning materials.
Panopto provides good quality captions through automated speech recognition.
Although, as with any automated system, they are not 100% accurate.
Following analysis of the number of hours recorded, and experience from other institutions of the time required to manually correct captions, we estimate it would take 76,225 person hours to edit the captions to ‘human levels’ of accuracy.
To mitigate the fact that captions will not be 100% accurate, we are providing guidance for staff on how to optimise the quality of captions in their recordings.
Staff will direct students to alternative, text-based sources of information in cases where the captions are not of sufficiently good quality.
We are establishing a process for students to report problems experienced when using recordings because the captions are not adequate.
In addition, we will continue working with Panopto to improve quality over time.
We have established a process for staff to request more accurate, paid for captions where funding is available.
We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
Given this position the University considers this area of content as a disproportionate burden to maintain to WCAG standards (WCAG 3.1.1).
We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations .
We use a reCAPTCHA service on jobs.le.ac.uk in order to protect the website from spam and abuse whilst letting valid users use the site.
This is a vital security tool that prevents automated software from engaging with the site.
A specific language has not been detailed within the reCAPTCHA software which may mean that some assistive technologies are less accurate.
Whilst the reCAPTCHA software is used on jobs.le.ac.uk, it is owned by an alternative third party provider and we are unable to make this change to satisfy the WCAG standard (WCAG 3.1.1) without introducing a significant security risk.

Developed and taught by our School of Healthcare, the Master of Optometry (MOptom) degree is a gateway to a rewarding career as a registered optometrist.
Optometrists work on the frontline of healthcare, playing a critical role in maintaining and improving the eye health of people of all ages and backgrounds.
Optometrists work in a variety of settings, including in hospitals and on the high street.
They carry out detailed eye examinations, prescribe glasses or contact lenses and, through their use of advanced technology and deep clinical knowledge, they also detect and manage defects in vision or disease.
This course is undergoing accreditation by the General Optical Council (GOC).
This means that, following successful approval of the programme, once you graduate, you can become a registered optometrist.
On this degree, you will develop your knowledge and skills through a mix of academic study and work- and clinic-based learning.
You will be taught by expert practitioners, and you will benefit from our outstanding clinical facilities at Leicester Royal infirmary and optic labs on campus, as well as pioneering and highly specialist facilities such as our medical dissection rooms and Space Park Leicester.
Preparing you for your professional career life is a fundamental aspect of this course, which has been designed in close collaboration with the professional optometry sector.
We believe that gaining practical, real-world experience is one of the best ways to develop the professional competencies demanded of an optometrist.

This includes business models, practice management and clinical law.
In your final year, you will undertake a year-long College of Optometrists Clinical Learning in Practice (CLiP) module, in addition to a Professional Certificate in Glaucoma (ProfCert Glauc), with a single employer.
This allows you to implement your clinical learning into routine practice and build on your experience at university instead of doing a separate pre-registration year.

These vaccinations are a requisite for students to successfully complete their course.
Students that do not engage with the relevant immunisation programmes and do not have the required vaccinations will not be able to participate in their clinical placements.

Unlike some universities, where every room is identical to the one next door, the rooms at Leicester vary considerably in size and shape.
(Especially among The Village heritage properties where you could be in a spacious Edwardian bedroom with wood-panelled walls!)
We have six basic types of room - every room has a bed, a wardrobe, a desk and chair, storage, and wifi.
This is a regular room with the standard features listed above.
You share a bathroom and kitchen with your neighbours.
This is the same as a Single Bedroom except...
well, the clue's in the name - it has a washbasin.
This type of room has its own private bathroom with a toilet, basin and shower.
So a bit more privacy - but it's your responsibility to keep it clean.
You share a kitchen with your neighbours.
This is fully self-contained.
You have an ensuite bathroom, as above, and kitchen facilities in your room.
This is fully self-contained with a bit more space.
You have a bedroom, a bathroom and a separate living room/kitchen.
You're living the dream!
We also have a very small number of Twin Bedrooms, which are our cheapest rooms.
Like a standard Single Room, you'll each have your own bed, a wardrobe, a desk and chair, and storage and you'll share a kitchen and bathroom with your neighbours.
The difference is: you get a roomy!
(There are 20 of these, so 40 beds available).
Not all properties have all room types, of course.
And while, in general, prices increase with the facilities in your room, the varied nature of our properties means that the price for any room type differs between buildings.
Please see the relevant page for each property to find out what rooms are available there and how much they cost.
How many people share a kitchen or bathroom depends on the overall layout of the property.
Kitchens are shared between four or more students, bathrooms between three or more.
You'll see some rooms listed as 'room type (small)' or 'room type (large)' and these are naturally either cheaper or more expensive than regular rooms.
Please note that this indicates the room is different in size to other rooms of that type in that particular property group.
'Small' and 'large' do not indicate specific sizes.
Adapted rooms (Single with Washbasin, Single Ensuite or Studio Flat) are available in Bowder Court , Southmeade Court and The Pavillions (The Village) and Nixon Court Blocks A-E (The City).
These have optional seating, grab rails and flat entry.
The ensuites and flats have an adapted bathroom with a shower.
The flats also have adapted kitchens designed for wheelchair users.

Wireless sensor networks are a new technology with a wide range of applications (from environment monitoring to surveillance) but subject to a number of energy constraints, many-to-one flows, and redundant low-rate data.
Many routing protocols have been proposed for sensor networks that aim at achieving energy efficiency, but with little or no attention to robustness and fault-tolerance.
This project addressed fault tolerance in ad-hoc sensor network routing, namely the design and development of a robust and energy efficient routing protocol that distinguishes between local and large-scale traffic.
A new multipath routing protocol was proposed and simulated which follows the 'number of hops' metric and employs a waiting time before transmitting messages to sink.
SRML is the Reference Modelling Language of the European project SENSORIA.
It provides primitives for modelling and reasoning about business processes in a way that is independent of the languages used for executing them.
This project developed a tool for generating SRML models from two specific industry standards: The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), which is used for specifying business process based on Web Services, and the Web Services Description Languages (WSDL) – an XML format for describing network services.
The encoding provides the means to create high-level declarative descriptions of BPEL/WSDL specifications that can be used for building more complex business process models that can include components specified in other languages.
Many people in industry and academia use a document typesetting system called LaTeX.
Documents may be published in various formats including reports, journal articles, conference proceedings, authored books, and so on.
BibTeX is the tool used by LaTeX for formatting lists of references that are to be incorporated within these documents.
Although it is very effective, BibTeX has raised a practical concern due to its low level of abstraction, making it difficult to share bibliographic information among tools or people executing different activities (for instance, between the technical and the marketing staff within a company).

Leicester Medical School is highly rated, so competition for places is keen and we expect high grades in appropriate A-levels (or equivalent).
Your UCAS form should detail all of your academic qualifications (achieved and pending), first sit results if any are resits, a current academic reference (mandatory) and a personal statement, plus details of any employment.
Although not routinely read, your personal statement may be assessed in some situations and so should be clear and concise.
It should outline your ambitions and experiences, and how they have shaped your personal development.
Medical work experience is not essential but you should be able to demonstrate that you have undertaken some kind of work where you are able to communicate with the public.
All academic attainment listed on UCAS must match the certificates we will ask for at interview; otherwise, academic scores will be revised, and interview status may be revoked.
Incomplete UCAS forms will be rejected.
If you do not have formal qualifications at year 10/11 i.e.
GCSE equivalents, you must send in school transcripts to med-admis@le.ac.uk before 15 October.
We will not chase applicants for this information.
It is the applicant’s responsibility to supply it.

The MMIs will last about an hour and you will be assessed through a number of stations some of which include communication, motivation, empathy, and comprehension.
We expect to offer face to face interviews for home students and online interviews only for international candidates for the current cycle.
Prior to interview you will be asked to complete a consent form and upload your academic certificates to a student portal.
Please make sure you have read all the information sent to you ahead of time so that you do not miss this important step.
If you are usually entitled to extra time or other adjustments in examinations please notify us as soon as possible, and supply supporting information, as we may be able to make reasonable adjustments to the interview.

All offers are based on occupational health and DBS clearance (information regarding these will be sent to you around confirmation).
Some candidates will be required to have a formal occupational health assessment, which will be made a condition of their offer (see below).
Should you meet all the conditions of your offer your place will be confirmed.
You will then be sent details, usually after A level results day, about the occupational health screen, DBS check, and be asked to agree to the annual Medical School agreement (PDF, 291kb) .
You may find it useful to review the current version of this document prior to your online registration but please note this Agreement is revised every year, so this version may differ from the one you are asked to sign on registration.
Due to strict caps on numbers enforced by the Office for Students we are only allowed a maximum of 18 international students each intake.
Consequently, in recent years competition for international places has been higher than for home places.
If a candidate applies as a home student, and it then transpires they will be international at the point of registration their offer will be void.
Applicants who will receive Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) within the admissions cycle (eg apply in October 2025 without ILR but register in September 2026 with ILR) will be considered as home students.
Otherwise, they will be assessed as international.
We recommend delaying application if your ILR will be received after registration.

More application information
Please note: we do not know what score will be required to be invited to interview as it depends on the quantity and quality of applications we receive.
In addition, due to changes in the total UCAT score for 2025 test takers, we have had to revise our scoring system to retain a 50:50 split academic:UCAT.
In considering your application, we will calculate a score for your academic ability, based on your UCAS form, or transcripts if you have submitted those in lieu of formal examinations.
Applicants with predicted A-levels
Applicants with predicted A-levels (or equivalent qualifications) will be scored on 8 GCSE qualifications.
Applicants with achieved A-levels
Please see scoring document for full information.
Applicants with a predicted or achieved degree
Applicants with a predicted or achieved degree will be scored on 3 A-levels and their degree
prediction or achieved classification.
Your academic score will be combined with a score based on your UCAT results.
Your combined score will determine whether you are invited for interview.
In order to distinguish between 'borderline' applicants, we may also take into account your 'personal qualities' based on your personal statement and reference, and contextual flags: please see widening access section .
Because applications are ranked, there is no set score which guarantees an interview.
The threshold will depend on the quality and quantity of applications we receive.
We reserve the right to change our scoring systems at any time in order to rank applicants appropriately.
Before applying for a medical degree at Leicester Medical School you must take the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) .
This helps us to make a more informed choice from amongst the many highly-qualified applicants to our medical school, ensuring that the candidates we select have the appropriate mental abilities, attitudes and professional behaviour required for new doctors to be successful in their clinical careers.
The UCAT does not contain any curriculum or science content.
The test is run by the UCAT Consortium in partnership with Pearson VUE, a global leader in computer-based testing and part
of Pearson plc.
It is delivered on computers worldwide through Pearson VUE's high street centres.
Significant issues arising during the testing are reported to us through annotations and we will consider these when scoring an application.
We do not usually consider mitigating circumstances for UCAT.
We do not have a minimum UCAT score as such but it forms a significant part of our selection for interview.
Those with a score in the lowest 2 deciles are very unlikely to score sufficiently to get invited to interview.
Please browse our scoring criteria for the MBChB and the MBChB with Foundation Year above.
Please note: applicants with band 4 in the Situational Judgement Test will be automatically rejected pre-interview.
If you are normally entitled to additional time for exams based upon a medical diagnosis or report from a specialist teacher, you
are entitled to sit the UCATSEN (University Clinical Aptitude Test - Special Educational Needs).
Relevant conditions include (but are not limited to) dyslexia, dyspraxia, dysgraphia, dysorthographia, attention deficit disorder or working memory deficit.
Please refer to the Access Arrangements information on the UCAT website if you believe this may apply to you.
The dates of interviews for the 2026 entry cycle are as follows:
Home students (Face to Face at George Davies Centre):
International students (Online):
Please note: If applicants cannot attend any of the interview dates offered then please do contact us immediately.
However, we may not be able to offer any alternative dates, nor be able to reschedule.
We reserve the right to alter our interview dates, or the format of the interview, if other circumstances necessitate this.
We will begin sending out sending out batches of interview invitations in late November.
These are sent by email.
Emails will be sent from medoffice@le.ac.uk - please check that our emails are not arriving in your junk mail folder (especially if you have a Gmail account).
For 2026 entry our interviews will be to face-to-face for our Home fee status applicants, but online for our International fee status applicants (see fee status section above).
We use the multiple mini-interview (MMI) style - consisting of a number of individual mini-interviews (or 'stations') which will assess your:
Motivation to study medicine and genuine interest in the medical profession
Each station will be scored and you will be ranked on the basis of the total scores.
Where two or more applicants are equally ranked,
all aspects of your application may be used as a tie-breaker.
We regularly review our interview process and hence do not endorse and cannot recommend any interview courses.
After your interview, each of your stations will be scored and you will be ranked on the basis of the total scores.
Your UCAS form including personal statement and reference, and consent form including health declaration and criminal record, will be reviewed at this stage by our selectors.
On the basis of the thorough consideration of these, one of three decisions will be made:
We will endeavour to send out decisions as soon as possible following interview, but please be mindful that since offer holders can only make decisions once they have all their options, the timing of offers can vary from early January to mid-May.
If you do not hear from us immediately after your interview, this does not necessarily mean you have been rejected.
We will be holding offer holder days in March and April.
Please note that the following information applies to 2026 entry.
We review our policy annually.
Please see below for information regarding resits.
We aim to be as inclusive as possible and, therefore, will give due consideration to substantial mitigating circumstances that may have affected your academic achievement.
Please view our mitigating circumstances guide , which applies primarily to our current students but also provides a definition of mitigation and depicts the kind of unusual circumstances which may constitute special consideration.
Possible circumstances may include (but are not limited to) the following:
It is essential that you submit mitigating circumstances as soon as possible if you believe that your academic achievement has been affected by any of the above, as we may be able take these issues into account when assessing your application.
However, we will not accept academic qualifications below our minimum requirement.
Accepted mitigation may mean we consider resits, or award bonus academic points (maximum 2).
You can apply by completing our mitigating circumstances form and sending any supporting evidence to medadmis@le.ac.uk with the email subject: 'Mitigating Circumstances Evidence - SURNAME_Firstname' e.g.
Mitigating Circumstances Evidence - SMITH_John
Please note : In order for mitigation to be considered, an official letter must be provided by the relevant professional (school/college/university/health consultant/GP) to corroborate such circumstances.
This letter should include the applicant’s full name and UCAS number.
It should be printed on letter-headed paper, signed and dated.
This should be submitted via email preferably with your UCAS number.
The evidence must explain:
All mitigation and supporting documents must be received by 1 October in the year of application.
If we do not receive mitigation by this date then it will not be considered and the scoring of the application will be carried out on the basis of no mitigation.
If mitigation is received by 1 September in the year of application we will give you a definitive response as to whether we will or will not accept the mitigation before the closing date for applications.
No decision on mitigation will be given via the telephone.
We do not usually consider mitigation for the UCAT test, but will consider this on an individual basis.
UCAT does inform us of any issues that arise during the test, and significant annotations will be taken into account.
Please note that we will not accept GCSE results below our minimum requirements:
Grade B/6 (A100) or 5/C (A199) in English Language, Mathematics and Chemistry/Biology or Double Science even if you
have mitigation.
However, we may accept re-sits in some cases, as described above.
English Language and Maths can be resat once without mitigation but resits in any Science subject will only be considered if
there has been prior agreement from the admissions tutor.
To gain prior agreement you must complete the form and send in supporting evidence as details above.
First sit and resit grades must be declared on your UCAS form.
Please note that we will only accept GCSE resits where the results have been received at the point of application.
We cannot consider pending GCSE results, even with a predicted grade.
Year 12 resits (first sit of A-levels after 3 years)
Candidates who for significant health or social reasons have taken 3 years to sit their A-levels for the first time will be considered, but this will have to have been formally agreed by the admissions tutors ahead of application (see above).
A-level resits
Applicants who had not attained the required grades at first sit, will only be considered with resits if they were holding a conditional firm offer with us, and there was substantial mitigation that has been previously agreed by the admissions tutor (see above).
We encourage applications from candidates with disabilities.
All applications will be considered according to the University's equal opportunities policy and taking into account the advisory guidelines in the welcomed and valued published by the General Medical Council.
The Medical School will endeavour to make reasonable adjustments for candidates with disabilities.
However, it must ensure that all candidates will be able meet the core learning outcomes and competencies of the course, and be able to practice as a doctor on completion of the course.
The GMC mandates that in order to be conferred a medical degree, and be registered by the GMC on course completion, doctors must be able to perform a number of mandatory practical procedures outlined in the GMC's document outcomes for graduates (PDF, 450kb) .
Candidates should be assured that their application and interview performance will be scored without regard to disability or specific learning difficulties.
However, we advise candidates with a disability to inform the Medical School as soon as possible when invited to interview so that reasonable adjustments for multiple mini interview stations can be discussed.
If you have a health issue, disability or learning difficulty which has not been declared on your UCAS form, please contact the Medical School in writing.
All information will be treated in the strictest confidence.
Some candidates will be asked to have a formal Occupational Health assessment as a condition of their offer.
Although this is to ensure they are fit enough to start the course, it is mainly to see what reasonable adjustments should be made on the course; and to inform them of the support services available both as a student and as a doctor in training.
In the very rare situation where, following an Occupation Health assessment, the Medical School are concerned that an applicant may not be able to meet the core learning outcomes and competencies, the admissions tutors will refer the case to a Fitness to Practise panel who will make a decision, independently from the admissions process.
The University of Leicester has extensive learning support facilities .
If you have any concerns or queries please contact us .
Further information regarding Occupational Health standards for Medical Students can be found on the Higher Education Occupational Practitioners website .
For Access Leicester: Medicine or other UKWPMED progression programme : We will guarantee you an interview, provided you meet our minimum GCSE requirements (at first-sit); are predicted or have achieved (first gap year only) at least ABB in our required subjects without resits; successfully completed the progression programme; and have a UCAT in the top 7 deciles with a SJT 1-3.
The A must be in Chemistry or Biology.
Please state UKWPMED in the ‘Activities in preparation for Higher Education’ section on your UCAS form.
For Realising Opportunities Programme : We will guarantee you an interview, provided you meet our minimum GCSE requirements (at first-sit); are predicted or have achieved (first gap year only) at least AAA in our required subjects without resits; successfully completed the progression programme; and have a UCAT in the top 7 deciles with a SJT 1-3.
Please state Realising Opportunities Programme in the ‘Activities in preparation for Higher Education’ section on your UCAS form.
When selecting for interview for our A100 5 year course, we score applications on academic qualifications and UCAT (see our scoring document).
The top scoring applicants are invited to interview without regard to their background or the school they attended.
For those in the borderline group, all aspects of the application are assessed including the personal statement and reference.
We also look for a number of contextual markers (see scoring document).
An applicant with two or more contextual markers may be advantaged at this stage over another applicant with the same score and no, or fewer, contextual markers.
These markers include students in receipt of the UCAT bursary; students who attended a secondary school where the Key Stage 4 (GCSE) performance is lower than the national average (based on Attainment 8); students who live in an area with low participation in higher education (those living in IMD quintile 1 or 2); students in receipt of free school meals for over 6 months; students in receipt of the 16-19 bursary; students who have spent 3 months or more in local authority care; students with refugee status.
Following interview, contextual offers will be made to those who have completed a UKWPMED programme (contextual offer of ABB), or a Realising Opportunities Programme (AAA).
In addition, anyone from IMD 1 who either receives the UCAT or 16-19 bursary, OR free school meals for more than 6 months OR was in care for more than 3 months will receive a contextual offer of AAA.
Find out more about the approaches Leicester Medical School is taking to widen access to medical school from under-represented groups and students whose background may have prevented them from achieving their full potential.
Statistics for admission to the A100 Medicine MBChB course and A199 Medicine with Foundation Year MBChB course at Leicester Medical School.
Please note that for A100, the academic scoring system was adjusted for 2024 and 2025 entry and therefore the scores required to secure an A100 interview in 2023 and earlier years are not relevant.
Similarly, for 2026 entry due to the UCAT total score changes the scoring for A100 will be substantially different, and so previous total scores required to get to interview are again irrelevant.

The University of Leicester has been crowned the Daily Mail University of the Year 2025.
Judges were particularly impressed by the University’s social mobility initiatives, which include programmes for students from underrepresented backgrounds to support their progression into higher education.
Leicester also scored highly for teaching quality, student experience, research excellence, graduate outcomes and social inclusion.
The result follows a string of successes for the East Midlands university.
In the past year, Leicester received an overall Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) 2023, making it one of a small number of institutions nationally to achieve TEF Gold alongside a top 30 REF performance , indicating outstanding performance in both teaching and research.
In July, the University received the news it was ranked in the top 30 UK institutions of the National Student Survey , clinching 27th place according to analysis by the Times Higher Education.
The University’s Stoneygate Centre for Empathic Healthcare also caught the imagination of the Daily Mail’s judging panel.
The centre’s mission is to improve patients’ lives by pioneering a robust new approach to medical education and training for junior doctors that positions empathy at the heart of healthcare.
The judges also liked the Citizens of Change Scholarship , which challenges students to articulate in 60 seconds one thing they’d change in the world.
Successful scholars can receive up to £15,000 over three years.
Alastair McCall, Editor, Daily Mail University Guide , said: “Leicester is a model university for the 21st century and one of the best catches in British higher education, providing an outstanding university education in return for eminently attainable A-level grades.
“This is an institution not afraid to innovate – DNA fingerprinting was discovered here by Prof Sir Alec Jeffreys 40 years ago – and the university seeks out the next generation of changemakers through its imaginative Citizens of Change scholarships, which challenge applicants to make a 60-second video about the one thing they would change in the world.
Lucrative scholarships reward the best submissions.
“Putting empathy at the heart of medical education and training within its excellent medical school is just the latest example of how the university works to make the world a better place, turning out graduates able to make an impact on the world rather than simply take their place within it.
“The ethnic and social diversity on campus reflects the city in which the university is located, and the university works hard to provide its distinctive higher education to everyone who would benefit from it.
There are no obvious weaknesses in our University of the Year: strong in teaching, strong in research, socially diverse and reflective of modern Britain, and with a good graduate employment record.
“Leicester was once one of the better kept secrets of British higher education.
No longer.
The growing number of applicants is testimony to Leicester’s ability to cut through in a competitive marketplace; the university’s dynamic graduates are evidence of the university’s ability to make a difference.”
University of Leicester President and Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Nishan Canagarajah, said: “The legacy of Leicester is that it is founded on a spirit of hope – to use the power of higher education to benefit others.
It is therefore with gratitude that we accept this honour of being the University of the Year.
“As an international university in Britain’s most diverse city, we are a University for inclusion.
We remain true to our values of being inspiring, impactful and inclusive while holding fast to our founding principles with humanity and hope.”
The Daily Mail ranking , first published last year, is the broadest-based ranking of UK universities.
It is made up of 12 performance indicators covering student satisfaction with teaching quality, support and their wider university experience, graduate jobs outcomes and salaries, research quality and income, degree outcomes, student progression, entry standards and – uniquely – a measure of universities’ commitment to social mobility, measured through the proportion of first-generation students registered.
The ranking features 129 universities.
The guide is edited and compiled by Alastair McCall, who has been compiling and editing university guides annually since 1998, first for The Sunday Times, and now for the Daily Mail.
Leicester ranks 29th= in the new edition of the guide, a rise of three places from last year.
Based on outcomes from this year’s National Student Survey (NSS), Leicester ranks 8th for student experience under a Daily Mail analysis of the results, its strongest performing area in the NSS.
The university scores heavily, too, for research.
Using results from the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Leicester ranks 29th for the quality and quantity of research and 21st in the UK for research income per head of research staff.
Average early career graduate salaries of £29,000 rank the university 28th=, while the 83% of students who leave with a first class or 2:1 degree places Leicester 37th=.
With just under 40% of students the first in their immediate family to go to university, the university ranks 84th= in the UK for social mobility.
However, among the 28 universities ranked higher than Leicester in the table overall, just five have a better record for social mobility.

If you can analyse the problem with a clear head, suggest a range of possible solutions, and then effectively judge the best path to take, your employer will know they have the right person on the job.
Assuming you’re not an octopus, you can’t do everything at once.
Do you work uninterrupted on the main task, or park it to deal with quick fixes.

Additional support within the University
SafeZone is a safety app which the University of Leicester is making available to all staff and students.
The app allows you to alert University Security via your mobile phone if you ever need urgent assistance or first aid, or if you have an emergency while on campus.
The system is privacy-protected, so will never share your location unless you summon assistance or if you use the check-in function.
This also means the app will not drain your mobile phone battery.
SafeZone is simple-to-use and free to download:
Once you have downloaded the SafeZone app you need to sign up using your University email.
SafeZone has three main buttons that can be used to request assistance from Security:
If a button is pressed in error, the alert can be cancelled by tapping the button again, whilst the timer is winding down.
SafeZone uses high-speed push messaging to allow Security to send you important notifications in the case of an emergency or critical incident on campus.
The check-in function allows you to let Security know where you are if you are working alone or outside of normal working hours.
SafeZone does not track your location.
You only become visible on the system once you have raised an alert or checked in.

We always stayed in fairly regular contact.
I was still nervous about bringing stuff up with him, but he was just amazing.
He gave me all the time I could want.
He showed me some specific resources that directly applied to situations I was in.
He contacted my teachers to get mitigating circumstances and comprehensively went through options.
Ultimately, I'm now here in a much better place than I was a few months ago with a degree, with a place on a teaching course.
It genuinely wouldn't have been possible without contact with my tutor, so I can't recommend it enough.”
“During the second semester, I had some employment commitments that clashed with a lecture.
My tutor was very approachable, so I had no qualms discussing my issues with him.
The discussion with my tutor built trust with me and other senior members of staff.

We recognise that forced displacement creates significant barriers to accessing higher education.
These DL Sanctuary Awards therefore offer opportunities for those who have been forcibly displaced from their homes and/or who are at risk of political persecution, violence or conflict anywhere in the world to study with the University of Leicester part-time via distance learning.
Applicants can be based anywhere in the world as long as there is regular access to the internet.
We welcome applications from those living outside the UK and will determine eligibility on a case by case basis.
The Award provides a full fee waiver only (it cannot cover the cost of optional campus-based activities).
You can choose the part-time version of any of the following distance learning Master’s programmes:
You can apply for a DL Sanctuary Award if you hold an academic offer to study (or are waiting for a decision) and have at any time been forcibly displaced from your home and forced to seek sanctuary elsewhere.
Eligible applicants may be based anywhere in the world and be refugees, people seeking asylum and people who have been internally displaced and/or who are at risk of political persecution, violence or conflict.
If you have a background of forced displacement and believe you are eligible, please apply, and we will consider your application on a case-by-case basis.
You may have always aspired to study at university but faced obstacles in achieving your goal.
We understand that your studies may have been interrupted, that you might not have evidence of your previous qualifications or that your qualifications aren't transferable.

The DL Sanctuary Award is designed to accommodate these factors, so don’t let these stop you from applying.
Please note that we prioritise those applicants with the greatest need, and who are facing the greatest barriers to continuing their education.
For example, if you are in the UK and able to access Student Finance, we would not prioritise your application.
Please use your personal statement to fully outline these barriers.
In your supporting statement please include your response to the following prompts:
When you apply for your degree course, if you are unable to provide evidence of your previous education or professional experience please use your personal statement to tell us as much about your previous education or work experience as you can.

If your offer is not unconditional by the time of the panel, we will not be able to consider your application at that panel but we encourage you to re-apply if/when your offer is made unconditional.
It will then be considered at a future panel.

Project:
TNBC represents 15-20% of all breast cancers and is the most aggressive subtype [1,2].
TNBC lacks hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), resulting in the absence of effective targeted therapies.
Chemotherapy has been the primary treatment until the recent introduction of immunotherapy /oncology (IO) [3-6].
Consequently, metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) patients have limited treatment options and worse overall survival.
Reliable biomarkers for prognosis and treatment monitoring are lacking [2, 7], highlighting a clear unmet need.
While new treatment like chemo-immunotherapy (chemo-IO) have improved outcomes, development of drug resistance remains a significant issue.
Liquid biopsies (LB) offer an attractive alternative approach for disease monitoring, with circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) the current ‘cornerstones’ of LB analysis [8,9].
Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) mutation analysis often fails to detect resistance early due to low abundance, however CTCs, which are responsible for cancer metastasis, have shown promise in determining treatment resistance and guiding treatment.
As aberrations are tumour-specific and reflect disease progression [10-12], epigenetic analysis of cfDNA and CTC transcriptomics are two attractive alternative analytes to explore metastatic progression through liquid biopsy analytes.
This project aims integrate epigenetic profiling of plasma-derived cfDNA and transcriptomic analysis of CTCs to identify robust biomarkers of disease progression and therapy resistance.
The student will receive interdisciplinary training include microfluidic liquid biopsy workflows for CTC isolation, CTC transcriptomics techniques, whole-genome methylation sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), bioinformatics, biostatistics, machine learning for muti-omics integration (eg.
Seurat DESeq2, Random Forest/SVM), scientific writing, data visualisation and presentation skills.

Applications are sought from talented and motivated UK candidates with an academic background in chemistry or material science.
Experience with batteries or electrochemistry would be an advantage but is not essential.
Project Description:
In 2025, in the UK alone, a stockpile of ca.
70,000-106,000 units of obsolete end-of-first-life EV batteries are waiting to be recycled.
The challenge posing across the entire industry is how to recycle and remanufacture EV cells without destructive recovery of precious metals via legacy processes such as pyro/hydrometallurgy, which are the current industry standards.
A recent Leicester-developed and patent-pending technology demonstrated success in separation of black mass from different sources into highly pure cathode and anode components using ultrasound-generated vegetable oil-in-water nano emulsions.[1] The process takes minutes and enables short-loop recycling of LIBs without altering the original battery crystalline structure.
This is the ideal method to reprocess battery production scraps to allow active materials to be directly recast into another cell.
However, research questions remain.
In this work, in collaboration with a major automotive OEM, you will develop the novel separation techniques using chemical knowledge, benchmarked short-loop remanufactured cells against pristine cells from which the materials were recovered from and further develop this technology for real-world battery production scraps.
You will learn technoeconomic and life-cycle analysis to be able to benchmark the work against the legacy technology.
There will be an opportunity to carry out placement studies with a major automotive OEM.
Key Funding and Benefits:
The successful candidate will gain expertise in:
This PhD studentship offers a unique opportunity to contribute to one of the most pressing challenges in the electrification of transport, applying cutting-edge green chemistry to real-world industrial needs.

Project Description
Background : Empathic healthcare improves patient safety, 1 quality of life, and satisfaction with their care while reducing pain 2,3 and mortality.
4 Empathy can also reduce practitioner burnout.
5,6 In parallel, artificially intelligent (AI) care- and chat-bots are increasingly playing patient-facing roles in healthcare.
There are concerns regarding how empathic these AI care- and chat-bots can provide empathic (and therefore, effective and safe) care.
To address this, the Stoneygate Centre for Empathic Healthcare are seeking to ensure that AI care- and chat-bots provide empathic healthcare, while simultaneously ensuring that healthcare practitioners retain their human advantages.
Please note: While hosted in a medical school, this is not a medical education project per se .
The PhD candidates will focus on the research to underpin an evidence-based curriculum.
Aim : To develop, deliver, and evaluate AI (or AI-informed) empathy interventions for healthcare students and practitioners.
Research questions & how answering them will contribute to wider knowledge.
Can artificially intelligent care- and chat-bots be as empathic as human practitioners (and can they leverage the benefits of empathic care for patients)?
Like it or not, care- and chat-bots are increasingly being used for patient care, even at times replacing human beings.
These new technologies have not been evaluated so the extent to which they can be empathic (and thus generate the positive patient benefits of empathic care) is not known.
Can virtual reality be used to train healthcare practitioners and medical students to enhance how they express empathy?
Virtual reality (VR) training devices are being used and developed at a very fast pace.
We do not know the relative benefits and risks of VR training for healthcare practitioners compared with training from real human trainers.
Methods : The methods will be tailored to the research question, and will include:
The Stoneygate Team has international expertise and can supervise students who use any of the above methods.
Anticipated outputs and impact : The Stoneygate Centre for Empathic Healthcare has connections with medical schools and professional bodies within the UK and abroad, so this doctoral research will have a measurable and important positive impact on both patients and practitioners.
Under the directorship of Professor Jeremy Howick, Dr Amber Bennett-Weston, and Professor Simon Gay the doctoral student will produce multiple publications per year.
Funding will be provided by the Stoneygate Trust for 3 years.
The studentship provides:
Applicants are required to hold/or expect to obtain a UK Bachelor Degree 2:1 or better in a relevant subject.
The University of Leicester English language requirements apply where applicable.

MRC AIM is a Doctoral Training Programme (DTP) funded by the MRC between three academic partners – Universities of Birmingham, Leicester, and Nottingham.
The research projects that PhD students within AIM undertake use cutting-edge, inter-disciplinary research methods to create and interrogate innovative models of disease.
As part of the partnership, AIM PhD students work with complex data, cell-based models, model organisms and patients to better understand areas of clinical need such as metabolic and infectious diseases, cancer, chronic inflammatory conditions and respiratory disease, and psychological disorders.
Available training is likely to include the following although this is not a comprehensive list and is subject to change:
A PhD opens the door for a range of research-related careers in both academic and industry settings.
The DTP offers PhD projects that are co-led by academic/industry collaborations (iCASE studentships) as well as opportunities for students to undertake placements that give them a taste of working in the biomedical industry sector.
We have a close relationship with two pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca and UCBPharma, who will provide all DTP students with valuable knowledge and insight into the sector, as well as ensuring that our comprehensive training programme equips our students with the necessary skills for a career outside of academia.

The University of Leicester and Colchester+Ipswich Museums Service are pleased to announce a fully-funded Collaborative Doctoral Studentship, from October 2025, under the AHRC’s Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Scheme .
This project will be jointly supervised by Dr Philippa Walton (Lecturer in Roman Archaeology, University of Leicester) and Glynn Davis (Senior Curator, Colchester Museums).
The student will undertake primary research at Colchester Museums’ Resource Centre, where the student will be part of the curatorial team.
They will also become part of the wider cohort of CDP-funded students across the UK.
An important Iron Age centre, then a Roman military installation and subsequently a major town, Camulodunum was integral to the foundation and development of the Roman province of Britannia.
Yet despite its significance, much of its material culture remains understudied.
Thousands of coins (the most ubiquitous of Roman artefacts) have been recovered from the town and its hinterland, but they have never been analysed in any detail.
This Collaborative Doctoral Partnership project will address this issue by exploring the function and use of coinage in Roman Colchester for the very first time.
Using the 9,749 coins held by Colchester Museums in its core collection, alongside Portable Antiquities Scheme data, published site reports and commercial archaeological ‘grey literature’, it will ask what numismatic data can reveal about the identity and workings of Camulodunum as an early and emergent Roman provincial hub.
Interrelated research questions that will drive the project include:
The project expects the student to reject the outdated application of the ‘Romanisation paradigm’, which has dominated in the field of Roman numismatics.
Instead, it will apply the work of academics who have critically reassessed ‘colonial archaeologies’ in the Roman province of Britannia.
The project will focus on comparing and contrasting experience amongst diverse communities both inside and outside the ancient city.
Collaborating with the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, it will also explore resonances of money with some of Colchester’s modern inhabitants, through participatory practice.

Project Title: Interstitial responses in glomerular diseases Project Description:
Glomerular diseases are a leading cause of kidney failure worldwide.1 IgA nephropathy (IgAN), IgA vasculitis (IgAV) and lupus nephritis (LN) are glomerular diseases that confer a high lifetime risk of progression to kidney failure, and predominantly affect young adults.2 Even with the recent approval of drugs that modulate glomerular haemodynamics or inflammation, most patients still progress to kidney failure.3,4 This confers an increased lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality.5
Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are strong predictors of progression to kidney failure, however the mechanisms driving these processes remain poorly defined.
It is unclear if these mechanisms are common across immune complex mediated glomerular diseases such as IgAN, IgAV and LN, or if they are disease-specific.
The pathways governing interstitial inflammation and fibrosis across these conditions need to be better defined, to allow the identification of targets for treatment which may meaningfully attenuate the risk of progression to kidney failure.
This project will aim to define pathways mediating interstitial inflammation and fibrosis that are both common and different between three archetypal immune complex mediated glomerular diseases: IgAN, IgAV and LN, using pre-transfusion kidney transplant samples as healthy controls.
To achieve this, the doctoral candidate will use a combination of approaches.
Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded tissue blocks of kidney tissue will be retrieved and sectioned on to glass slides.
The ethical approval for this is already in place.
Tissue sections will then be stained for infiltrating immune cells (including macrophages, mast cells, T-cells and B-cells) with immunofluorescent markers, and will then be subject to digital spatial transcriptomics using the GeoMx platform (which our laboratory has experience with and access to).
This will allow infiltrating immune cells and the interstitium immediately surrounding them to be transcriptomically profiled with next generation sequencing.
The data generated will be analysed using bioinformatic pipelines optimised by our laboratory, and pathway analysis will be performed to identify key receptor-ligand pairs between infiltrating cells and surrounding tissue that maybe mediating inflammation and fibrosis.
Pathways that are common to the three diseases as well as unique to them will be identified.
In-silica analysis, in collaboration with the EMBL institute, will be used to identify pathways most amenable to modulation by therapies that already exist.
The functional relevance of modulating these pathways will then be demonstrated in vitro using tissue culture of proximal tubular epithelial cells and collecting duct cells, which our laboratory has experience growing.

This is achieved through a combination of theoretical and skills based teaching.
We place an importance on the concepts of transferable skills and there is an expectation that trainees will learn to apply these skills across a range of clinical settings.
In addition to clinical skills based teaching, the programme covers a variety of conceptual frameworks for understanding and working with psychological distress, covering individual, (cognitive and behavioural therapies, and psychodynamic psychotherapy), systemic and community perspectives.
Throughout the programme an emphasis is placed on theory-practice links and this is supported by regular reflective practice seminars in which trainees discuss clinical cases.
Research is a key element of training to be a Clinical Psychologist and is integral to the programme.
Research teaching aims to enable trainees to become “research literate”, to develop and refine the necessary skills to evaluate their own clinical work, and to devise, project manage and implement both service-based and academic research.
Trainees undertake:
Assessments relevant to each of these three aspects of the programme are scheduled throughout the three years of training.
Over the three years of training, trainees will undertake a series of formal supervised clinical placements of six months to a year duration.
The placements will be in a variety of speciality areas in which clinical psychologists practice and provide trainees with a firm foundation in assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation skills.
Successful completion of this programme confers eligibility for Chartered Membership of the British Psychological Society and full membership of the Division of Clinical Psychology.
The Health and Care Professions Council has approved this programme.

New sentences found on https://le.ac.uk/study/undergraduates/fees-funding/paying-your-fees/sponsors:
A sponsor is a third party, eligible body or organisation that is responsible for payment of the student’s tuition fees that is paid directly to the University.
A sponsor will typically be an employer, government body or Embassy/Consular Office.
Where a sponsor agrees to pay tuition fees for an individual student, signed official evidence of the sponsor’s financial commitment is required at registration to cover the sponsorship period as published on the University’s website.
If an accepted sponsorship agreement is not received the student will be classed as self-funding.
Before your sponsor can pay your fees, the University needs to send them an invoice.
To do this, please submit a completed financial guarantee letter on official letterhead or a formal purchase order from the organisation and it needs to confirm the following information:
The sponsorship confirmation documentation must be signed by an authorised representative of the sponsoring organisation who has the authority to confirm approval of the amount stated.
Please email this to feesandincome@le.ac.uk
Third party, eligible body or organisation that makes a payment for tuition fees directly to the student are not treated as sponsors, meaning students are classified as being self-funding.
Individuals are not treated as sponsors; students whose tuition fees are paid by family members/friends are classified as being self-funding.
If a sponsor has failed to pay for fees in the past or have failed to pay within 2 months of the due date, the University reserves the right not to accept future sponsorship agreements from that organisation or company.
It is your responsibility to provide correct sponsorship details to ensure you are able to register for your course on time and that the University is able process the invoice to your sponsor and receive prompt payment of your fees.
The Student Fees and Income Management Office will review and verify the submitted sponsorship documentation.
If there are any issues such as incomplete documentation or if there are concerns following anti-money laundering checks, the team will contact you by email.
Once you have completed full registration and your course has started, an invoice will be sent directly to your sponsor and a copy will be sent to you.
Sponsors will be invoiced for the full amount of your annual sponsorship.
Your sponsor will have 30 days from the invoice date to make the payment and payment by instalments is not available.
Sponsors may pay tuition fees either for the whole programme at initial registration or the tuition fee for the whole of the current academic year at registration and re-registration, and are not eligible to pay in instalments.
By sending a sponsorship agreement to the University you are agreeing to give the university the right to disclose personal data to your sponsor as outlined in the Student Information Privacy Notice .
The University will process all personal data in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018.
Tuition fees are ultimately the responsibility of the student.
If a sponsor fails to pay a student’s tuition fee in accordance with the debt management recovery policy, the student will become liable for all unpaid tuition fees, in full immediately as stated in the University Senate Regulations 3 .
If your sponsorship agreement is annual, it is your responsibility to provide new supporting documents each academic year.

Fees and funding
Students are often targeted by fraudsters.
The University has a zero-tolerance policy to fraud.
If any payment made for a student is found to be fraudulent the student will face disciplinary action, including expulsion.
The University has financial obligations it must comply with when receiving payments.
Before choosing a method of payment please be aware of the following:
The UK, EU and US financial regulators have imposed financial sanctions on certain individuals, companies and banks, which means that in certain cases the University may not be able to receive payments.
Certain banks have been prevented from being able to send money to the UK and some banks have been prevented from using SWIFT or card payment.
In order for the University of Leicester to meet the financial obligations that we are required to comply with, applicants/students who have a nationality of a sanctioned country are required to supply the bank statement of all payments made for them, regardless of origin, to make sure that the University is adhering to its financial obligations.
However, any student may be required to provide this information at the discretion of the university.
The University is also required to “know your customer (KYC)” and part of this is that the University knows who has made payment into the University bank account.
If the payee is not the applicant/student then we will require a copy of the payee's passport/driving license, along with an explanation as to the relationship of the payee, the reason why the payee is paying and if you are going to make payment direct to the payee at some point.
If you receive a payment request please ensure you are confident it has been sent by the University.
The following information can help you check any request you received:
If you are unsure a payment request you receive was sent by the University please contact us before making payment.
Cash payments are not accepted by the University and cash deposited into our bank account will also not be accepted.

"Having not formally studied for over a decade, I was a little unsure about taking on a full module, particularly as my degrees had been in a different discipline.
However, the Qualitative module is so well structured and began with the basics, gradually building up knowledge in the relevant areas as the course progressed.
I didn’t feel that I was at a disadvantage undertaking this module as a standalone CPD course rather than part of the wider MRes in Applied Health Research as the material was contained and relevant.
"There was a great balance between theory and practice, which allowed us to experience how concepts could be applied within the discipline.
The timetabling of the sessions also gave me time to absorb what I’d learned in each teaching week before subsequent sessions.
Both assessments were at an appropriate level, with enough support and contextual information to set us in the right direction.
"For me personally, undertaking the module has reignited by passion to continue my own education with a clearer view of what I would like to achieve.
It has given me the confidence to pursue opportunities that I had thought were outside of my scope and capability, with the module having acted as a bridge between my previous formal education in the Humanities and my new journey towards a research-focused career in Sociology and Health."

Develop your pharmacy career by becoming an Independent Prescriber and make a positive impact on patient care.
prescribingcourse@leicester.ac.uk
As part of its long term plan the NHS has been developing clinical pathways that widen the remit of pharmacists, which in turn have a major positive impact on patient care - from diagnosis to prescribing.
Part of this initiative involves broadening pharmacists' skills through training to become Independent Prescribers.
At Leicester, the School of Healthcare’s accessible Pharmacist Independent Prescribing course is designed to support the pharmacy integration programme and enables pharmacists to become confident and knowledgeable non-medical prescribers.
In fact, it is considered such an important part of the modern pharmacist's role that, as of 2026, all pharmacy graduates will be independent prescribers.
This programme comprises one 30 credit module.
It’s designed to provide pharmacists with the knowledge and skills to prescribe within their chosen scope of practice.
Upon successful completion, you will be awarded a Practice Certificate in Independent Prescribing and be eligible for annotation on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register or PSNI register as an independent prescriber.
This programme is ideal if you have work and personal commitments.
It has a flexible format and is delivered using predominantly distance learning approaches, which means it is open to registered pharmacists from across England.
The course comprises five virtual, interactive facilitated teaching sessions, and two face-to-face sessions delivered over a range of dates in locations across England.
The course is entirely portfolio based with no OSCE style assessments.

"My intended scope of practice is the management of minor ear, nose, and throat (ENT) conditions in adults.
In my learning in practice setting within a GP practice I will have the opportunity to frequently encounter patients with ENT conditions as there is a minor ailments clinic daily, which is run by prescribing nurse practitioner and is supported by practice GPs as well as my DPP (Designated Prescribing Practitioner).
I have agreed with the practice team that I will have the opportunity to participate in this clinic under the supervision of a prescriber.
This will allow me to develop the knowledge and skills to take a medical history and undertake any necessary clinical examinations to make a differential diagnosis.
I will make prescribing recommendations or appropriate management plans to support my diagnosis."
"My intended scope of practice is the management of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults (excluding pregnancy).
In my learning in practice setting within an acute hospital I work in the trauma and orthopaedic department.
I will have the opportunity to frequently encounter patients who have developed either Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism.
These are known complications in orthopaedic wards.
My DPP is an advanced nurse practitioner who works in both the pre and post operative areas within trauma and orthopaedics.
I will be participating in preoperative assessment which will l include the completion of the VTE assessment on admission to establish patient risk prior to surgery and I will be participating in ward rounds of post operative surgical patients alongside the surgical team and advanced practitioners.
I have agreed with my DPP that I will assess patients for post operative complications this will allow me to take a medical history and undertake any necessary clinical examinations and request and interpret any tests or investigations to make a differential diagnosis of VTEs.
I will create a management plan for the patient and make any appropriate prescribing decisions."

The course was full for the cohort I applied for – do I have to reapply for the next cohort?
If the course is full, you will be offered a place in the next available cohort.
Here are the steps to follow:
You do not need to reapply for the next cohort, but timely confirmation and an updated declaration form are required to secure your place.
I have completed Part 1 of the supplementary information form, and I am waiting for my DPP to return from holiday to complete part 2.
Can I submit part 1 only and part 2 later?
To ensure your application is processed in a timely manner, please wait until both parts of the supplementary form are complete before submitting.
Parts 1 and 2 must be fully completed before the application is reviewed by a course team member.
Part submissions of the form will delay the processing of your application.
Your place on the course will not be secure with an incomplete submission.
I would like to choose infections (all types) as my scope of practice, is this appropriate?
This is too broad as a scope of practice because you would have to demonstrate competence to diagnose and prescribe for all types of infections in order to pass the programme.
This scope should be narrowed to make the workload achievable.
A few examples of appropriately narrowed scope would be respiratory infections, pneumonia (community acquired and hospital acquired), skin infections and childhood infections.
I would like to choose travel medicine as my scope of practice.
Is this appropriate?
We do not recommend scopes of practice in which the diagnosis element is limited, and breadth of different treatment options is narrow.
This is because it is challenging for the trainee prescriber to demonstrate competence in all prescribing learning outcomes across a diverse range of medicines.
Examples of other scopes of practice that may be challenging include contraception, childhood immunisations and aesthetic medicine.
However, in most cases your application will not be rejected based on the scope of practice you have chosen as you will have an opportunity to refine or change your scope when you start the course after discussion with the course team.
Your chosen scope must however align with the expertise of your DPP (if they are not a doctor) e.g., Diabetes IP (Independent Prescribing) pharmacist DPP would supervise a trainee with a chosen scope of diabetes.
My DPP is 2.5 hours away from where I am based – will this be a problem?
In the section titled 'Learning in practice setting and Designated Prescribing Practitioner (DPP)' please outline your plan for completing the 90 hours.
Travel must be considered, as this plays a significant role in determining whether your hours are achievable.
We need to see that you have thoughtfully considered the logistics of spending your time in practice.
My DPP is already supervising two other trainees for IP.
Can they be my DPP?
The course requirements are that any DPP only supervise a maximum of you and one other trainee.
Therefore, you would need to find another DPP who is not already supervising two others.
This is applicable even if the other trainees are completing courses at other universities.
My learning in practice setting is a community pharmacy - is this okay?
If the learning-in-practice setting is listed as a community pharmacy, you would need to ensure that you provide sufficient information in the supplementary form e.g.
detailing whether this is a clinic your DPP runs, if this is a pathfinder site, and if you will have access to methods to request and review biochemistry results for differential diagnosis and monitoring of therapy, as well as referral pathways.
These are essential for fulfilling the course learning outcomes.
If my current DPP was no longer able to be my DPP before I hear back from the university, would this affect my application if I managed to find someone else to be my DPP?
You must inform the admissions team if there are any changes to your circumstances, including changes to your Designated Prescribing Practitioner (DPP).
Such changes must be reviewed and approved by the course team.
Please ensure to communicate any updates promptly to avoid potential delays or complications with your application process.
I have found a DPP who is a dentist but she is situated next to a GP surgery so I will be able to spend a significant amount of time with GPs and nurses observing and practicing my intended scope of ENT – is this okay?
The DPP must have relevant expertise to sign off on all aspects of your scope of practice, including case-base discussions, clinical case studies, and clinical examinations relevant to the scope of practice.
It is essential to ensure that your DPP has the necessary expertise in ENT or a related field to effectively support and sign off your training activities.
Dentists would not be well placed to fulfil these requirements adequately.
