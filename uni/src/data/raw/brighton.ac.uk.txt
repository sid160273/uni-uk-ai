This website is run by the University of Brighton.
The University of Brighton is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.
2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
That means you should be able to:
You’ll also find our accessibility toolbar (accessed from any page by clicking on ‘accessibility options’ in our site header) which provides additional functions including:
You can find out more about the Recite Me Accessibility tool on their website.
We also try to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.
AbilityNet is a great resource helping people with a disability to use digital technology.
They provide advice on making your device easier to use .
We know some parts of this website aren’t fully accessible and are working to resolve this.
We are working hard to make our website accessible.
If you need information on this website in a different format, the Recite Me toolbar will allow you to access content in a variety of accessible formats.
If you have been unable to access the content that you need using either the website or the Recite Me toolbar, let us know through our accessibility issue form and we will do what we can to help.
We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of www.brighton.ac.uk.
If you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or think we’re not meeting the requirements of the accessibility regulations, please report it through our accessibility issue form or email webteam@brighton.ac.uk .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations.
If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) .
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to these non-compliances:
It’s not possible for users to modify text spacing or line height by default, however this can be achieved through the use of our accessibility toolbar or by the use of standard browser features.
When we redesign our site we will address this so that it is possible without the use of the accessibility toolbar.
Some link text doesn’t make sense when read on its own, for example, 'click here'.
Or in some case the same link text is used to link to more than one destination.
We monitor link text on a weekly basis and rectify any issues as we find them.
When we publish new content we’ll make sure link text meets accessibility standards and that all staff publishing content have had the appropriate training to make sure that this happens.
Many of our older PDFs and Word documents don’t meet accessibility standards, for example, they may not be marked up so they’re accessible to a screen reader.
The accessibility regulations don’t require us to fix PDFs or other documents that were published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
However, all documents under the control of the University of Brighton can be accessed through our accessibility toolbar and consumed in a variety of accessible formats.
Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
Live video streams don’t have captions, however for graduation ceremonies, live signing will be shown on screen.
We don’t plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations .
This website (www.brighton.ac.uk) is tested every week using a third-party tool called Silktide for which we pay an annual subscription.
This tool assesses every page on our website and highlights issues and potential issues against the WGAC AA standard.
It also tracks our progress in addressing issues.
It should be noted that this tool cannot interact with our accessibility toolbar and therefore reports some issues that are resolved by using the toolbar, for example reporting insufficient contrast – contrast can be changed easily through the toolbar to the user’s requirements.
Where possible we test with real users, as we know that automated tools will not pick up on all potential issues.
We have included an example of testing with real users in video format.
You can also access a transcript of the user testing video .
Please enable targeting cookies in order to view this video content on our website, or you can watch the video on YouTube .
Our website is assessed each week to highlight accessibility issues through the use of Siteimprove reporting and work put in place to resolve them.
We also test with real users to highlight issues that cannot be picked up by automated tools.
Our commitment is to list all issues that we identify in this statement, and update it weekly to include the number of issues found alongside the mitigating actions that we will take.
This statement was prepared on 22 September 2019.

You can also contact organisations to enquire if they would consider taking you on as an apprentice.

Entry requirements and applications
For most degree apprenticeships you need to be 16+.
There is no upper age limit.
University of Brighton offers Higher and Degree Apprenticeships.
Each apprenticeship has its own entry requirements, which can be found on the programme pages.
Generally, you need a level 3 qualification such as an Advanced Apprenticeship, NVQ or A-levels.
You’ll also need level 2 (or equivalent) English and maths.
If you don't have the correct qualifications, we can support you through our partner, Functional Skills UK.
We will make sure you have enough time to complete your qualifications to the highest standard possible.
You should discuss this with your employer and the academic lead before you apply.
You can start applying for higher and degree apprenticeships at any time, but please check specific programme pages for application closing dates.
Apply through our application portal .
Firstly, confirm your employer is happy to support you and fund the apprenticeship, and is fully aware of the commitments involved, then access our application portal and create an account.
Select ‘Apply to new course’ and select either ‘Undergraduate course’ or ‘Taught postgraduate course’ and type ‘Apprenticeship’ into the keyword box.
Next, choose the programme you want to apply to, and select a start date.
Finally, complete your application form and submit it to us for review.
When completing your degree apprenticeship application, you’ll need to write a personal statement.
Use this to tell us about your motivation and enthusiasm, and demonstrate your suitability for the programme.
It will help your application to include examples of relevant work, voluntary or study experiences and transferable skills you will use when you become an apprentice.
You should include:
Download our Careers Skills Workbook to help you with your application – it includes examples of paragraph structures and core skills.
Programme lengths and assessments
You should work for a minimum of 30 hours per week and you study for 20% of your working hours, typically equivalent to four days work and one day study day per week.
If you’re employed fewer than 30 hours per week, your employer will need to check with us to make sure you meet the course criteria.
The length of a degree apprenticeship depends on the level of qualification and what is agreed between your employer and the university.
Our degree apprenticeships generally last between one and six years.
Check individual programme pages for more details .
Yes, part-time apprenticeships (minimum of 16 hours per week) can be agreed with an employer if there’s a reason you can’t work full-time, for example, care responsibilities.
Yes, there is some flexibility and the length of the apprenticeship can be extended with your employer’s permission.
Once you have completed your academic degree programme and demonstrated the knowledge, skills and behaviours required of your chosen occupation, you take an End Point Assessment (EPA).
EPAs vary but usually include a formal exam and an interview with an independent assessor.
After completing the assessments, you will achieve your final award and complete the programme.
The University of Brighton issues your academic award such as your bachelors degree.
You may also receive membership or eligibility tot apply for membership of a professional body.
Your certificate of completion is awarded by Apprenticeship Certificates England (ACE).
Work and university life
University of Brighton assesses your progress and supports you during their apprenticeship.
We work very closely with the employer to ensure that apprentices receive:
This will all be documented in a commitment statement that is part of the Apprenticeship Agreement, an individual learning plan that the provider, the employer and apprentice all sign up to.
No.
When you apply for an apprenticeship the length of your employment will be set out in your Apprenticeship Agreement.
Many apprentices stay with their sponsoring employer and get a permanent job afterwards, but this is at the discretion of the employer.
Changing employers during the apprenticeship is possible but can be complicated.
This must be agreed by the university, including a record of what was achieved in the previous employment and what will be covered in the new job.
Off-the-job learning is undertaken outside of day-to-day duties of your role.
This could include attending university sessions (in person or online), self-directed study or continuous professional development courses.
Off-the-job learning follows an agreed schedule between you, your employer and the training provider (the University of Brighton).
On-the-job learning is what you develop naturally in the workplace.
On-the-job learning should include mentoring and coaching from colleagues, managers or supervisors to help you to develop your skills.
Apprentices enrolled with the university receive similar benefits as the rest of our students, including access to online learning and library facilities.
You won’t live in university halls, but can use facilities and join clubs and societies.
However, remember that an apprenticeship is first and foremost a job that encompasses a formal qualification, so it is a very different experience to being a full-time student.
At the start of the apprenticeship, you sign a three-way Apprenticeship Agreement with the training provider (the University of Brighton) and your employer.
This details the occupation you will be trained for, the dates of the apprenticeship and overview of the training provided.
You also sign a Commitment Statement.
This includes the training content and schedule, what’s expected of each party and details on how to resolve complaints.
Support and guidance
Our Work-Based Learning Support and Guidance Tutors (WBLSGTs) strengthen the bridge between on- and off-the-job learning.
They liaise with employers, workplace mentors and academic tutors to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of your progress during regular tripartite reviews.
They provide non-judgmental, one-to-one guidance and support on issues affecting your ability to succeed.
They also sign-post to specialist services in the university and agree supportive action plans with the employers for workplace learning.
Degree apprentices may be able to get additional support through the university (but not the Disabled Students Allowance).
You may also be able to apply for Access to Work funding for work-based equipment and software.
Get in touch with our Disability and Learning Support team for further information.
University of Brighton has a wide range of support services available to apprentices through Student Services .
For information on events, activities, plus support services and campaigns, contact Brighton Students' Union .
Employability support for apprentices
As part of achieving your apprenticeship standard, you are already working towards developing skills and professional behaviours.
Alongside these skills and behaviours set out by your apprenticeship, you will also be developing your Brighton Graduate Attributes – wide-ranging skillsets which will give you additional value in the workplace, whatever your chosen career.
Here are some extra methods of support we offer our apprentices:
In the unfortunate event that your employer makes you redundant before the end of your apprenticeship, we can offer support and guidance to help you look for employment for the rest of your apprenticeship programme.
As your training provider, we may still be able to offer training in the short term while our careers team support you to find a new employer.
If you are at risk of redundancy or have been made redundant, contact the Apprenticeships team on apprenticeships@brighton.ac.uk to find out if there are current vacancies with our partner organisations.
Or visit our Apprentices Advice Centre .
Finance
The cost of your learning programme is covered by your employer  through their Digital Apprenticeship Service (DAS) account, so it costs you nothing!
In the first year of an apprenticeship, you must be paid, as a minimum, in line with the national minimum wage for apprentices.
After a year in the workplace, this should increase to the national minimum wage or more.
Your employer may choose to pay more than this amount, but this is discretionary.
Check the current minimum wage rates: www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates .
Higher and degree level apprentices don’t get student loans.
This is because the learning fees are funded by your employer and the government.
Higher and degree level apprentices must fulfil the standard eligibility criteria to apply for means-tested benefits such as Universal Credit, Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit.
Our Student Advice Service can help with questions about benefits.
If you are in full-time study, you could be exempt from paying Council Tax.
Check GOV.UK for more information: www.gov.uk/council-tax/who-has-to-pay .
Although some programmes require study on a day-release arrangement, this can still be classed as full-time study.
You will need to obtain a letter from the Student Support Desk at any campus and send this to your Council Tax department when you enrol on the programme.

IMD stands for the Index of Multiple Deprivation, this is a UK government measure used to classify postcodes in England based on factors which include income, employment, education, housing, and crime rate.
IMD rankings range from 1 to 5 quintiles (sometimes extended to 10 deciles), where typically IMD quintile 1 indicates higher levels of socioeconomic disadvantage and quintile 5 indicates comparatively lower levels of disadvantage.
The University of Brighton uses this classification to target additional support for eligible students.
Our postcode checker uses the postcode you entered—which should be the one you’re using for your Student Finance England application—to confirm IMD quintile.
Once we determine your IMD quintile, we can show you what support you could qualify for at Brighton.
This could include reduced grade offer and financial help with accommodation, travel and study costs.
Yes.
If you live in a postcode outside England, you may still qualify for certain elements of Brighton Boost and a reduced grade offer due to our flexible, personalised approach to admissions.
We consider every application individually and we would encourage you to provide information about any challenges you’ve faced that fall outside our standard contextual criteria in your application.
The IMD data we use is sourced directly from official government statistics and is regularly updated.
If you believe there is an error, you can contact our admissions team via your Student View account to discuss your individual circumstances.
If you live in an eligible postcode and your household income is under £25,000, you may qualify for support from Brighton Boost in your first year and then further support in subsequent years of study.
The bursary provides £500 in Year 2 and Year 3 of your studies (full-time students) once we’ve confirmed your household income status through Student Finance England.
We’ll verify your eligibility after we receive your official student finance information, usually within the first term.
If you change your permanent home address or your financial circumstances change significantly, please let us know as soon as possible.
We’ll re-check your eligibility for a contextual offer or financial support accordingly.

For most full-time undergraduate courses, apply through the UCAS website .
They can choose up to five courses at five universities, and apply for more than one course at a university.
They also don't need to make all five choices at the same time and don't need to make choices in order of preference.
Universities don't see where else they have applied until after deciding on offers.
For some courses, students will be shortlisted and interviewed before receiving an offer.
For other courses, offers will be made on the basis of information provided in the UCAS application.
Each university responds to applications via the UCAS website with either a conditional offer, dependent on getting specific grades, or an unconditional offer.
Important dates
UCAS dates The main UCAS deadline is in late-January , but students can apply for courses that still have places until July .
If a student has used all five choices on UCAS and is not holding any offers, they can add more choices through UCAS Extra from February to June.
School and university dates UK schools and colleges submit applications on behalf of their students, so they will have their own deadlines.
These will usually be in November or December so that teachers have enough time to write academic references.
At Brighton we make offers from the autumn term onwards.
For certain courses we also hold interviews from autumn onwards.
Interviews will be held online for students starting in 2025.
If your child has applied before the mid-January deadline and not heard from us by the end of February, then they should contact our admissions team .

Students can apply through UCAS Clearing from 5 July onwards , although most apply immediately after A-level results in August.

Loans and funding
Consider finance as early as possible in the application process so that your child’s payment is not delayed.
You can apply for student finance before an offer has been confirmed.
Parents and students need to complete their own sections of the application form.
Most students applying for their first undergraduate degree can receive a non means-tested tuition fee loan, which covers the cost of tuition, and a maintenance loan for accommodation, travel and other living costs.
Students only start to pay back a loan after finishing studying and only when earning over the repayment threshold, currently £27,295 a year.
Government funding Course-specific funding is available for teacher training routes.
For more information, visit the Department for Education's bursaries website .
Extra government funding is also available in certain circumstances, including:

It's a big change when a young person starts university and we know that the last two years have presented some big challenges.

Packing
There's a lot to remember when a young person starts university.
To make sure they don't forget anything, make a packing checklist:
Housekeeping
Get your child familiar with domestic chores before they go – washing up, doing laundry and cleaning the house.
Talk to them about keeping on top of bills too – council tax exemptions, TV licences, electricity and water.
Money matters Student loans are paid in a lump sum at the start of each term.
Remind them that their loan needs to last a whole term, and make a list of expenses.
Most banks offer students accounts with overdrafts.
Many also offer incentives such as free railcards and 0% interest on overdrafts.
The My finances section shares advice and tips on money matters.
Food
Food is often the biggest expense and cooking for themselves is cost-effective, so teach your child to cook cheap, tasty meals without breaking the bank – pasta, curry, soups and even a Sunday roast.
All of our halls are self-catered but students can add in a food and drink plan (no need to wash up!).
To find out more about meals at Brighton, see our food on campus information.
Welcome and induction
There is a lot to remember in the first few weeks at university.
Luckily, we have a handy first week checklist to help you – from registration to welcome events and the Students' Union.
Travel
Whether you walk, cycle, take the bus, the train, or share a car, find out about options for getting to and from university with our guide to student travel options .
Paid work
Having a part-time job during term-time can be beneficial for students.
As well as earning money, a part-time job helps students enhance their CV, providing vital experience for future job applications.
However, students must strike a balance between work and studies.
At Brighton, we recommend that students do not work more than 15 hours per week during term-time.
We work with local employers to regularly update students on part-time job opportunities and employment events.
Students can start by visiting the university's Vacancy and Events Service .
Another great way to gain experience and earn money is by becoming a Student Ambassador .
Students can also get advice from the Careers Service on finding a part-time job .
Registering with a doctor
All students studying in the UK for more than six months are eligible for NHS services.
To register, students need photographic ID and proof of address.
Students who choose to register with an on-site surgeries will also need to show a valid student ID or library card.
We recommend that students register with a doctor shortly after arriving.
This is important so that they can be seen as quickly as possible if they notice symptoms of illness.
Our Moulsecoomb campus has an on-site GP surgery , in addition to nearby GP surgeries.
Wellbeing
Going to university is exciting and enjoyable, but it can also be hard to manage.
At Brighton we have a range of support available – Student Support and Guidance Tutors (SSGTs) , counsellors, specialists in disability and dyslexia, and health advice.
Visit our dedicated My Wellbeing section for further information.
Student Support and Guidance Tutors
Known as SSGTs, these tutors are available to all students.
They work for Student Services but are embedded in academic schools alongside academic staff.
Whether your child has an issue with accommodation, academic deadlines or general wellbeing, these professionals can help.
Visit our SSGT page for to find out more.
Disability and dyslexia

When you have met these conditions, you should provide this to the Doctoral College.
When you have met all the conditions of your offer, we will provide you with a new offer letter.
Except where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for meeting the conditions of your offer.
However, make sure you leave enough time after meeting the conditions to make arrangements to start your course, for example if you need to arrange accommodation or a visa.

A CAS is a unique reference number that is 14 digits long that is given to you by the University of Brighton.
It confirms to the Home Office that you have accepted an unconditional offer and met with the Home Office requirements regarding length of study in the UK and academic progression.
As part of your unconditional offer, you will be asked to complete a visa questionnaire.
Our visa compliance team will then review your eligibility and issue a CAS number, as appropriate.
More information is available on our international pages .

If you are self-funded we cannot issue you with a CAS until you have paid your tuition fee deposit.
We would advise that you pay this as soon as possible so that you are able to make your visa application in plenty of time.
More information about the tuition fee deposit and how to pay it is available on the international student fees page .
If you are a funded student, you will need to provide proof of your sponsorship before the tuition fee deposit can be waived.

English language requirements
Applicants from outside the UK need to meet specific English language requirements in order to study for a PhD at the University of Brighton.
The UK Visa and Immigration Authority (UKVI) has a defined list of Majority English-Speaking Countries .
(N.B.
this list is not generated by the University of Brighton and we are not able to adjust or deviate from its definitions.)
You may not need to prove your knowledge of English language if:
You are a national of one of the countries listed on the Government’s UKVI webpage
You have completed a Bachelor’s degree or higher in the last three years from one of the countries listed on the Government’s UKVI webpage*
*If you have a qualification from one of the listed countries but it was completed more than three years ago, it is a University of Brighton requirement that you provide further evidence of your English Language in the form of one of our accepted English tests.
For more information on the accepted tests, please see our English language requirements for research degrees .
Please note that the results from the tests are valid for two years from the test date.
The results must be valid on your course start date.
The minimum standard of English competence accepted is equivalent to the International English Languages Testing System (IELTS) scores in the table below.
TOEFL iBT, Pearson Academic or Kaplan Test of English results should be equivalent to the IELTS scores above.
If you are concerned that you might not reach the required level for the course, and therefore may need to take an English Language course, we recommend that you take the ‘IELTS for UKVI Academic’ at an approved test centre, details of which can be found on the Government website .
If you need further advice, please email DoctoralCollege@brighton.ac.uk .
Terms and deadlines
It is common for PhD students to begin in the October following their application, fitting to normal academic term calendars.
This also suits the funding cycle for a number of funding bodies.
However, we operate a rolling intake so students can make applications at any time throughout the year.
Start dates will always be on the first working day of the month and will normally be determined as follows:
UK/EU students: Normally one month after an offer is made
International students: Normally three months after an offer is made
Professional Doctorates and programmes with a taught component usually have one intake a year in October or January.
Undertaking research study will require university fees as well as support for your research activities and plans for subsistence during full or part-time study.
Funding sources include self-funding, funding by an employer or industrial partners; there are competitive funding opportunities available in most disciplines through, for example, our own university studentships or national (UK) research councils.
International students may have options from either their home-based research funding organisations or may be eligible for some UK funds.
Learn more about the funding opportunities available to you.
Standard fees are listed below, but may vary depending on subject area.
Some subject areas may charge bench fees/consumables; this will be decided as part of any offer made.
Fees for UK and international/EU students on full-time and part-time courses are likely to incur a small inflation rise each year of a research programme.

The Brighton Summer Boost package has been introduced to make sure that students applying through Clearing and who need extra support to start university aren’t left behind.
It’s the first time that the university has offered dedicated financial assistance during the Clearing period – which opens on 1 July 2025 ready for students to start their course in September – providing targeted help to ensure every applicant who needs it can start university with confidence.
Building on the successful launch of Brighton Boost in 2024, this latest initiative reflects the university’s continued focus on widening access to higher education and creating more opportunities for students from all backgrounds – particularly those who may have traditionally been underrepresented or felt university was out of their reach.
The Brighton Summer Boost is designed to provide additional help to those who need it most – especially students whose commuting or relocation costs may present an obstacle to starting university.

The Brighton Summer Boost sits alongside the university’s existing bursary scheme, meaning students from the most financially challenging circumstances will continue to receive the highest levels of support.

This recognition - as reported in the 2025 Global 2000 list by the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) - highlights the university’s continued dedication to academic excellence, impactful research, and the success of its students and alumni worldwide.
The 2025 CWUR rankings are the largest of their kind, based entirely on outcome-based data, rather than surveys or self-submitted statistics.
Universities are assessed across four key pillars: education, employability, faculty, and research – all of which reflect measurable impact on students and society.
This year’s results were drawn from over 74 million data points, offering a robust and comprehensive picture of institutional performance.
This achievement reflects Brighton’s growing global reputation as a university that nurtures talent, drives innovation, and delivers real-world impact through education and research.
Vice-Chancellor Professor Donna Whitehead commented: "This recognition from CWUR is a reflection of the dedication of our staff and the ambition of our students.
To be ranked among the top institutions worldwide – based on outcomes that truly matter – is a fantastic testament to the strength of our academic community, our research impact, and the transformative experience we offer our students."
As a university committed to delivering research that changes lives, and education that empowers individuals and communities, Brighton is proud to be counted among the leading institutions driving global progress.

Varley Park – which provides 771 beds for University of Brighton students – will now be managed and operated by Every Student, a specialist UK-based affordable student accommodation operator, following acquisition by UOL Group Ltd, one of Singapore’s leading property and hospitality groups.
UOL will also fund a package of financial support and other opportunities for Black students to advance racial equity at Brighton.
This reflects the commitment to advancing equity shared by both organisations.
In partnership with UOL, the university will now develop detailed proposals for the financial support package that will be specifically available for Black students that, to date, include:
Across the higher education sector, systemic disadvantage means that Black students are less likely to continue and complete their studies, less likely to be awarded a 1 st /2:1, and less likely to go on to graduate-level employment or further study than other ethnic groups.
The support package funded by UOL will provide further targeted support for Black students as part of a range of measures at the University of Brighton designed to tackle deep-rooted societal inequity.
Professor Donna Whitehead, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Brighton, said:
“The sale of Varley Park unlocks vital investment that will allow us to deliver on our transformation plan, while continuing to provide high-quality accommodation and other facilities for our students.
“I’m particularly delighted that we have been able to secure additional financial support from UOL for Black students at the University of Brighton as part of our commitment to equity and to levelling the playing field for all members of our community.
“We know that, as individuals and as an institution, we have the power and duty to help drive societal change.
I look forward to working with UOL and our university community to turn this into further meaningful action.”
The £43.5m sale forms a key part of the university’s transformation plan and will enable significant investment in digital infrastructure and building renovations across the university’s three campuses.
These improvements will enhance the student and staff experience and support the university’s recently published strategy, Distinctively Brighton 2035 .
Varley Park will continue to operate as student accommodation for University of Brighton students through a leaseback arrangement.

New sentences found on https://brighton.ac.uk/news/2023/brighton-secures-national-silver-award-for-teaching-excellence:
The University of Brighton has been recognised for the quality of its teaching and student outcomes in a UK-wide evaluation of higher education institutions.
28 September 2023
The university has today secured a Silver award in the national Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).
The award confirms that the student experience and student outcomes across all of the university's undergraduate provision including apprenticeships are "typically very high quality", delivering excellence above the rigorous standards set for the UK’s higher education providers.
The rating lasts for four years, until September 2027.
The TEF is a national scheme run by the Office for Students (OfS).
It aims to encourage universities to improve and deliver excellence in the areas that students care about the most: teaching, learning and achieving positive outcomes from their studies.
The University of Brighton offers a wide range of support to help students succeed academically and set them on their chosen career path.
Employability is fundamental to all Brighton courses and students are encouraged to take up industry placements and other work-related experience.
As a result, Brighton is in the top 50 universities for graduate prospects , with 91.4% of students in work or further study.
High scores on employability and other student outcomes also helped Brighton jump up by 22 places in this year’s Guardian University Guide 2024.
The Guardian also ranked Brighton at number 11 nationally for value-added – a score which compares a student’s degree results with their entry qualifications to show how effectively they are taught.
This underlines the ongoing success of the university's ability to support each student's educational circumstances, and to make sure that every individual is given equal opportunity to achieve their potential.
Commenting on the results, Professor Debra Humphris CBE, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Brighton, said: "Brighton continues to be a destination of choice for students from our region, across the UK and around the world.
By focusing on what matters most to them – high quality teaching, modern facilities and great job prospects – we're setting our students up for a successful future, whichever path they choose."
"I am delighted that the teaching, learning and outcomes we provide for our students have been assessed to consistently exceed the rigorous standards set down for UK universities.
This is a great result and further underlines the enduring value of a University of Brighton degree.
"We will continue to use feedback from our students and the Teaching Excellence Framework results to look at how we can make further improvements."

We are committed to building on existing success and achieving further external recognition for equality and diversity, including through Athena Swan, Stonewall and the Race Equality Charter.
In order to enable these ambitions and develop our capacity in this area, the university is a member of Advance HE.
As a member of Advance HE we are committed to addressing the university’s specific equality needs and are part of a supported community of good practice across the higher education sector.
Equality charters are initiatives aimed at recognising work to advance equality and diversity in higher education.

We are currently actively involved in charters or other benchmarking initiatives in the areas of:
Athena Swan
The Athena Swan Charter recognises commitment to addressing unequal gender representation across academic disciplines and professional and support functions.
Its aim is towards the advancement of gender equality, representation, progression and success for all.
Athena Swan is the longest running of Advance HE’s equality charters and was established to encourage advancing the careers of women in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM) in higher education and research.
In 2015 the charter was expanded to recognise work undertaken in arts, humanities, social sciences, business and law (AHSSBL), in professional and support roles and for trans staff and students.
Also to recognise work undertaken to address gender equality more broadly, and not just barriers to progression that affect women.
In 2021 the charter was further enhanced to support greater inclusivity for people in all roles, of all gender identities, and those facing intersectional inequalities.
Athena Swan covers women, and men where appropriate, in:

Disability Confident
The university is a Disability Confident employer; a government scheme replacing the 'Two Ticks' initiative to support disability equality in staff recruitment and retention practices.
This move enables our on-going commitment to employing people with disabilities and health conditions, as well as ensuring every possible opportunity to progress at the university.
Disability Confident is a voluntary scheme that has been developed in partnership with disabled people’s representatives.
It is a Jobcentre Plus initiative for employers who are taking action to meet commitments regarding the employment, retention, training and career development of employees with disabilities.
These commitments are integral to the university’s strategy promise to enable our staff and liberate talent.
As a Disability Confident Employer we are committed to:
The university is a Level 2 Disability Confident employer, which recognises our demonstrable action to ensure disabled people have a fair chance to work for and progress at the university.
The university has a higher representation of staff with declared disabilities (9.5%) than the UK Higher Education sector average (5.3%) and disabled applicants to the university have good success rates (2019–20 Annual Staff Monitoring Report).
The university’s Disability and Carers Equality Champion is Matt Kitson, Director of Estates and Facilities Management, who represents concerns relating to equality for people with disabilities and long-term health conditions and those with caring responsibilities at the University Executive Board.
A working group represented by the Disability and Carer’s Staff Network, guides progress on Disability Confident, which is reported to the Equality and Diversity Committee.
The university signed the Time to Change Employer Pledge in 2017, in order to change how we think and act about mental health in the workplace and make sure that employees who are facing these problems feel supported.
The actions from the Time to Change Pledge reviewed by the working group in 2020 aim to accelerate progress particularly in relation to mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Race Equality Charter Mark
The Race Equality Charter is aimed at improving the representation, progression and success of minority ethnic staff and students within higher education.
It provides a framework through which institutions work to identify and self-reflect on institutional and cultural barriers standing in the way of minority ethnic staff and students.
It covers:
The Race Equality Charter was developed in 2014 following the impact Athena Swan has had in gender equality.
The University of Brighton participated in the trial framework with 21 other volunteer institutions, resulting in eight institutions receiving a Bronze Award.
Following participation in 2015, the university increased capacity and resources to fully meet the expectations of the scheme.
A Bronze award recognises that a university has a foundation for eliminating racial inequalities and developing an inclusive culture that values all staff and students.
This is underpinned by core principles: that racial inequalities are a significant issue within Higher Education, and exist in the context of racism in UK society which manifests itself in everyday situations, processes and behaviours.
The principles identify that individuals from all ethnic backgrounds must be enabled to benefit equally from the opportunities that Higher Education affords, recognising differing intersecting identities and experiences amongst Minority Ethnic staff and students.
Importantly the principles require the solutions to racial inequalities to be aimed at achieving long-term institutional culture change and avoiding a deficit model where solutions are aimed at changing the individual.
Application for Bronze Race Equality Charter (pdf)
Find out more about race equality work at the university
The university was successful in achieving a Bronze Award for the application submitted in July 2019.
The award is valid for five years until 2024.
This application was the culmination of a two year project undertaking a comprehensive self-assessment of race equality across the institution, including analysis of staff and student data, staff and student consultation in the 2018 Race Equality Surveys and focus groups, and developing a robust action plan aimed at achieving long-term institutional culture change.
The university’s involvement and advancement in regards to the Race Equality Charter is guided by the REC Steering Group, which is chaired by the university’s Race and Faith Equality Champion, Professor Andrew Lloyd, Pro-Vice Chancellor (Academic Operations), and has representation from academic, professional and support staff from across our university and colleagues from the Staff Race and Faith Staff Network, our Trade Unions and Brighton Students' Union.
Addressing unequal representation and progression for Minority Ethnic staff and students is a key priority for the university.
The Race Equality Steering Group will monitor implementation of the Action Plan which will be formally reported to the Equality and Diversity Committee chaired by the Vice-Chancellor on a quarterly basis.
Stonewall
Stonewall is the largest Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT+) rights charity in Europe.
The university is a proud member of Stonewall’s Proud Employers programme (formerly called the Diversity Champions programme).
The programme supports and promotes fair practice in relation to the employment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff, and our role as a Stonewall Proud Employer is integral to our commitment to equality for LGBTQ+ staff and students.
Like Stonewall, we know that people perform better when they can be themselves.
By being a Stonewall Proud Employer, we are taking action as part of Britain’s leading employers' programme for LGBTQ+ people, to ensure that all lesbian, gay, bi and trans staff are accepted without exception in the workplace.
Between 2005 and 2025 Stonewall ran the Workplace Equality Index (WEI) which was the UK's leading benchmarking tool for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace.
The WEI enabled employers to assess and improve their LGBTQ+ inclusion practices across key areas including employment policy and practice, training and community engagement.
This was used alongside the results of an anonymous staff survey to determine ranking.
The university applied to the index in 2019 ranking at number 72 in the list of top 100 employers and more recently in 2024 where we placed at number 14.
The university’s LGBTQ+ Equality Champion is Julie Fryatt, Director of People, who represents concerns relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality at the University Executive Board.
Following the 2024 results of the Workplace Equality Index where the university ranked at 14 out the top 100 employers, the university will be using feedback from Stonewall to inform a new LGBTQ+ action plan, which will build on and enhance work which is currently being done to support LGBTQ+ inclusion across the university.
Ensuring equality for our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff is a key priority for the university.
Our commitment is high profile and we actively support a number of campaigns across the city as part of this work.
As part of our commitment to achieving LGBTQ+ equality, the university aimed to rank within the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index Top 100 by 2020–21 and exceeded this goal by being placed 72nd in the 2019 WEI and reaching 14 in 2024.
The LGBTQ+ Action Plan Group will continue to oversee our LGBTQ+ equality work and our institutional action plan will be updated to reflect feedback from Stonewall on areas where progress is needed to achieve best practice.
Action plans for our Stonewall WEI and LGBTQ+ equality work will be published here as they become available.

The university has further evidenced its dedication to disability inclusivity by signing up for the Disabled Students Commitment.
15 May 2025
The Disabled Students Commitment (DSC) is a national initiative focused on improving support for disabled students in higher education.
It offers a framework for disability inclusion at every stage of the student lifecycle, with 29 practical objectives for universities that cover everything from choosing a course and applying through to life after graduation.
What sets it apart is its institution-wide approach to inclusion.
This isn't just about disability support services; it's about changes across the board that help embed inclusion in the culture and operations of the university.
Around a third of Brighton students (32%) tell us that they're disabled, neurodivergent, or have a long-term health condition.
It’s not enough that disabled students can access the university; they need to know that they belong here.
The DSC offers us both a framework and accountability to make meaningful changes, like reducing the admin burden for disabled students, improving communication practices, and making support easier to access and navigate.
Annie Beckett is a Disability Support Services Manager at Brighton and a Director of the National Association of Disability Practitioners (NADP).
Annie recently attended the launch of new guidance from the Disabled Students Commitment Advisory Group at the Houses of Parliament.
She said:
"The launch of this guidance comes at an opportune time at the university, as we're in the process of signing up for the DSC.
With 32% of our students telling us that they have a disability, are neurodivergent, or have another condition, it's vital that our processes reflect their needs.
The event was a great opportunity to collaborate with colleagues across the sector, including MPs, representatives from the Office for Students, and HE sector leaders."

New sentences found on https://brighton.ac.uk/about-us/your-university/sustainability/what-we-do/index.aspx:
At the University of Brighton, we are working hard to continually improve the sustainability of our campuses, from implementing our net zero strategy and embedding sustainable practices, to increasing biodiversity, encouraging sustainable travel and implementing a university-wide environmental management system.
Find out more about our practices below:
Net-zero
The university has committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The 2023–24 academic year has seen a 45.6% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions against a 2009–10 baseline.
This reduction has been achieved through a range of projects, including installing solar panels, rolling out energy-efficient LED lighting, and developing a state-of-the-art data centre.
The university’s Net-Zero Strategy 2022–2025 sets out the guiding principles for how we will approach carbon reduction.
The university has committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and is in the process of identifying a suitable, sustainable plan for achieving this.
The strategy has a focus on decarbonising our buildings, with three key themes:
Renewables
More than 1,600 solar panels are installed across our campuses which generated over 630,000 kWh last year (2023–24).
This resulted in cost savings of over £180,000 and reduced our annual carbon emissions by over 130 tonnes.
The solar arrays at Grand Parade and Varley were installed through an innovative collaboration with Brighton Energy Co-operative – a community energy organisation whose members invest to develop renewable energy systems in Brighton and the south-east.
We have also installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the Huxley building in Moulsecoomb.
Sustainable buildings
Our campuses are home to a wide variety of building types, ranging from old 19 th century buildings to tailor-made new builds.
As set out in our Net-zero strategy 2022–2025, construction and renovation projects will give priority to fabric efficiency, energy efficiency and on-site generation, consistent with Passivhaus and Enerphit design standards to enable the transition to zero carbon forms of heating.
Installation of more efficient lighting at our Aldrich and Falmer libraries is saving 48 tonnes of carbon a year.
The recent replacement of metal halide floodlights at Falmer Sports pitches with new LED luminaries is expected to reduce energy use and the associated carbon emissions by more than 50%.
Heating and ventilation is a significant contributor to a building’s carbon footprint, which is why we’ve implemented a range of initiatives to lower this impact.
As outlined in our sustainability and environmental policy statement , designs for new and refurbishments of existing buildings will be guided by our goal of achieving net zero carbon usage.
Our construction and refurbishment operating procedure sets out our targets and strategies to achieve this.
Green IT
With IT equipment playing an integral role in the work of a modern university, we’re working hard to ensure our IT services are run as sustainably as possible.
A key success has been the development of a state-of-the-art water-cooled data centre on our Moulsecoomb campus, providing energy-efficient housing for current and future departmental servers.
With a significant number of computers across our campuses, the installation of power-down software has played a key role in minimising the carbon emissions of our IT systems.
The software ensures that all computers are automatically powered down when not in use, avoiding energy waste.
Embedding sustainability
We’re striving to embed sustainability throughout all our practices.
Our university’s approach to engaging students and staff is framed by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), influencing our teaching and learning, research, public and community engagement, and campus operations, in collaboration with the Students' Union.
Sustainable curriculum
At our university, sustainability is seamlessly integrated into all teaching and learning through Research-Informed Teaching.
This innovative approach combines learning with research skills and knowledge exchange, encouraging students across disciplines to explore Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).
ESD in our courses and modules is reviewed through the Annual Quality Assessment process led by the quality leads of the Quality and Standards Department.
ESD approaches and qualitative impact are also overseen by members of the Global Challenges Leadership Group.
Visit our Global Challenges and research and knowledge exchange pages for more insights.
Our campus serves as a 'living lab' for sustainable development, addressing Global Challenges.
Our Net Zero Carbon Management strategy utilises university buildings for research and teaching, exemplified by first-year Architecture, Technology, and Engineering students exploring low-carbon retrofitting techniques.
Additionally, our People and Nature Plan enhances graduate skills through real-world, paid environmental surveying opportunities, boosting employability in biodiversity conservation.
Changemaker Challenge
In December 2024, the university ran the first Changemaker Challenge.
This was a one day hackathon where students worked in interdisciplinary groups to explore approaches and solutions to real world challenges.
A brief was set for each of the four Global Challenges (Equality and Inclusivity, Creative Sustainable Economies, Wellbeing and Climate Change) and students worked collaboratively to address their briefs.
Students delivered a presentation to an external panel made up of experts, local businesses and community partners.
Strategy for student and staff engagement
Our strategies set clear objectives and milestones for engaging both students and staff, monitored through the Sustainability and Environmental Policy statement 2022–25 with annual updates.
Regular sustainability surveys assess behaviours, awareness, and performance among university stakeholders, detailed further in our governance and policies.
Aligned with our Net Zero Carbon Management strategy , the university aims to shift commuter transport towards mass transit, walking and cycling.
Annual travel surveys guide efforts to enhance active travel options.
Every term we offer free bike maintenance sessions for students and staff ensuring their bikes are safe when cycling and encouraging safe travel to the university .
Recognising the impact of scope 3 emissions, we lead by example with a variety of events and campaigns that engage students and staff, promoting wellbeing and sustainable choices in daily life to reduce scope 3 emissions.
The most recent campaign, in April 2025 focused on reuse.
The 'Spring Clean Campaign' was conducted on the reuse platform Warp It, where staff were encouraged to sign up and declutter their workspace by uploading their unwanted office furniture and equipment to the platform to ensure they are rehomed and reused instead of disposed of.
As part of the campaign a competition was run to see which departments and member of staff were able to successfully declutter their workspace through Warp It.
Staff were also encouraged to use Warp It to get second hand items from colleagues in the university or other organisations instead of buying new.
This saves procurement costs, decreases disposal rates and reduces scope 3 emissions.
Go to the Reuse section below to see how much our staff have saved so far.
Staff and students stay up to date with Sustainability events and campaigns through the university's internal news channels - My Brighton and StaffCentral.
So far this academic year (2024–2025) the team have promoted a wide variety of events.
The following are our most popular events each month:
During mandatory staff induction days, our sustainability team introduces new staff to our sustainability policy, responsibilities, and sustainable travel advice.
We provide training and community networking opportunities to drive sustainability outcomes and uphold social responsibility.
Student Inductions
Sustainability is one of the four core values of the university and is therefore an important part of students inductions.
Students are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the sustainability policy and what it means for them during their time at university.
Students are signposted to where they can stay up to date on upcoming sustainability events, such as tree planting, conservation opportunities and bike workshops.
We encourage students to get involved in evaluations.
Every year, sport and health sciences students complete the Planetary Health Report Card (PHRC); a student-led initiative where they use a metric-based tool with support from their teachers to evaluate how well planetary health is addressed in their course and institution.
Research
The University of Brighton has a long, rich and diverse history in making a transformative difference to society through research and knowledge exchange.
We aim to meet the major challenges the world faces, building a sustainable future for our planet in numerous ways:
Our work breaks boundaries, bringing together diverse disciplines, international partners and individuals from academia, industry and beyond.
Through our collaborations and partnerships, we share our insights, solve practical problems and shape debate towards creating a better future for all.
Visit our research and knowledge exchange pages to find out more.
Partnership
The University of Brighton actively works with community groups and organisations to help our local communities to thrive, and to improve teaching and research.
We work together to solve problems and develop working relationships that help local communities and the university in the long term.
Our Community University Partnership Programme (CUPP) creates sustainable partnerships, helps develop ideas into projects, provides start-up funding and helps networks and communities of practice develop.
The university’s award-winning Green Growth Platform supports Sussex’s thriving green sector through business support, innovation and research and development support, events, and opportunities for skills development, delivered by a team of industry experts, business advisors and university specialists.
The university's Sustainability Team support local community partnerships throughout the year on small scale projects, including Brighton and Hove Food Partnership, Surfers Against Sewage and the Brighton Bike Hub.
Waste and recycling
Our aim at the University of Brighton is to promote a zero-waste culture of ‘rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle’, in order to significantly reduce waste and increase recycling across all areas of the university estate.
The university is working towards its waste and recycling goal of 60% by 2025.
This means reducing packaging; cutting down paper use; reducing and recycling food waste; facilitating staff to share surplus resources internally and with local organisations; running the annual reuse project in our halls of residence, and investing heavily in recycling facilities across our campuses.
What happens to waste on campus?
Our mixed recycling is collected by The Recycling Partnership, who sort the recyclable materials into individual material types before being reprocessed.
General waste is taken to a transfer facility for inspection before being taken to the Energy Recovery centre where it is incinerated to generate electricity to power local homes and businesses.
Glass is taken to the glass recycling facility where it is crushed, cleaned and sorted by colour.
Food waste is collected from University of Brighton halls and catering areas.
It is then transported to an anaerobic digestion plant where it is processed to produce a biogas and bio fertiliser.
Biogas helps to produce renewable energy to power our homes and businesses, whilst bio fertiliser is an essential ingredient in farming and is spread on fields to help crops grow.
Re-use
At the University of Brighton, we work with charities to redistribute and reuse any surplus furniture, electrical equipment and office consumables, through Warp It.
The platform allows our staff to easy loan or give items they no longer need to colleagues.
If the items are not required within the university, they will be passed onto our partner organisations and charities.
By spring 2025 we have saved £254,448 and avoided generating 26,445 kg of waste.
This is the equivalent of saving 124,080 kg of CO 2 and planting 169 trees.
Furniture that is not reusable is recycled.
The items are carefully broken down and materials separated for recycling.
At the end of each academic year we run our successful re-use project, where we partner with the British Heart Foundation to encourage students moving out of halls to donate their unwanted items.
In 2024 our students donated 592 bags, helping to raise £8,880 for the British Heart Foundation and diverting 4.7 tonnes of waste.
Supporting sustainable travel
The university encourages active and sustainable travel to and from our campuses and supports avoiding the need to travel by using online meetings or conference calls, supported by the university's Agile Working Framework.
Our campus travel plans outline the actions being taken on each campus to encourage use of active and sustainable travel modes and include:
Our Moulsecoomb campus plan is accredited to Modeshift STARS Good (Bronze), recognising effective development, implementation and monitoring of the travel plan.
The university is also a member of the Southeast Communities Rail Partnership’s, Sussex Downs Line Steering Group.
The groups connects communities to their railways along the line between Seaford and Brighton, encourage travel by train and engagement with the railway.
Further information on all student initiatives and travel information can be found on the student travel options webpage.
Business travel and offsetting
University employees travelling for business are required to consider how and if they need to travel for business purposes, to support the university’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions.
Colleagues are required to:
These commitments are outlined in the university’s Expenses Policy, where travel costs will not be reimbursed if the policy is not adhered to.
Under normal business circumstances, colleagues will be discouraged from taking flights between mainland UK destinations, unless this prevents colleagues with disabilities or caring responsibilities from travelling, or the flight is part of a connection with an overseas flight.
Colleagues can also book use of an electric car or van for inter-site or local travel, supporting emissions reduction.
Colleagues can find more information about working off campus on the StaffCentral SharePoint pages , including:
The university does not currently support offsetting as a means of reducing carbon emissions, and instead promotes investment to reduce operational emissions.
Offsetting will be required to meet our net-zero target but will only be used to offset unavoidable emissions after all feasible reductions have been made.
This approach is outlined in the university’s Carbon Offsetting Position Statement.
Travel survey
Our annual travel survey asks students and staff about their travel habits to the university.
The survey results are used to inform development of travel facilities and initiatives across the campuses, monitor progress towards our travel targets, and inform development of our travel plans.
View the results of the 2024 Travel Survey .
Biodiversity
We strive to preserve and protect natural habitats and biodiversity on our campuses, creating new opportunities for wildlife on campus wherever possible.
In addition to nurturing local habitats, our biodiversity work helps create a better environment for the university community, promoting staff and student wellbeing and increasing enjoyment of our campuses.
The university has developed a People and Nature strategy with the School of Applied Sciences that includes biodiversity initiatives such as:
Falmer Library: Gardening Project
The Falmer Library Gardening Project is a staff-led initiative that began in 2023 with the aim of transforming a run-down allotment space on campus into an outdoor community hub that both staff and students can enjoy.
To kick start the project staff donated seeds and plants and the Sustainability team supplied peat-free compost and a greenhouse to ensure the allotment can be tended to all year round.
The site now has wildflowers, a vegetable patch, a fruit bed and a mixed bed which includes a mature bay tree.
In Spring 2025 a Gardening Club focus group was established to share best practice among colleagues, and ideas to further develop a welcoming and vibrant community for garden lovers across campus.
For the 2025–2026 academic year the Gardening Project aims to grow a wider variety of fruits, vegetables and herbs that when ready can be harvested and taken home by staff and students to enjoy.
The project also hopes to engage more staff to help build community, connect with nature and support wellbeing.
The Dye Garden
The Dye Garden was created in 2014 by both staff and students predominantly from the School of Art and Media, with the aim of starting an academic project that would support staff and MDes Textiles research.
Having been a build site for many years, the ground was compacted and the first summer was spent manually digging into the chalk to prepare for the project.
It quickly became a success and over ten years on in 2025 the garden continues to grow a range of plants that are used for extracting pigment to make into ink for use in creative practices in the school.
This year the beds are being developed further so the garden can produce a wider range of dye plants and larger quantities of key colours, such as woad, madder and weld which produce blue, red and yellow retrospectively.
Student-led Projects
Students from the School of Applied Sciences have undertaken butterfly, hedgehog, and bird surveys to help develop an ecological appraisal of our Falmer campus and inform our People and Nature Plan.
2025 is the third year the student-led project has been run and continues to be supported by the university through the offer of guidance and training from the School of Applied Science’s ecology unit and through the provision of funds to support three students over three weeks.
Hedgehog Friendly Campus
The hedgehog is one of Britain’s best known and loved mammals, yet they are in trouble with a 75% decline in numbers in some areas since the year 2000.
University of Brighton students and staff have collaborated to attain Silver Hedgehog Friendly campus certification.
The scheme aims to raise awareness of the plight of hedgehogs while taking practical steps to improve habitats and circumstances for hedgehogs across university campuses.
There are a variety of ways students and staff can get involved from installing log piles and hedgehog houses, running social media campaigns, to writing blog posts, litter picking and taking part in campus hedgehog surveys.
For 2025/26 the University aims to achieve Gold certification to further promote biodiversity and help protect a vulnerable species.
More information is available on the Hedgehog Friendly Campus Blog .
Chalk Grassland
As part of the university’s ongoing commitment to enhancing biodiversity and sustainability across its campuses, students, staff, and volunteers from the Sussex Wildlife Trust’s Wilder Communities team came together in early 2025 to restore and protect the chalk grassland at its Falmer campus, an essential local habitat.
The hands-on conservation project focussed on controlling invasive species and ensuring that the chalk grassland remains a thriving haven for both wildlife and the local community.
Falmer’s chalk grassland is part of the Westlain Plantation, designated as a Local Wildlife Site by Brighton & Hove City Council.
These sites are some of the most important wildlife habitats in Sussex, and the restoration effort aims to protect this rich and diverse ecosystem, ensuring its survival for years to come.
Estates and Facilities Management hold EcoCampus Platinum accreditation in recognition of work done to embed environmental sustainability, compliance and processes across the department through an Environmental Management System (EMS).
The EcoCampus scheme helps universities and colleges to improve sustainability performance by offering a flexible, phased approach to implementing an EMS.
An EMS monitors an organisation’s environmental strengths and weaknesses, for example by ensuring compliance with relevant legislation.
This allows institutions to manage these risks and reduce impact on the environment.
The Platinum accreditation recognises that the university has implemented an operational EMS; that we are identifying and managing our significant environmental aspects, setting environmental objectives, managing environmental compliance, and evaluating and improving our environmental performance.
We have an up-to-date Sustainability and Environmental Policy Statement to which the EMS is aligned.
The EMS implementation team are also working on a road map to assist our schools and other departments in developing their own environmental management systems.
The university is committed to ensuring the sustainability of our campus food and drink outlets.
We use locally grown fruit and vegetables when in season, sustainable fish and higher welfare meat.
Our food offer includes a range of vegetarian and vegan options, catering for various dietary requirements.
Our sustainable food commitments are outlined in full within our Sustainable Food Policy (pdf), which covers all food outlets and food served by the university, referred to as Food on Campus.
The university also provides spaces for staff and students to grow their own local sustainable produce in allotments at our Falmer and City campuses.
My Cup is the university’s reusable cup scheme, encouraging staff, students, and visitors to ditch single use cups either by using their own or purchasing a Huskup Cup from one of our outlets.
We also introduced a disposable cup levy where customers must pay an extra 30p for every hot drink they buy in a disposable cup.
The menus in our Food Hubs have been carefully designed so that production is cooked to order, helping to minimise any food waste from the kitchen.
We also plan the portion size of the meals to ensure that plate waste is kept to a minimum.
Used oil from our fryers is collected by a local company for recycling and used for biodiesel.

You can hire or purchase items – some recipients may wish to purchase one item and hire others.
Please ensure that you have clearly indicated your preferences when ordering.
It is important that recipients who choose to use the Graduate Gowning Company's facilities and are eligible to wear a hood should do so, as this is unique to the University of Brighton and denotes the level of your award.
What should I wear under the gown?
The graduation ceremony is a formal occasion and you should wear something appropriate for such a special occasion.
In general our graduands choose to wear a suit and shirt, smart trousers or skirt and shirt or blouse, a smart dress or national dress under their academic gown.
We advise you to choose something that is comfortable to wear under an academic gown whilst walking across stage and up and down stairs.
Please note that the university reserves the right to refuse a student to collect their award in person at the ceremony if their dress is deemed inappropriate, such as fancy dress costumes.
Where do I collect my gown from on the day?
As the robing area can get busy about 45 minutes before each ceremony, we recommend that you collect your gown as soon as possible after registration.
Pins are provided to secure your hood, either at the shoulders or by the loop at the front; you may find it useful to wear a buttoned shirt or top so that the loop can fit over the button.

What happens on the day
Morning ceremony
Afternoon ceremony
Registration and ticket collection Recipients must arrive between the times stated above and enter via the seafront entrance of the Brighton Centre.
Go first to the registration desk where you will be given your seat and guest tickets.
You will then be directed towards the gowning area.
It is important that you register upon arrival as requested because recipients without a seat ticket may not be able to receive their award.
Upon arrival, please look out for our helpful stewards, who will be available throughout the venue to assist you and your guests.
Stewards will be easily identifiable in purple gowns and stationed in key areas.
Recipients are seated in reserved blocks in the centre of the main auditorium.
You may take your seats from the time that the auditorium doors open but you must be seated by 9.35am at the latest for the morning ceremony and 2.50pm for the afternoon ceremony.
It will assist stewards if you remain seated once you have taken your place.
What happens if I arrive late?
We ask that you arrive in good time, as we cannot delay the start of the ceremony.
Those arriving after 9.15am for the morning ceremony or 2.30pm for the afternoon will be considered late and will normally be called at the end of the ceremony, rather than with their cohorts, and may not be able to participate.
Guests On arrival at the Brighton Centre, guests will also enter via the seafront entrance.
Guests do not have numbered seats and are permitted to sit anywhere except the recipients’ block in the centre of the main auditorium and a few reserved seats.
Children will find the balcony area especially good for viewing although the ceremony is relatively long (approximately an hour and a half) and not suitable for young children.
Due to health and safety restrictions at the venue, prams and buggies and large bags cannot be taken into the main auditorium, however they can be left in the cloakroom free of charge.
The ceremony Recipients are seated in the auditorium alphabetically in school and course order.
Guests sit separately.
A steward will ask you to stand and will direct you to the backstage area, where you will be checked on a list and directed to the side of the stage.
You will be called across the stage in formal recognition of your achievement, receive acknowledgement from the Vice-Chancellor before exiting the stage and returning to your seat.
It is difficult to estimate, but we would expect the ceremony to last about an hour and a half.
Once you are seated you are not normally permitted to leave the auditorium.
As a courtesy to other recipients and guests we ask that once the ceremony has started you remain in your seat until the ceremony has finished and the platform party have left the auditorium.
Please note that the end of the ceremony includes loud music and flashing lights and therefore could potentially trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

Asbestos register
The asbestos register made available here relates to buildings under the control of the University of Brighton that are known to contain asbestos containing materials (ACM).
Typically, these are buildings constructed and refurbished before year 2000.
After year 2000 asbestos containing materials were generally known to no longer be available on the market in the United Kingdom.
However, any person undertaking construction or maintenance activities on our premises is expected to have completed an asbestos awareness training course and be able to identify those materials that are likely to contain asbestos.
In all circumstances if material is suspected to contain asbestos then its true nature must be ascertained.
All ACM can only be worked on or removed with the consent of the Asbestos Manager.
The Asbestos register information is primarily based on Management Surveys compliant with current guidance issued by the Health and Safety Executive.
In some circumstances the results of Refurbishment Surveys have been included as there is a strong presumption that materials identified in these surveys are present in similar parts of the building.
In all circumstances a Refurbishment Survey must be considered before any refurbishment of a building takes place or changes are made that are likely to affect the fabric of building.
The Asbestos Manager must be consulted.
Should any party have any query regarding the asbestos register information or in regard to asbestos on the university’s premises then please contact the Asbestos Manager, Edwin Underwood.
Essential information

FAQs
Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)s are a part-funded government programme, awarded on the basis of a successful application.
At the University of Brighton, we’re proud to hold a 100% success rate in securing funding for our partners.
Government funding via Innovate UK covers up to 67% of the total cost of a KTP project for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, (businesses with fewer than 250 employees), with the business contributing the remaining 33%.
For larger companies (250+ employees) and public sector organisations, projects are up to 50% funded.
Third sector and charity organisations can access funding of up to 75% of the total KTP, contributing just 25% themselves.

Ted, 75, who helped to organise the UK’s first Gay Pride march in 1972 before becoming a leading light in the gay and British civil rights movements, will be presented with an honorary doctorate on 1 August at the University of Brighton’s Summer Graduation.
The award recognises his impactful activism and social justice campaigns spanning more than half a century.
Widely credited for inspiring generations to demand better through his tireless advocacy, creative protest, and unwavering resilience, Ted joined the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) as a teenager and campaigned with the group for LGBTQ+ rights.
His work with the GLF helped to lay the foundation for what is now Pride in London – a movement of defiance, joy, and solidarity that continues to draw over 1.5 million people annually.
“I never imagined that standing up for who I am and for what I believe in would become what it is today,” said Ted Brown.
Born Theodore York Walker Brown to Jamaican parents in New York, his activism has consistently intersected with issues of race, gender, media bias, and structural injustice.
Ted Brown with his honorary doctorate
Ted Brown (left) with Peter Tatchell (right) at the end of Pride March in Hyde Park, 1973.
Ted helped stage the now-iconic "kiss-in" protest in London in 1972, publicly confronting the criminalisation of same-sex intimacy.
He later co-founded Black Lesbians and Gays Against Media Homophobia in 1990 as a direct response to the media’s racist and dehumanising treatment of footballer Justin Fashanu, the world’s first openly gay professional player.
Despite suffering a brutal attack for speaking up, Ted also successfully campaigned against the violent homophobia in reggae artist Buju Banton’s controversial song, Boom Bye Bye, which the singer later publicly disowned and refuses to perform.
Ted said: “To be recognised by University of Brighton, not just for the march or the moments people remember, but for the long road it took to get here, means everything to me.
The university’s values of courage and equity truly reflect the conviction behind everything I do.
And now, many years later, I feel very proud to receive this honour thinking about all those who came before me, stood with me and continue fighting for their rightful place in this world.”
Professor Donna Whitehead, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Brighton, said: “Ted Brown has not just shaped British civil rights history, he has helped to write it.
As our city prepares for Brighton Pride this weekend, it’s clear that Ted has changed this country for the better.
His lifelong commitment to fairness, visibility, and justice reflects the very values this university stands for.
We are honoured to celebrate his legacy and to learn from the example he continues to set.”
The award, an honorary Doctor of Letters, will be conferred on the final day of the University of Brighton’s five-day Summer Graduation ceremonies at the Brighton Centre where more than 3,000 students from 97 countries will receive their degrees and other awards.
This year’s graduates range in age from 19 to 76, reflecting the university’s commitment to opportunity, inclusivity and lifelong learning.
The event will celebrate Ted’s transformative impact across the UK and beyond, a legacy built not on fame, but on fearless conviction and selfless advocacy.
Left to right: Ted Brown and Professor Andrew Lloyd
Alongside Ted, the university will also confer honorary degrees on three other outstanding individuals whose work embodies the university’s values of inclusivity, creativity, and positive social change.
Accessibility consultant Steven Misfud MBE and cultural advocate, Philippa Aldrich will each receive an honorary Doctor of Arts degree while Alan Larkin, a Brighton-based legal innovator and educator, receives an honorary Doctor of Laws award.

You can contact us at: awards@brighton.ac.uk .
Replacement certificates
To apply for a replacement certificate, you will need to download and complete the application form (pdf) in its entirety.
Along with the form, you should also include a form of photographic identification and make a payment of £40 via the online shop .
Please remember that a confirmed payment alone does not constitute a successful application.
Your request will only be processed once we have received the fully completed application form and the necessary photographic identification.
Ensure that the completed application form reaches the Academic Registry, as we are unable to follow up on incomplete applications.
Once your application is accepted, a new certificate will be printed and sent to you by recorded delivery.
Please note that this process can take up to 28 days from receipt of your application and cleared payment.
Any certificate not collected at the presentation of awards or sent to a confirmed postal address within five years will be destroyed and a replacement will need to be ordered via the online shop.
If you studied a degree course before September 1992 and after 1965, your award was validated by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) and not the University of Brighton.
The CNAA is no longer in existence, but the Open University holds its records and offers a validation service.
Please go to the Open University website for information on how to proceed.
The university can supply verification letters confirming your award.
Please contact the university if you would like a replacement certificate in this category.
We will check our archives and let you know what we are able to produce for you.
Edexcel (BTEC HNC/D) certificates awarded 1994 and after
The university can only supply duplicate Edexcel or BTEC certificate from 1994 onwards.
To apply for a replacement certificate, you will need to download and complete the application form in full, ensuring it is signed by the relevant certifying authority, before returning it to the Registry department, having made the appropriate payment via the online shop, where it will be reviewed before proceeding.
Once your application has been accepted, we will print a new certificate which will be sent to you by recorded delivery.
To apply for a replacement Edexcel (owned by Pearson) certificate prior to 1994, you will need to go to the Edexcel website and complete the application form or call 0345 618 0440.
Unless you are still local to Brighton, it is probably easier to go to a solicitor and ask them to make copies of your certificate and certify that it is an accurate copy of the original.
However, should you wish the university to certify your certificate; you must post it back to us by recorded delivery and pay £10 for five copies.
Please send your certificate and make the appropriate payment via the online shop.
Other verification services
We can provide a letter of verification confirming your award and the dates you studied with us.
This will be printed on headed paper and stamped for authenticity.
If you require a copy of this document please make the relevant payment via the online shop and we will aim to return the documentation to you within two weeks.
If you graduated in 2001 or after, you can obtain a copy of your academic transcript which lists the modules you took and the credits you achieved.
If you require a copy of this document please make the relevant payment via the online shop and we will aim to return the transcript to you within two weeks.
If you graduated before 2001 we are unfortunately unable to supply transcripts.
However if you send an email to awards@brighton.ac.uk (providing your name, date of birth and address to which you would like the documents sent) we will send you a letter with the dates you studied, confirmation of your award and a copy of the prospectus page which details the breakdown of your course.
Third party verification
We regularly receive enquiries from third parties regarding evidence of your qualifications, however in most cases the Data Protection Act strictly prevents us from disclosing information.
There are some circumstances where disclosure would be allowed – for example to a criminal investigation agency.
In addition, you could consent to information being shared – for example to supply a reference to an employer or agency.
There is a new system that the university is using which is called Higher Education Degree Datacheck ( HEDD ).
This is an online verification service for employers and agencies which verifies the University of Brighton awards.
Please note, this service is only for use by third parties such as those verifying your qualifications for a job or for further study.
The system has been developed by Graduate Prospects, in consultation with universities, employers and screening agencies.
HEDD is being used by many institutions throughout the UK.
We recommend that you encourage third parties who require verification of your qualifications to use this system because it is a quick, easy way for them to obtain the information and most organisations are already registered on the system.
We would suggest that in the first incidence they ask to see your original degree certificate where this is available.
The online candidate verification service requires registered enquirers to input data which you will have to provide (your name, date of birth, course and qualification, year of graduation and degree result).
You will need to have completed a consent form which the third party will have to upload in order to give us permission to release confirmation of your qualifications.
This consent form helps us to ensure that you are aware of the data share, have consented to the data share and that legal authority is in place to allow for the data share.
It also helps to source and find the exact information requested.
Our alumni remain firmly part of the university community and as such are eligible to continue to use our facilities and have access to exclusive offers.

Download our house-hunting guide
The private rented sector refers to properties and rooms that you rent from another party; private rented accommodation is either let by private landlords, letting agencies, or private providers of privately owned residential halls.
Shared housing
Students most commonly live in shared housing.
It makes rent and bills more affordable, offers a fun and sociable environment, and you can share responsibility for keeping communal spaces clean and tidy.
There are lots of letting agencies in Brighton & Hove that advertise student properties.
You don’t need to know all of them, there are a range of private websites that advertise properties from a selection of agencies so everything you need is in one place.
You may wish to look at reviews and testimonials of letting agencies through external review websites, Google or the agency’s website.
Private landlords manage their properties and tenancies directly rather than using a letting agency.
Private landlords will either advertise the property themselves, or a letting agency will advertise the property on their behalf but the property and tenancy will be managed by the landlord when the contract begins.
Private landlords may be more flexible or open to negotiation.
Many shared student properties are rented as whole properties on joint tenancies, you will need to enquire as a group for this type of accommodation.
Sometimes properties are not let as a whole, and bedrooms are let separately to individuals.
Studios and 1-bed flats
If you wish to live alone or move in with a partner, studios and one-bedroom flats will probably be most suitable.
This type of accommodation is widely available, and it is advertised on a range of websites.
Although not always the case, you typically secure studios and one-bed flats much closer to the move-in date compared with shared student housing, often 1-2 months before you intend to move in.
Studios and one-bed flats are usually a more expensive option, particularly if you plan to live alone.
Therefore, you may also want to consider accommodation in the surrounding areas of Brighton as the accommodation may be more affordable.
There are many discounts available for students on public transport to assist with commuting to university .
Private halls
Private halls refers to purpose-built student accommodation in a residential halls layout.
There are a range of private halls throughout Brighton, managed by private providers.
Options such as en-suite bedrooms in shared flats and self-contained studios are typically offered in this type of accommodation, and there will usually be communal areas and recreational facilities in the buildings for residents to enjoy as well.
Please note that private halls are not affiliated with the university, and any agreement entered into will be completely private.
Lodging
Lodging is a type of accommodation where you rent a room or self-contained living space in someone’s home, and the landlord lives in the same residence.
This type of landlord is called a “resident landlord” or “live-in landlord”.
Lodging is an affordable and home-like option for short-term and long-term stays, depending on what you want.
Bedrooms are often fully furnished and ready for you to move into, and sometimes you can share the household cookware and crockery, too.
Lodging offers a great opportunity to familiarise yourself with the area while searching for long-term accommodation, or as a comfortable long-term solution.
Where to look
You can search for accommodation using the sites listed below.
This list is not exhaustive, but it provides a good starting point of widely-used websites.
You can filter your search on these websites to ensure the search results meet certain criteria.
For example, you can filter the price, radius, number of bedrooms etc.
Each individual property listing will show who is advertising it and instructions on how to enquire.

Budgeting
If you are entering an assured shorthold tenancy, your security deposit must be protected by a tenancy deposit protection scheme.
Your landlord/letting agency must tell you which scheme your deposit is protected by.
The above information is based on our own market research.
Calculate an average monthly cost by multiplying the weekly amount by 52, then dividing the new sum by 12
The above information is from Save The Student.
Guarantors
You will probably be required to provide a guarantor when applying to rent a property in the private sector.
The purpose of a guarantor is to guarantee rent payments.
If you fail to pay rent, your guarantor will be asked for payment.
Most students ask a relative or friend.
A person must meet certain criteria to act as a guarantor, this will vary across letting agencies and landlords.
If you do not have a suitable guarantor, some agencies and landlords may accept use of a guarantor service instead.
A guarantor service is a paid service that provides rental guarantee insurance during your tenancy.
Paying for rental guarantee insurance through a guarantor service ensures that a landlord will receive payment if the tenant defaults.
Similarly to other insurance policies, tenants will have to meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for the service, such as passing reference checks, providing a deposit and providing an eligible co-signer.
See some guarantor services listed below:
Another alternative to a guarantor that may be accepted is paying rent upfront.
A commonly accepted payment schedule is six months upfront, with a second payment of the remaining amount after six months.
Sometimes the full rental amount for the tenancy period will be requested upfront.
Not all agencies/landlords will accept this instead of a guarantor.
If you plan to use a guarantor service, or suggest an upfront payment in place of a guarantor, we advise that you check whether this will be accepted in your initial queries, before viewing a property, so that you don’t waste your time.
Private landlords and residential landlords may be more open to negotiation regarding guarantors.
Council tax
When you move into private accommodation, you need to register your household for Council Tax.
You can register for Council Tax with Brighton & Hove City Council online.
After registering, you can then apply for any applicable discounts you and others in your household are eligible for.
Full-time students are exempt from paying council tax.
You can register for student Council Tax discount online.
You can find out more about other available discounts online.
Tips on renting safely:
Be aware of online scams such as the use of money transfer services like Western Union or Money gram.
Money transfer services are not meant for any kind of transaction connected with someone you don't know.
The university accepts no liability arising from the use of any website and what you do with the information here is at your own risk.
The university disclaims all express or implied conditions, representations, and warranties of any kind, including any implied warranty or condition of satisfactory quality or fitness for habitation.

The three-year programme is made up of two 31-week years and one 30-week year, totalling 92 weeks.
Attendance pattern may vary dependent on modules undertaken.
We are a member of the Association of Advanced Practice Educators UK (AAPE UK) which provides national guidance on ACP education.
This relationship will aid in future-proofing the contemporary value and quality of the programme.
With support from the employer, apprentices are required to spend 20% of paid working hours on studies and be able to evidence this.
This is a statutory requirement for apprenticeships and the funding is conditional on this being met.
Off-the-job learning includes activities which have not previously been a part of the role or furthers apprentices development into new areas.
Modules and core skills
Teaching and assessment
The programme is based on multi-professional teaching and learning within a spirit of enquiry and the active co-production of knowledge amongst staff, apprentices and students, in learning, teaching and research.
Learners on the programme are partners with lecturers facilitating an interactive learning community.
A blended learning approach will be facilitated through My Studies which provides learning resources specific to individual modules, and access to the Brighton Skills Hub and the online library.
The development of the electronic portfolio over approximately two years, provides apprentices the space to explore their role and discover how they are meeting the apprenticeship standard.
Summative assessment methods are used throughout the programme including:
The Managing Complexity in Advanced Clinical Practice core module provides an e-Portfolio framework for the mapping of the Institute For Apprenticeships for Advanced Clinical Practice standards.
These capabilities are assessed over approximately a two-year period.
Clinical skills and simulation rooms provide an invaluable tool for assessment and monitoring apprentices' progress throughout the course.
Apprentices benefit from practising skills in an environment that simulates real-life professional experiences.
Learning by simulation with state-of -the-art mannequins enables apprentices to practice in a safe environment under supervision, so they can apply their knowledge and skills in professional practice with confidence.
The Flexible Learning Environment is an adapted home environment in a residential location where apprentices are able to practise skills and learn from others while taking part in realistic training scenarios.
Every room is fitted with cameras and microphones, so that apprentices can be directed and mentored from the control room while the observation room provides the opportunity to review, playback and debrief.

I lead the Aerospace Engineering course at the University of Brighton and my expertise is in experimental aerodynamics.
I love teaching students about the physics of flight, flight dynamics and aircraft design.
Students engage in a variety of activities to enhance their hands-on experience and connect their learning to real-world engineering.
In our labs, students conduct wind tunnel experiments to explore aerodynamics and test their design concepts and perform computational fluid dynamics simulations to deepen their understanding of fluid behaviour and its applications in engineering.
These experiences not only enrich their education but also demonstrate how their learning directly applies to the field of engineering.
Students also have opportunities to get involved in my research on renewable and sustainable energy.
Recently a group of students analysed wing design modifications experimentally and numerically as part of their major team project.
What I enjoy most about teaching at undergraduate level is fostering a deep understanding of the fundamentals of aerospace engineering in students by research- and practice-informed teaching.
Witnessing their growth as they grasp complex concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios is truly rewarding.

Areas of study
A core value of our course is ‘learn in the doing’ and we bring an explicit, practitioner-focused learning approach to developing your craft knowledge as you journey towards being an effective practitioner
We want you to gain confidence in your ability to interact with clients, design and conduct exercise testing, explain physiological responses to exercise and training and prescribe effective exercise interventions.
In taught physiology modules, you’ll experience and discuss the responses of the human body to various stimuli, including acute and chronic bouts of exercise, environmental changes (using our thermal and hypoxic chambers) and ergogenic aids which can be used to simulate peculiar clinical conditions and help you better understand human physiological responses and ultimately the benefits of exercise in healthy and clinical populations.
Our commonly used ‘solution to the problem’ approach to learning and teaching integrative physiology will help you to develop a host of laboratory skills while providing guiding principles to apply to any exercise physiology situation you encounter in the future.
Most of our modules are taught in our sport and exercise science laboratories where you’ll learn to be a practitioner of tomorrow.
With Personal and Professional Development, you’ll also gain vocational skills to give you a competitive edge in the job market.
Placement opportunities and chances to network in the world of exercise physiology will ensure you graduate with a foot firmly in the industry.
You will spend around 100 hours with one or more organisations related to the practice of exercise physiology which will allow you to apply your academic knowledge in an applied setting.
We use lectures to introduce themes around emotional intelligence and ethical and moral dilemmas in the workplace and seminars as a teaching vehicle for you to reflect on your experiences and hear the experiences of others as you develop to being a practitioner.
To complement the physiology you’ll learn, the client and your safety as a practitioner are discussed from a health and safety and risk stratification perspective, but also with awareness towards the ethical implications.
This is an important feature as you move towards your own research project where you’ll embark upon a project that links to your chosen employment route.
You will be able to choose to write your research project up as a dissertation, a research paper or a case study report; some of our past students have published their own work.
Your ability to work with data and illuminate the meaning by using different statistical approaches is another important feature of the course and we will guide you to be able to use a range of concepts and techniques on physiology data you collect.
During this module you will develop the critical awareness, knowledge and skills associated with physiological assessment, including health and safety, equipment, test types and physiological profile determinants.
The module is heavily based on practical demonstration and hands-on experience, and considers measurement reliability, accuracy and sensitivity when testing the exerciser.
You will work in small groups on pre-designed experiments and problem-solving.

David Sheahan
“After completing my BA(Hons) degree in Exercise and Health Studies, I built up substantial knowledge in both the sporting and clinical environment.
My first role on completion of my undergraduate degree was as an exercise and health specialist.
This role involved both clinical metabolic testing and sport performance education within the secondary school setting.
“It quickly became apparent that due to the nature of the industry I would have to further my education to progress my career.
With a keen interest in both exercise prescription and clinical testing, an MSc in Applied Exercise Physiology seemed to be the perfect fit.
“I began to research universities and narrowed down my choice to either Loughborough University or the University of Brighton.
From the information gathered and discussions with past pupils via the online chat within the website, I got a great sense that the Brighton course was the perfect fit.
For me personally, I wanted an environment where students weren’t just seen as another number, that they had a voice and that there was a sense of community within the course cohort.
From my own experience I can confidently say the exercise physiology course and the university lived up to my expectations, with the state-of-the-art laboratories, outstanding standard of lecturing and high success rate of employment upon completion of MSc degree.
“With the MSc degree occurring in the height of a pandemic, the university and course leaders adapted superbly to maintain their high standards of education, putting protocols in place to allow students to continue practising exercise and clinical testing in a controlled and safe environment.
This valuable practical experience has allowed myself and my peers to gain employment during and upon completion of the MSc degree.
“During the course I developed a keen interest in respiratory physiology and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, in which I had limited knowledge of prior.
With the quality of laboratory equipment and lectures I was able to gain valuable experience using the best evidence practice.
This enabled me to secure a part-time role during my MSc degree as a respiratory support worker and more recently a role as a respiratory physiologist.”
Ellie Noble
“I completed my BSc(Hons) degree in Sport and Exercise Science in 2020 at Brighton and throughout my degree I took a strong interest in physiology and working practically.
From this, I decided to gain more knowledge and experience in this field by undertaking the MSc in Applied Exercise Physiology.
“The course developed me as a scientific practitioner by offering the ability to work independently and grow both professionally and personally, but in an environment where support was always there if needed.
The course structure taught me in-depth physiological knowledge across a variety of disciplines, such as environmental physiology, exercise testing with patients and clients and clinical physiology.
“The facilities offered are exceptional, the Human Performance Laboratories have both a hypoxic and heat chamber with a range of scientific and clinical equipment.
This allowed practical hands-on experience throughout the year, with encouragement to use these resources independently out of teaching hours.
“The staff are incomparable, with their background knowledge and teaching skills, whilst consistently being supportive and assistive in creating tailored scientists in this career field.
The course helped me gain experience clinically, which has now led me into my career as a Cardiac Physiologist at Southend Hospital.
My strong background of physiological knowledge and experience from the course helped me to secure this role, which I am loving, helping patients, working practically and continually learning.
“I recommend this course without hesitation to anyone, not only the strong course structure and delivery but also due to the extraordinary staff, facilities and opportunities that Brighton has to offer in developing individuals into great practitioners.”
Ramona Tinei
“When I decided to study an MSc in Applied Exercise Physiology at the University of Brighton, I knew it could only be on a part-time basis due to working full-time in London.
“During my first semester I knew I made the right choice by choosing to study and upgrade my skills at the University of Brighton because of the supportive staff and incredible facilities, where amazing projects are taking place all the time in the labs and the students have the opportunity to be involved from the start and expand their interest and knowledge.
“The course structure encourages independent learning, paving the path I chose, evidenced in all my clinical case studies which allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of cardiac physiology.
The course reassured my choice in the field of clinical physiology and it has given me the confidence to take a leadership role as a Regional Clinical Fitness Lead helping developing cardiac rehabilitation phase 3 and 4 as well as working as a Rehab Specialist for Nuffield Health.
“I am now working towards CPET accreditation, keeping my main goal of becoming a physiology practitioner.”
Greg Wright
“During my undergraduate degree, I knew I wanted to go on to specialise in physiology.
I chose to study Applied Exercise Physiology MSc as it was one of the only courses that allowed me to combine work with both clinical and sporting populations, helping to make me a well-rounded practitioner.
From talking to the lecturers, past students and visiting the university, I knew this was the place where I wanted to study.
“Coming onto the course, I was nervous as I had not had much experience performing laboratory assessments.
All the staff, and my fellow students, were very supportive and took the time to help me learn the many new techniques that I can now perform with ease.
I strongly value having a good relationship with my lecturers and being able to go to them with anything.
I don’t think I could have found a more accommodating or helpful group of individuals if I tried.
“I was keen to get as many work experience opportunities as I possibly could to enhance my personal and professional development, including: running heat acclimation sessions for athletes training for the Marathon Des Sables, sport science support at Eastbourne Borough Football Club, nutritional support for athletes and the general public, and exercise rehabilitation assistant for cancer patients.
I also had the opportunity to work with Paralympian David Weir in the run-up to the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.
Additionally, I was able to collaborate on a PhD project.
“I never would have imagined going on to study for a PhD before starting this course, which is testament to the fantastic way this course, and the staff, encourage you as an independent learner.
As such, I would highly recommend this course.”
Chanel Coppard
“Going into the Applied Exercise Physiology MSc, I knew that I would only be able to do it on a part-time basis due to work commitments.
However, the incredible staff and facilities meant that I did not want to study anywhere else, and so from 2016–2019 I learnt many new techniques in the laboratory and had the opportunity to collaborate on a PhD project for my dissertation.
“The course structure encourages independent learning, whilst being a highly supportive environment.
As a part-time student commuting weekly, this helped my development as a researcher immensely.
Although it was intense, I still had freedom over my research avenues and could structure my time spent at university to get the most out of lectures, tutorials and lab sessions.
“Part of the reason I chose the programme was because I wanted to work with people affected by chronic illness to get their version of normal back after treatment.
Through the MSc, I realised that there are a multitude of ways to do this, such as furthering research in an academic setting or directly working with clients in a healthcare setting.
“I wouldn’t have thought either of these avenues would have been open to me without completing this MSc and so I would recommend this course to anybody without hesitation.”
Charlotte Avery
“After completing the Sport and Exercise Science BSc at the University of Brighton I had a strong desire to continue my studies, particularly focusing on physiology, due to my positive experience in my undergraduate degree and the focus the university has on employability.
I discovered that to increase my chance of employability, postgraduate study was preferred for my career aspirations of becoming an Exercise Physiologist.
“I chose to continue my studies at Brighton due to their focus on practical learning and choice of modules offered, allowing you to create a degree that is designed for you.
The variety of assessments has improved my communication, confidence and written work to build a good foundation as a practitioner.
The placement module is a huge highlight which offers you the opportunity to put the skills you have learnt into practice and to help you determine if this is a career path you aspire to.
“A further highlight is the opportunity to be taught by experts within the field.
The lecturers are passionate about their area of study and are keen to pass on their knowledge through engaging lectures and published material which they have written themselves.
For my dissertation I worked with my tutor closely to create an original and unique topic, which excited me to complete my final piece.
“Even after all the knowledge and skills I had learnt from the course I still was apprehensive about finding a job.
However, the university brought in several guest speakers who were insightful and helpful.
From this I signed up to a locum agency to work as a cardiac physiologist and in a few weeks of finishing my course I was employed.
If you are looking for a masters degree that challenges you intellectually, lecturers who are supportive and passionate, and to increase your opportunities after study, then this course is for you.”
Ellen Davies

Rob Walton
“After completing my BSc(Hons) degree in Sport and Exercise science at Brighton it was a simple decision to continue my education at such a great university with facilities of the highest quality.
“I chose the MSc in Applied Sports Physiology route due to its wide variety of modules in both Sport Science and S&C fields.
It is a very applied course with ample opportunity to work within the labs, replicating real-life scenarios that may occur in future careers – this is also supported by assessment topics being self-picked to allow students to focus on sports or areas that they feel are relevant to them.
“The course content, along with the staff involved in delivering it, helped me push myself to become the practitioner I am today – developing my own philosophy and more importantly teaching me the fundamental skills I now need and use in my career.
“The applied nature led to me working as the first team sport scientist for Eastbourne Borough FC, with the Reflective Practice module having an influential role in me gaining this position.
This led to me gaining an internship with Cardiff City FC academy which has now progressed to employment at the club as a lead Sport Scientist.
I am also working towards gaining CASES accreditation and have aim to complete my UKSCA accreditation in the near future.”
Will Hayler
“I spent three years studying at the University of Brighton and loved every minute of it.
I developed a strong passion for physiology due to numerous lab-based learnings and great facilities on offer.
The staff were excellent and had some expert knowledge to pass down to us.
Upon graduating I knew I wanted to work within elite sport and I ended choosing between the Sport Physiology and Strength and Conditioning MSc at Brighton.
“I opted to go down the Sport Physiology route despite having a strong interest in S&C as I felt the course would allow me to develop as a scientist by advancing my physiological knowledge.
However, I knew if I wanted to work in sport, having good scientific knowledge would only get me so far and that I would need to have a good practical understanding of how to coach athletes.
The Physiology MSc was great in the fact it allowed me to tailor the course to suit my needs by being able to study some S&C modules.
“I feel one of the best aspects of the course was the huge emphasis that was placed on personal and professional development.
Alongside the course, I was undertaking an internship as a strength and conditioning coach at Crawley Town FC and the course helped me to reflect on my experiences during my internship to develop into a sport science practitioner.
“I am currently applying my knowledge and skill set as a strength and conditioning coach at a company called Go-Perform, a sports performance and rehabilitation centre, whilst further working towards the UKSCA accreditation as I aim to achieve my goal of working in a team sport.”
Mitch Raynsford
“I knew from college that sport science was a career avenue I wanted to pursue, therefore from 2013 I spent three fantastic years completing the Sport Science BSc.
Straight away I took a passion to applied lab and field-based learning, simultaneously developing a great rapport with the academic staff.
“The Applied Sports Physiology MSc advanced my knowledge, skillset and confidence to the next level in a context-driven environment that supported career pursuit.
I spent a huge period of my year in environmental chambers researching deeply into the effects of neuromuscular fatigue on performance.
“The strong focus on professional development allowed me to take on a role as a strength and conditioning coach for Eastbourne Hockey Club, whilst networking with a wide array of practitioners across the width and breadth of the UK.
“I then took a role at the University of Warwick as a strength and conditioning intern for two years, a few weeks before the course finished.
This led smoothly on to me becoming the physical performance lead with Aston Villa Ladies RTC 2020 where I am currently based.”
Carla Randall
“During my BSc at the University of Brighton, I really enjoyed the applied side of physiology and dealing with real-life clients – in performance analysis, strength and conditioning, exercise testing and environmental physiology.
An MSc was the next logical step.
“By studying part-time, I could continue my professional development, carry out CASES Supervised Experience and gain experience applying my knowledge and skills.
With opportunities to support academic research, elite sport and external clients, I maintained my work experience at the LTA High Performance Centre.
“Coursework could be tailored, and a report-style dissertation was a valuable option.
With great facilities and tutors readily available, their support really helped me publish my first journal article, which was subsequently featured in US Men’s Health and Runner’s World.
“I went on to provide sport science support to professional and semi-professional middle-distance runners – during that time there was an increasing demand for race analysis.
This led to supporting several GB athletes competing at junior- and senior-level major championships, including the World Championships and the Olympics.
“I now provide race analysis and scientific support through my online business, track analysis, alongside project support for organisations including British Athletics.”
Carla graduated with an Applied Exercise Physiology MSc , companion course to Applied Sport Physiology.
“After completing my sport and exercise science undergraduate degree at the University of Lincoln, I moved and enrolled at Brighton.
“The course developed me as a scientist by teaching me in-depth physiological knowledge across a range of disciplines, from clinical to environmental physiology.
I really enjoyed the strong practical nature of the course which I felt developed me as a practitioner and enabled me to apply what I have learned in the real world.

Graduate view
Matt Reed, graduate
My main project focused on augmented reality and its use in the lived environment.
I had no previous experience using this technology before beginning the course, and my project work opened this door for me, creating a new area of interest.
It used AR and is a free-to-use public artwork that allows people to travel back in time using augmented reality technology via time portals.
My course leader and personal tutor was instrumental to my success in the course.
She really helped me to explore my own interests and helped me to develop my ideas, and I’m very grateful for that and the confidence it has given me to take my ideas forward.
I really enjoyed the course and I highly recommend it, especially for someone looking to do something a bit more experimental within the field of architecture.

In semester 1, two modules run alongside Design Studio: Building and Environment and Architectural Humanities.
In semester 2, one module, Future Practice, runs in parallel.
Year 2 modules are also formed of three elements.
Design encompasses the whole year through the masters Design Thesis.
Alongside this, the Design Research Practices module is aimed at introducing you to research methodologies and practices, and is taken with masters students from other design disciplines in the school.
In semester 2, you will develop self-directed research based on your interests arising from your design work in the Architectural Research Specialisation module.
In this module you will develop strategic knowledge and understanding of the connections between of environmental science, structural systems, material performances and detailed design development.
You will apply the knowledge gained from lectures and seminars to your design project.
Lecture topics may include environmental, structural, computer aided design, performative modelling and component production and material design principles.
In this module you will integrate the skills, knowledge and understanding of professional practice developed during your degree and Stage 1 professional experience with your current MArch work.
You will use design projects to test the regulatory, financial and professional controls applied to a specific project and examine the future role of the architect and the future forms of architectural practice.
In this module you will join one of a number of research-led design studios that critically engage with contemporary issues.
You will be introduced to and develop a research-based approach informed by your studio’s agenda.
You will apply this to develop a brief and design a comprehensive architectural design proposal which integrates material, environmental, sustainability, user and structural considerations.
In this module you will complete a self-directed research study through which you will develop a specialisation which reflects your wider design practice and aspirations.
You may choose to define your topic in ways that complement your work in Design Thesis or build on insights from other modules you’ve studied.
The form of the study will be developed in discussion with your tutor and peers to suit the specific topic and method.
Working within a research-led design studio, you will develop a self-directed research-based design thesis in this module and explore it through a complex architectural design proposal.
You will evolve and use a comprehensive range of visual, oral and written media to test, analyse, critically appraise and explain the design proposal.
The proposal will integrate material, environmental, structural, constructional, user and sustainability considerations.
Year 1: Strategy
We see the first year of the course as an evolution of your current skill set to embrace a critical engagement with design.
The design studio laboratories will ask you to engage with a research-based approach to a generation of design strategies and architectural proposals, and to critically reflect upon your developing conclusions.
An understanding of the core principles as well as an introduction to new technologies and environmental concerns associated with building is supported through the technology thread of the course.
In the module Architectural Humanities you will be asked to place your own work in relation to significant contemporary positions in architectural design practice and theory, building an awareness of the political, disciplinary and professional concerns and agendas that drive it.
Further testing and exploration of your design proposal by regulatory, financial and professional controls will build on your skills, knowledge and understanding of professional practice.
This will enable you to critically examine the future role of the architect and future forms of architectural practice.
Year 2: Integration
A self-directed research-based design thesis develops throughout the final year of the course.
This offers you the opportunity to deeply explore your own architectural position informed by your design studio laboratory’s research agenda.
Visual, oral and written media will be used to test, analyse, critically appraise and explain the final design proposal.
You will be assisted in developing an integrated and independent approach to design research as the new research thread of the course expands on your methodologies and practices.
Teaching
The course is centred around the studio and through this aims to reflect the nature of architectural practice.
Teaching is rooted in problem-based learning, such as through critical studio briefs, and a research-based approach to problem solving.
You will therefore be asked to critically engage with and reflect upon the subject matter and to learn through your own research and enquiry.
One-to-one tutorials, group discussions, seminars as well as lectures by academic staff and visiting practitioners all act to assist in evolving your ideas.
The studio laboratories are derived from the tutors’ own field of enquiry as academics or practitioners.
You are given the opportunity to apply for the studio laboratory of your choice at the start of each academic year.

“In the Business School the first year is very general and so that gives you a fantastic opportunity to be able to get to know as many people as possible.
Then it becomes more specific to the specialism that you select.
I chose marketing; there were two modules dedicated to marketing in my second year and three in my final year.
The further you go, the more you focus on what you’re interested in, which gives you an incentive to really stick by the course.
“I feel as though I am more in control of my education than I was in college, not only because of the course that I chose but how I manage my time too.
Outside lessons there’s lots of material that you can use to keep up and it’s a huge benefit to have that access.
And if you’ve got a different style of learning then there is some way that the university will be able to accommodate you.
“In terms of inclusivity and diversity, I’d definitely recommend Brighton.
Everywhere you look you’re going to be seeing somebody from a different part of the world – it has an international flavour.
“The experience of going to a society and being able to meet new people all whilst you’re doing your studies, that’s been the most transformative aspect for me.
I’ve been part of the Asian Society and the Debate Society and was able to make new friends with folks who I met within those societies.
“I’ve also got more of an understanding of group work, because I hadn’t really had that experience of working with a group for a project in college; this was my first taste.
It’s made me realise how practical my course is.
Working as a student ambassador has also given me new skills because you’re working with young people, you’re working at events doing tasks that you wouldn’t normally do.
Those skills are easily transferrable and add to my experience.”

Listen to a podcast with course leader Dr Jess Moriarty where she discusses the role of fiction in self-expression and personal wellbeing, a previous ‘Big Read’ book and sharing a moment with her former student and honorary graduate Munroe Bergdorf.
“I have already gained so much from the Creative Writing MA and I attribute this – almost entirely – to the exceptional teaching staff.
They consistently dedicate their time and energy into engaging each individual student based on their unique skills and interests.
The quality of my writing, as well as the approach to my practice, has improved exponentially.
“The Communities of Practice module has empowered me to utilise my writing skills to effect positive change within my community.
The joyous guidance and encouragement I’ve received from Jess Moriarty throughout has been invaluable and is being used to great effect in and outside my studies.
Her wealth of knowledge and infectious enthusiasm has really pushed me to reach my potential.
I’m proud to use my writing to help a cause I’m passionate about, and I feel inspired and excited about what’s to come.”
“I undertook my writers residency as part of my MA in creative writing.
The challenge was to become embedded in a community to both stimulate writing and creativity in place as well as to be inspired to write something amazing myself.
“Community is a multi-faceted term and can become a rabbit hole of discussion about communities of place, communities of interest and communities of purpose.
I stepped back and followed my own interest in liminal spaces – the spaces in between where there is a sense of unpredictability and increased possibility.
“This led me to negotiating and becoming a writer in residence at Oval tube station in south London.
I embarked without fixed expectations – more a sense of curiosity.
I spent many hours sitting in the tube station, observing the ebb and flow of people.
It was at Oval where the famous Thought of the day board was initiated, and the station staff have a strong pride in their station.
They were endlessly interested and welcoming of my presence.
“I devised a project called Return Journey as a means of encouraging members of the public to engage and reflect.
I designed a large mock rail ticket and asked people to record their answers to the question, If you could return to any tube station, at any point in your past, where would you go, when and why?
Through this I collected stories which collectively are micro tales of human love.
Transport for London are currently designing these into large posters, which they will display at the station.
“I then wrote a collection of prose, reflections and poems entitled Fieldnotes at Oval Tube, in which I explored how people behave in this liminal space and how our minds can be expanded.
This experience stimulated rather than satiated my fascination with liminal spaces.
So when I saw the website for The Liminal Residency I was spurred on to apply for a place on one of their writers residencies.
I was interviewed, accepted and consequently spent an intense weekend with five other writers at Heathrow Airport.
“Our collective writing in response is now published in an anthology and can be found on www.liminalresidency.co.uk .”

James Field, winner of PQ Magazine’s Accountant of the Year Award 2014
“I thoroughly enjoyed my time studying ACCA qualifications at Brighton and put down much of my success to my time there.
“I always enjoyed the interaction in the classroom, meeting like-minded people, making friends, bouncing ideas of each other and working as a team.
Since a successful career in accountancy involves a high degree of interaction with colleagues and clients, I feel these softer skills are as important as the academic ones taught in the classroom.
“I liked the discipline and routine of the classroom.
Being someone who can get easily distracted I knew that to remain focused I needed to be somewhere where I was away from such distractions and in an environment that would get my full attention.
“During my time on the course I was always impressed with the standard of teaching.
Most of the tutors have clearly worked in the industry and I always found their life experiences and stories to be most useful as they helped me to better understand and visualise the theory.
“I found the pace at which the course is taught to be well balanced in that it catered for students of all abilities.
The tutors were also always keen to help, whether in the classroom or on a one to one.
“Furthermore I believe that much of my success is down to the fact that at the university you are not simply taught to pass exams – as is often the case with other learning providers – but to fully understand and comprehend the subject matter.
I honestly feel that this deeper understanding helped fine-tune my skills and gave me the confidence to have the strength and conviction to put forward suggestions and ideas to my board and to see through any such proposals.
“For anyone thinking of studying at the University of Brighton, the above average pass rates for the ACCA exams and its Gold Approved Learning Provider Status are both testament to the pride taken in ensuring that every student not only develops the skills to pass exams, but is suitably equipped for the challenges that lie after.
I, for one, acknowledge the large part the university has had to play in my career and my recent success at the PQ Awards.”

In year 1, I attended a nursery in Whitehawk for my observational study where I was in the pre-school room for 10 hours – five hours on Thursday and five hours on Friday.
“I am now in my second year and currently on a five-week placement in a setting where I would like to go into after graduating.
I have chosen a primary school, more specifically a reception class, and am really enjoying the experience.
The staff are really supportive and the children want me to stay forever!
“When I graduate from this course my plan is to do a Primary PGCE as I would like to become a reception teacher in the future.
“If you have a passion for working with children from birth to five and reception age then you should apply for this course.
It is not all theory based and unlike other courses there are placement opportunities so you can use what you have learnt and see it in practice.”

“I had already worked in nurseries before studying and was able to continue working part-time.
This has greatly helped me to apply the learned in practice, to experiment and assess my provision.
“I have had great experiences in student collaboration at university.
We motivate each other, are not shy with compliments and appreciate each other’s strengths in various areas.
I also love learning about how the environment the child lives in impacts the child in various ways.
“The uni has very experienced and knowledgeable tutors and lecturers.
I feel personally supported as our course consists of a small group of students, therefore there is plenty of opportunity for personal interaction with our tutors.
“After graduating, I am thinking of studying a further year for a teacher’s degree.
Then, I aim to combine my knowledge about holistic health and early years education and care, and possibly start a business!”

I enjoyed observing practitioners interacting with children and this experience was made worthwhile because there was a good balance of adult-led activities as well as child-initiated play.
“The course has taught me about good practice in early childhood education settings and I feel more confident to challenge anything that is contrary to what I have learned especially when it comes to safeguarding children.
I believe it has also prepared me for my future career.”

There was more background knowledge to discover, and more freedom in research-based learning, offering me the chance not just to look at education within a classroom but in other aspects.

There is no one definition of education!

Dr Cliff Dansoh , course leader
I have spent most of my life in industry.
Having started in the Royal Navy and then through a range of consultancy roles I have been lucky enough to experience a variety of diverse types of engineering and ways of getting things done.
This journey has impressed upon me the merits of not only being technically competent, but in having the vision and creativity to establish what needs to be done; and the implementation skills, competencies and behaviours to have the best chance of actually achieving the end result.
As we advance technically it is expected that the next few years will deliver societal benefits in diverse areas such as the food chain, water, energy, waste management and health care.
It is clear that studying engineering provides competencies that are not only pivotal to delivering these societal changes, but will also be required in larger amounts.
My advice to students is to explore the wealth of knowledge that exists and strive for excellence during your time at the university.
I would also advise you to be kind.
Kindness and decency in how you deal with others in delivering projects can be just as important as your technical ability.

Taylor Reehag
“I have always been interested in storytelling, writing my own since I was about eight or nine, with the goal of eventually publishing.
I am a strong believer that you should always do what you’re passionate about, and for me that was this.
“Most of what I’d studied prior to university had been classical, thus the idea of analysing books that came out only a few years ago really appealed to me.
The range of texts we cover is absolutely a highlight.
It’s really opened my mind to the ways other people live and write.
“Within creative writing, the workshops have been so useful.
Sharing my writing and reading other people’s has been so important to my growth as a writer and a critical reader.
It’s also helped me understand what I want for my future and how to get there.
“The course team are so friendly and they always want to help you improve yourself.
They don’t just teach you, but really engage you in the seminar discussions and push you to come up with your own ideas and arguments.
“The environment is so welcoming.
I always feel like I can voice my opinion, which has been great for establishing ideas and analysis.”

“I’m enjoying the versatility of the modules and the lectures are really varied and fun too.

“I love Brighton as a city as it is such a welcoming and colourful place and of course the university seemed like a perfect fit even though it meant moving down the length of the country!”
Anya Moore
“Literature has been my passion ever since I was young; I would bury myself in giant books (Christopher Paolini’s works come to mind) and practice my creative writing on the weekends on my mum’s old computer.
What started out as merely a hobby or escapism has now paved the way for me to someday become a librarian or even a lecturer myself – both careers where I can give back to children or young people like myself who are developing their own passions.
“The course has expanded so much of my knowledge I’d already been collecting since A Level.
It has helped me develop my sense of self as a writer and my technical and analytical skills so much.
“Both seminars and lectures are very conversational and it feels easy and safe to speak your mind.
The resources required for lessons are simple enough to access online and are always provided in advance.
“The course team are incredibly welcoming.
They are a very friendly bunch who are often open to helping with pastoral as well as academic issues; you are even assigned a personal tutor at the beginning of the year to help direct you to the right resources that may benefit you.
“English Literature and Creative Writing is a very passion-driven course; it feels best to experience if you can find joy and excitement in every assignment and keep your mind curious.”

"Although I have always been really interested in the topic and have experience working in healthcare, I have no biomedical background, and was worried this would be a hindrance.
However, I am so glad I went for it.
The course is structured in such a way that you get an excellent foundation regardless of your prior knowledge, and then you can build on this.
There is plenty of scope to really explore your personal areas of interest, and all the lecturers and tutors are so supportive, friendly and approachable."

Jayde Matthews:
“I was looking for a course which covered wide-ranging topics and dealt with important issues.
I knew I wanted my research to contribute to understanding the world’s issues and this course had the added bonus of including weeks on feminist thought and women’s rights which had been my pre-existing area of interest.
“I was also drawn to the varied option modules available with this course, but it was after meeting the course leader at a postgraduate open evening that I knew this course was for me – the most important thing was learning from people who are not only experts but are also passionate about what they are teaching.”

Health promotion pathway
The Health Promotion pathway is our most popular route and offers the widest choice of option modules.
It requires no previous experience of study or work in health promotion practice, so is suitable if you are changing career and need to develop and strengthen your expertise and knowledge of public health.
If you are already working in public health and want to develop both your knowledge of education and management theory and practice, this pathway would enable you to take modules from both the management and education strands.
As well as the core modules, you will take:
International pathway
The International Health Promotion pathway provides an opportunity to learn through comparison.
You will compare and contrast how context influences the way that health promotion operates in your home and host country.

The community placement module volunteering is carried out in a country other than your own – for international students this would be a UK placement.
Your dissertation may include strong elements of international comparison such as examining what happens in your home versus your host country.
A global or cross-cultural option module (20 credits) such as:
Management pathway
The management pathway expands your capacity to work at a managerial level in health promotion.
You should have a high level of pre-existing knowledge, experience and competence in health promotion as you will take most of your modules from the management strand.
Your dissertation will be on an aspect of health promotion of your choice which includes a management perspective.

Education pathway
The Health Promotion and Education pathway is for practising health professionals who wish to gain skills, knowledge and behaviours to be an effective leader of education within practice or for academics who wish to work in a healthcare education context.
It is for you if your expertise and job roles include, or are expected to include, a strong curriculum design and delivery of education to other health or allied health professionals.
To study on this pathway you’ll need to have experience of and/or have studied health promotion and have previous experience of delivering teaching or training courses to health professionals or other colleagues in practice.
Students on this pathway share modules with health professionals studying for our PGCert in Leading Practice Education .
UK students will be able to gain formal recognition as a D2-Fellow under the UK Higher Education Academy Fellowship scheme.
Fellowship of the UKHEA is increasingly recognised as an alternative to a PGCert in employment in higher education.
Full-time/part-time
Full-time
Students studying full-time tend to take three modules in each of the two teaching semesters and work on their dissertation from June to September.
Part-time
Many of our UK-based students study part-time to fit alongside their work and home commitments.
Typically, part-time students take three or four modules in the first two years and complete their dissertation in their third year.
This gives students plenty of flexibility and time to identify a suitable community placement and to work on their dissertation.
Who this course is for
Our students come from a wide range of backgrounds.
Some are professionals already working in public health or wellbeing roles and some have an interest in health and wellbeing and are looking to develop this further to find employment in the health improvement sector.
The course is ideal for those working in roles which include a health promotion component who want to deepen their knowledge and theoretical understanding and have an opportunity to develop a research or specialist area.
Our students include health and wellbeing advisers, practice nurses, social care professionals, pharmacists, school teachers, personal trainers and voluntary workers.
We also welcome professionals looking to change careers and follow their interest or passion for aspects of health and wellbeing.
Backgrounds in marketing and communications and counselling are particularly suited to health promotion.
The course offers a strong career progression for recent graduates in degrees which examine people, populations and behaviours (including psychology, sociology, social geography, marketing and  communications) or which already include elements of health promotion such as pharmacy or the sport sciences.
Students with other academic backgrounds are also welcome but will need to demonstrate relevant voluntary or other practical experience.

Force plates or force platforms are instruments designed to detect forces and movements applied to their top surface.
Traditionally they are used to assess forces during walking or running.
They are a very versatile piece of equipment and can be used to measure a number of other effects such as balance.
By using custom-made jigs, their usefulness can be further extended; for example they can be used to measure forces applied during manual therapy.
The Cartesian Opto-electronic Dynamic Anthropometer ( CODA ) is a three-dimensional movement-measuring system developed over the course of the last 20 years by Charnwood Dynamics Limited.
The CODA has been used for a wide range of three-dimensional analysis applications and is now an accepted method of determining the spatial and temporal parameters of movement.
The system allows rapid and accurate measurement of human movement using lightweight markers attached to the skin.
Fastrak is an electromagnetic tracking system suitable for measuring human movement.
The system comprises up to four sensors whose position and orientation in space can be monitored in real time.
Clinical and research applications include monitoring the range of movement of joints, evaluating sitting or standing posture and monitoring the transition between the two, for example the sit to stand movement.
Xsens is another instrument suitable for measuring 3D human movements and is based on inertial sensor technology, for example miniature accelerometers and gyroscopes.
It is relatively small, light and very portable and can therefore be used outside the laboratory setting, such as in homes and offices.
Electromyography (EMG) is used to measure the activity of muscles.
Electrodes are placed on the skin over the muscle to be measured and the electrical activity of that muscle is recorded.
This data can be used to look at the time at which the muscle turns on and off, the amount of electrical activity it is producing and whether the muscle is becoming fatigued.
The isokinetic dynamometer can be used for muscle and joint function assessments for either performance or rehabilitation purposes.
Having initially been developed for rehabilitation purposes, isokinetic dynamometry is one of the safest forms of exercise and testing.
The isokinetic dynamometer measures muscular torque during isolated joint movements.
Ultrasound is used for the scanning of soft tissue structures within the body.
Originally developed for foetal scanning, it is now used for scanning a wide array of structures including internal organs, muscle and joint structures and nerves.
It utilises high-frequency sound waves which pass into the underlying tissues and reflect back to produce an image of the underlying tissue.
F-Scan Insole system is used for studying foot pressure.
Electrogoniometers are designed for the measurement of joint angular movements.
The sensors are attached across the joint with double-sided medical adhesive tape.
The joint angles can be stored or displayed using various pieces of equipment.
The sensors and instruments are lightweight, allowing data of human activity to be displayed or recorded while leaving the subject to move freely in the normal environment.
GAITRITE is used for studying walking patterns.
The Vibrameter is used to assess the nerve conduction of specific sensory nerve fibres.
It is often used in a clinical setting to test for conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome or repetitive strain injury (RSI).
A probe is placed on the area to be tested and a vibration stimulus is produced, the subject is asked to let the operator know when they first feel the sensation of vibration.
The vibration stimulus is then turned down and the subject is asked to report when the sensation disappears.
Electronic algometer – pressure algometry is well documented in scientific literature as an efficient, objective physical component for evaluating point tenderness, pain syndromes and patients’ pain perceptions.

“Some course highlights which stand out to me are: participating in client interviewing and negotiation competitions and reaching the final rounds in both, my position as a student clinician in the legal clinic and the essay competition which enabled me to undertake a mini-pupillage with a barrister at a One Crown Office Row.
“Another major highlight was the approachability and willingness of academic staff to help students.
I have never felt unable to ask a question or reach out for guidance on an assignment, the staff at Brighton are brilliant and really do make the time for every student.
“During my final year I was a student clinician [in the legal clinic] and participated in different client cases ranging from family to housing issues.
All students are supervised by qualified individuals who will guide and support, whilst leaving the research, interview and drafting elements to the student clinicians.
The role gave me the practical experience I needed and continue to use in my role today.
“Following a successful vacation scheme, I have signed a training contract with a UK top 50 law firm.
This is something I have been striving to achieve since I started in my first year at Brighton.
“In the present, to kick-start my future career after finishing university, I have started as a paralegal/legal assistant in a local law firm.
I secured this role following a work experience placement I undertook whilst in my final year at Brighton.
I am thoroughly enjoying my role and really getting to put into practice all I learnt at Brighton.“

“I chose to study Law LLB(Hons) at the University of Brighton because I have always aspired to be a lawyer, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to change people’s lives.
“Studying at the University of Brighton was straightforward, thanks to the library’s extensive collection of law textbooks that allowed me to explore the subject from various angles.
The lecturer’s guidance further boosted my confidence in my studies.
“Being a student clinician was a rewarding experience.
It not only taught me how to apply the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors and work effectively with other student clinicians, but also allowed me to see the direct impact of my legal knowledge on real clients.
The Legal Clinic module was a valuable opportunity to put my legal knowledge into practice and make a difference in people’s lives.
“In my first year, I won an Award for Excellence for the highest mark overall and a week’s work experience with DMH Stallard.
During my time in the Horsham office’s Family Law Dispute Resolution department, one of my responsibilities was to take attendance notes in client interviews.
“I also spent one week at Monan Gozzett in Arundel — Private Defence False Allegations, where Neal Gozzett made me feel part of the team by immediately involving me in a live criminal case and allowing me to show my abilities to apply the law in a practical setting.
These opportunities allowed me to gain invaluable experience and strengthened my belief that being a criminal law solicitor is my calling.
“This degree, a testament to my dedication and hard work, has truly changed my life.
It is the first solid brick in the foundation of my future career in law.
It has broadened my perspective, enabling me to see every situation from multiple angles, not just from a legal standpoint but also in real life.
“After graduating, I will study the LLM SQE 1&2 online part-time alongside seeking a full-time paralegal job or training contract to fulfil the qualifying law experience and qualify as a solicitor.”

“Studying at the University of Brighton has been the best experience of my life.
I have been able to make friends, join exciting and innovative societies, gain real-world legal experience, learn about many aspects of the law and be part of something bigger than myself.
“For my final year, I was fortunate enough to obtain a place on the Justice in Practice: Community Legal Clinic module, and to choose the Criminal Evidence, and Family Law and Family Justice modules.
I enjoyed these modules the most due to activities like the debate-style workshops and external trips in Criminal Evidence, and external speaker workshops for Clinic and Family Law and Family Justice.
“I was able to take part in the Brighton Legal Clinic.
For this role, I provided legal advice and communicated with clients to create strategies for their next steps or to resolve their legal matters.
I drafted relevant legal documentation to send to clients; for example, client care letters, research reports and letters of advice.
I chose to create a presentation on Victim’s Right to Review as part of the assessment, which gave me a deeper insight into the experience of victim-survivors when the criminal justice system fails to provide a correct outcome.
“My advice to prospective students is to not hesitate to apply to this course!
You will enjoy every moment.
The law course at the University of Brighton is filled with many exciting roles and events, insightful and intriguing modules.

Solicitors qualifying exam (SQE)
The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) introduced the new Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE) on 1 September 2021.
The SRA provides more information and guidance about the transitional arrangements to qualify, so keep checking the SRA website .
On the previous route, to become a solicitor you needed to complete a qualifying law degree (or another degree followed by a Law Common Professional Examination/Postgraduate Diploma in Law), moving on to do the Legal Practice Course (LPC), and then a two-year period of recognised training, usually called a training contract.
The new route is that the SQE will consist of two parts: part one assesses legal knowledge, research and writing; and part two tests practical skills gained after completing a recognised period of training.
We regularly review the curriculum of our qualifying law courses and will make changes as necessary to provide an integrated approach to preparing students for the SQE.

Winner of the SHS Student Prize for Excellence 2017–2018
“The transformational aspect of the PGCert very much applied to my own overall mindset and approach to learning.

“Taking on a student representative role, contributing to clinical teaching in the nursing BSc programme, and the social learning aspects of the course were all key to building an educator identity.
The sum of these efforts in my PGCert journey laid the foundations for trust in my capabilities to take on a practice educator role and design service-led programmes for my clinical area.

The inclusion of formative assignments and the accompanying feedback were vital in order to build clarity and quality in my work, and it was an affirmation to win the School’s Prize for Excellence.

Instead, I truly transformed my way of interacting with learners, changed my view of myself as an educator and saw a passion for quality education grow into something bigger than me.
“Through this course I have helped to make changes to the way undergraduate students are taught whilst with us on clinical placement and this has lead me to a new role within my organisation as lead clinical tutor which I would not have achieved without the education and knowledge I have gained through my time on this course.
“On top of all this, I have met such amazing people and they have become my peers and colleagues in a broader community of practice which has given me a wider horizon –something I was lacking coming from a small professional background.
I would recommend the PGCert to anyone who has an interest in education – it will take that interest and turn it into an ambition.”

Imogen Bobbett
“I chose midwifery as it was a long-held ambition born out of a fascination with pregnancy and childbirth.
“I applied to five universities and was offered a place at all of them – I chose Brighton as it was the most welcoming and the friendliest.
The lecturers are knowledgeable and engaging and visiting speakers add a valuable dimension.
“For my placements I have worked in a community setting, both within a core team and a low-risk, case-loading team.
This latter experience is one of Brighton’s strongest selling points.
It not only gives an excellent insight into the continuity of carer model which fits in with the targets set in response to the Better Births report, it also gives invaluable experience of working in a team, home births and case loading.
“I have also worked within an obstetric unit, antenatal day unit, antenatal ward, delivery suite and the post-natal ward, enabling me to capture the whole neonatal experience with both low- and high-risk pregnancies.
Working at the Eastbourne midwifery-led unit also gave a different perspective on low-risk deliveries away from the obstetric influence.
I also had experience on the gynae ward, special care baby unit and theatres.
“I chose to go on an international elective to the Philippines, which was a life-changing experience, and also spent time with paramedics and the BPAS clinic, together with time alongside the safeguarding and screening midwives.
“This is an amazing course and Brighton has been a brilliant place to do it.
The lecturers really care and are so supportive.
It is really hard work, you can’t go into this half-hearted, but if you stick with it, it is the most fantastic career.”
Amber Bathurst
“After being at the birth of my nephew, I was in awe of midwives and their role and this drove me to start my midwifery journey.
“After going to the open day at the University of Brighton, I felt very welcome and knew it was the university I wanted to attend.
The lecturers at the open day were very friendly and answered any questions I had.
“The most enjoyable thing I have experienced on this course is being able to assist mothers and their partners to deliver their beautiful babies into this world!
This coincides with caring for them in general in all aspects of midwifery and being able to make a difference (if only small) to the care they receive.
“I also case-loaded a lady during my second year at university who was pregnant with her second baby – a special moment because I also delivered her first baby in my first year!
It was lovely caring for her throughout her pregnancy where I also managed to ‘catch’ her second baby too and see her postnatally.
“I have been on placement at Worthing hospital where I spend most of my time on the labour ward or the antenatal/postnatal ward.
We are also able to practice in the community where we undertake clinics for women’s antenatal appointments and then see them at home with their babies for postnatal visits.
Alongside this, we have been able to work in the special care baby unit, theatres and gynaecology as part of our non-midwifery placements which were very interesting.
“The teaching staff have all been amazing.
There are all very supportive, especially a few who I know I am able to contact if I have any concerns or questions about my placement, studies, or life in general.
“My cohort is lovely – there is a mixture of characters, ages and personalities which makes classes fun, and I feel able to engage in lessons and participate because they are all very supportive.
I have made some lifelong friends who I will make sure I stay in contact with.”
Danni Page
“I’ve always wanted to have a career in healthcare, and midwifery was really appealing as I was interested in developmental science and being able to practically apply my knowledge to work.
“At the university we have a home birth and hospital simulation room.

DOWNLOAD THE NUCLEAR MEDICINE HANDBOOK HERE >
This new course, and the first nuclear medicine postgraduate programme at BSMS, draws on the experience of leading educators in the field of nuclear medicine to deliver unique and flexible study in this exciting, expanding and important specialty.
Nuclear medicine is a specialty that involves all applications of radioactive materials in diagnosis, treatment and medical research, with the exception of the use of sealed radiation sources in radiotherapy (WHO definition).
It is a highly specialised and important area of healthcare, which pertains to many areas of medicine across the whole age spectrum from neonatal to geriatric medicine and underpins the management of many cancer, cardiovascular, infection, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.
The practice of nuclear medicine in the UK is closely regulated, with practitioners having to satisfy IR(ME)R and ARSAC requirements to lead nuclear medicine services.
Nuclear medicine specialists therefore have stringent educational requirements to ensure provision of a high-quality service in the UK.
Study at our postgraduate diploma level is designed to address both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine education to satisfy the General Medical Council (GMC) mandated requirements in the training curriculum for nuclear medicine physicians, and the course has GMC approval.
The modular structure of the course allows the learning experience to be tailored to the needs of many others working with nuclear medicine, including: Radiologists/Radionuclide Radiologists, Nuclear Medicine Technologists and Radiographers, Clinical Scientists, Oncologists and Cardiologists.
You can study full or part-time to fit around clinical commitments, with teaching provided online and on-demand, supplemented with online, live seminars and tutorials to facilitate remote study.
Applicants interested in the Nuclear Medicine course are encouraged to begin with module MDM132: Physics, Radiopharmacy, and Regulations , whether studying full-time or part-time.
This module provides essential foundational knowledge of the scientific and regulatory principles underpinning the field and is a compulsory component for those pursuing the PGCert, PGDip, or MSc pathways.
All modules within the programme are also available as standalone options for those seeking Continuing Professional Development (CPD).
If you prefer to take individual modules without committing to a full postgraduate qualification, you are welcome to apply for these separately.
To support a structured and cohesive learning journey, we recommend completing MDM132 prior to any clinical nuclear medicine modules.
It is also advisable to complete MDM133 (Single Photon Nuclear Medicine) and MDM134 (FDG PET-CT) before undertaking MDM129 (Advanced Multimodality Imaging) .
Should you later decide to pursue a postgraduate degree or certificate,  you may be eligible to apply for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) for any modules already completed.
If you would like to apply for a standalone module, you can do so via the BSMS website using the link below:

Each taught module or subcomponent course from the postgraduate programmes (PGCert, PGDip and MSc) can be taken individually and flexibly to suit those with busy work and life commitments.
These can be accredited individually or used to build modules or programmes.
The PGCert and PGDip can be accredited and build towards an MSc.
The time limit for course involvement will be five years.
The programme is open to post-registration doctors involved in nuclear medicine and any healthcare graduates allied to or seeking to further extend their scope of practice in nuclear medicine, including but not limited to: nuclear medicine technologists, radiographers, nurses, clinical scientists, and imaging and non-imaging specialty doctors.

“Before I began my degree, I was a healthcare assistant in nursing homes for nine years.
“When I was told that I was due to have one of my placements in a local nursing home I was over the moon as I knew I would feel confident and comfortable.
“Being on placement in a nursing home is an entirely different experience to being in hospitals – there is a much more homely atmosphere, with incredibly friendly staff who enjoy teaching due to having the capacity to do so.
“I can honestly say that this was one of the best clinical placements I experienced.
On a daily basis I helped with many bilateral leg dressings and wound care, as well as setting up medication for syringe drivers, long-term drains for ascites, venepuncture, catheterisation and meds rounds.
“I think working with the elderly is something that all student nurses should experience.
Their wisdom and life experiences are very humbling and have definitely had a huge impact on the nearly qualified nurse I am.
“My 12-hour shifts in the nursing home used to go so quickly, and there was never a dull moment as there is always a resident that would love to have a chat!
“I made so many friends from this placement and even managed to get myself employment there as a healthcare assistant to support me during my studies.”
Gavin Woodgate
“I can’t quite believe how quickly the three years has passed.
It really does seem like only yesterday I was celebrating the offer of a place on the adult nursing course.

“The University of Brighton has provided the essential support needed to learn clinical skills, whilst also supporting and guiding me in practice.
It’s fair to say I did not regard myself as the most academically minded student but the excellent help and guidance I have received has helped me obtain grades I am proud of.
“I know I will always take the University of Brighton with me whatever happens, it’s where my nursing career began!”

Sabrina Barnes
“I was lucky enough to spend two weeks in Kathmandu, Nepal, on placement in three different paediatric wards: general medicine and surgery, neonatal intensive care and paediatric intensive care.
In this time, I was able to learn how different the Nepali culture was and both the differences and similarities between nursing in Nepal and the UK.
“I was also able to learn a lot about myself and my own nursing practice and share some of my experiences with the Nepali nurses.
I had never travelled alone before, so even before I got to Nepal I had done something new, and when I got there I was able to meet lots of other nurses doing exchange placements from across the world.
This enabled me to learn about other people’s experiences of healthcare and I also met friends that I went travelling with recently to Pokhara, Nepal.
“My experience in Nepal taught me a lot about family-centred care and I have been able to take this in with my nursing practice as a qualified nurse.
In particular, my time on the intensive care unit in combination with my second year placement on HDU inspired the title of my dissertation, which had a focus on supporting family involvement in intensive care environments.”

Occupational therapists need to appreciate the multi-layered benefits of interprofessional working and this will give you the opportunity to explore the different roles and responsibilities of various health and social care professionals.
In this module you will refine the design of a research project related to evidence-based occupational therapy practice.
You will undertake and report on your research and critically reflect upon your engagement in the process to deepen your understanding of research practice.
The main purpose of the research project at masters level is to advance your skills in research design and methodology.
As a Brighton occupational therapy student you will use a range of specialist facilities which will include:

Problem-based learning
Our educational philosophy mirrors the philosophy of occupational therapy.
We believe that an individual’s positive engagement in (learning) activity leads to advanced productivity, increased perception of self-worth, improved quality of life and enjoyment (of the course).
Our occupational therapy degrees use problem-based learning (PBL), a technique recommended by authorities around the world.
All subjects covered are integrated around problem-solving within a real-life situation.
We find that learning in this way significantly increases our students engagement with the subjects.
The pre-registration occupational therapy degree incorporates the experience of doing and making in order to engage with, analyse and develop skills in therapeutic media.
We have creativity studios for cooking, ceramics, crafts and performing arts, and we have developed gardens for the practice of horticulture.
Around the world, many academic courses in occupational therapy are losing this aspect of their education, to give over more time to ‘theory’, but here at the University of Brighton we believe that it is vital to retain these embodied learning experiences – which utterly link theory and practice – as they are indeed central to the understanding of the true essence and potential of occupation.
Recent research has revealed the connection between skilled hand use and the development of thinking.
As one student, who could not imagine a course without these sessions, asked: “How can we learn about doing without doing?” These classes are central to the philosophy of our occupational therapy education at Brighton and they have become one of its hallmarks.
About the profession
Occupational therapists work with children, young people, adults and their families to identify where change might be beneficial to improve health and wellbeing.
Some individuals might experience difficulty with washing and dressing or making a meal, others may find structuring their day challenging or need support to partake in occupations that are meaningful to them.
Skilled and compassionate occupational therapists work closely with people to analyse occupations and devise interventions in partnership with their clients to bring about improvement in such activities.
This could involve demonstrating new techniques or adapting participation to support people to do what’s important to them.
Alternatively, occupational therapists might introduce new activities such as cooking or pottery to enhance wellbeing and enjoyment or improve communication skills and self-confidence.
Occupational therapists believe that humans are creative, occupational beings who thrive when engaged in a balanced range of enjoyable activities.
They seek to understand peoples’ motivations and needs and try to match activities to a person’s existing skills.
Activity analysis exposes that although the things people do may seem simple, human occupations are incredibly complicated.
Occupational therapy is the study of what people do, how they do things, the effect these activities have on human health and the reasons why people choose to do what they do (the meaning behind the doing).
The videos here show occupational therapy graduates Rhys Philips and Troy Croxton in the role of occupational therapy support workers explaining how occupational therapy helps people live meaningful lives and carry out activities of importance to them.
Practice placements
What are practice placements and why are they necessary?
You will undertake four placements of approximately eight weeks, working alongside an occupational therapist in a practice setting.
Placements make up approximately one-third of the course and meet the World Federation of Occupational Therapists requirement that all students complete a minimum of 1,000 hours supervised practice.
The placements will therefore be full-time, which will be approximately 37 hours per week.
Placements provide opportunities for you to develop your professionalism, knowledge and skills under the guidance of an occupational therapist.
Your skill development might be related to many areas of practice including group work, creative activities, mobility, communication and the use of technology.
What type of placement?
You will practice in many different settings including the National Health Service, social care organisations, schools, the voluntary sector, hospital in-patient settings, community settings and mental health services.
Diverse practice placement One of the placements is eight weeks in a non-traditional/diverse setting.
This can include collaborative projects with community organisations including homelessness day centres, hostels, residential and nursing homes, physical disability charities and day centres, young peoples projects, sheltered housing facilities and mainstream schools.
Placements have also taken place in traditional hospital in-patient physical settings, focusing on promoting the use of meaningful activity to enhance health and wellbeing, for example via breakfast clubs and supporting internet shopping.
Where are the placements?
Placements take place across the south-east of England, including Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Medway, and South London.
It may be necessary for you to travel up to 90 mins or to stay away from home.
What placement support can I expect?
We provide preparation sessions in advance and a practice educator will support you on placement.
We will allocate all your placements (except the final one), with the view that you will need to experience a variety of practice settings.
Whilst we will take into consideration issues such as travelling time, and carer commitments, a placement close to home cannot be guaranteed and you will need to be aware of this and be flexible in relation to placement provision/allocation.
You will arrange your own final placement in consultation with your personal tutor to ensure the placement will meet your needs.
Halfway through the placement, a tutor will meet with you and your practice educator online to discuss your progress.
What if I fail a placement?
The majority of students pass their placements.
Should you fail, we treat this as a development opportunity and we will provide a second opportunity for you to undergo the placement in a similar, but different, setting.
Should you fail the second attempt you can no longer proceed and will normally be required to leave the course.
This is unusual but is possible – in this event we would endeavour to support you through this process and you may be able to leave with an academic award at a lower level than a degree depending on the modules completed.

Rachael Dinnage
“I felt that occupational therapy would allow me to apply my interest in the arts in many practical ways and there are also a wide variety of job opportunities available within the profession.
“Occupational therapy is a healthcare profession which involves adapting environments, tasks and routines to ensure people can continue to engage in what is meaningful to them when experiencing physical or mental illness.
Occupation does not refer to work in the context of the course, occupation is everything we need and want to do and is personal to everyone.
“On the MSc course everyone has come from very different education and work backgrounds which gives you even more opportunities to learn from your peers as well as the tutors on the course.
“The support from our course team has been fantastic.
The team have created a really positive online learning environment and I’ve felt more confident engaging in discussions and asking questions than I expected to be.
“I’ve completed two placements so far.
The first was between a Stroke ward and a Care of the Elderly ward – this gave me an insight of working in a fast-paced hospital setting, focusing on physical health needs and equipment.
My second placement was with the Care Home in Reach Team in Brighton.
The team works with care homes as clients, facilitating workshops for staff on best practice in supporting people living with dementia.
The experience gave me a valuable insight into working as part of a community mental health team and helped build my confidence.
“I get the impression that Brighton values the diversity of experience different students have which makes for a really interesting learning environment.
I also feel it has very good links with professionals and build this into the courses which gives you an insight into employment after studying.”
Luci Carnall-Moore
“I completed my Occupational Therapy (pre-registration) training at Brighton University and I could not have comprehended at the time how much this would change and enrich my life.
I was engaged and motivated in the learning process through varied and stimulating placements, dynamic problem-based learning sessions and inspiring fixed resource sessions with people coming in to share their lived experiences.
“Upon graduating I immediately gained employment as the only OT in a Community Mental Health Team.
The learning curve was steep, but I felt equipped and confident in consolidating my role due to the skills that I had developed on the course.
These skills then took me beyond my traditional NHS OT role as I was able to apply and transfer them to community development.
I was successful in securing funding to set up a community hub which aims to promote social inclusion and cohesion.
The funding proposal was based on OT evidence and research and the recognition of my skills, knowledge and experience.
“Four years on and the project continues to grow with the development of a regular Intergenerational Supper Club, the planting of a community orchard and sustaining strong links with other community projects.
I am also a Placement Educator in this diverse setting, I deliver fixed resource sessions at the university and facilitate problem-based learning sessions.
I could not recommend this course at Brighton University more to begin an exciting journey into Occupational Therapy and beyond!”
Ariana Smith Rodríguez
“After a wonderful two years at the University of Brighton completing the MSc, I have recently begun my new job as an occupational therapist at the first public community therapeutic garden in Spain.
I am currently developing and carrying out an occupational therapy service for older adults at Jardines Terapéuticos Palmlölf in Madrid.
My work focuses on assessing and enabling the participation of service users in meaningful activities or occupations within the garden environment.
“The interventions mainly involve horticulture and nature-related activities as a means of therapy, cognitive stimulation therapy, reminiscence therapy and sensory stimulation using plants and elements from within the garden.
The training I received at Brighton, through modules such as horticulture skills and diverse placement, was essential in providing me with the tools to successfully create and adapt gardening activities for service users, as well as independently develop and manage an occupational therapy service.”
Jamie Liddell
“I loved training to be an occupational therapist at the University of Brighton!
The MSc course strikes the perfect balance between practical and academic learning, and really promotes effective team-working.
“The problem-based learning approach really suited my learning style and the placements were invaluable in preparing me for clinical practice.
I have since had the opportunity to take on students of my own and am even back studying part-time at Brighton to complete a clinical research masters degree.
“The tutors have been so supportive right through my occupational therapy journey.
I would thoroughly recommend studying here!”
Alice McGarvie
“I really enjoyed the Occupational Therapy (pre-registration) MSc course at the University of Brighton.
The mixture of problem-based learning, lectures, interactive sessions, patient expert sessions and placements gave me a really broad understanding of the variety of applications for occupational therapy.
“I particularity enjoyed the Diverse Settings module, which enabled me to learn about the range of diverse roles in occupational therapy and experience a placement in a setting that did not have an occupational therapist.
This enabled me to think about the occupational therapy process and how to apply it in a new setting.
This experience and my learning from it has helped me to set up my occupational therapy and harp service From the Harp.”
Rosemary Leaver
“I’d heard great things about the course at Brighton from people who had already completed it and I was really impressed with the tutors and facilities when I came for an interview.
On the course I really valued the opportunity to carry out an original research project, and the opportunity to do five placements was also extremely valuable for gaining experience in very different areas, from paediatric charity work to forensic mental health.
“After qualifying as an occupational therapist, I spent two months developing an occupational therapy service for a small charity in rural India.
I worked in a residential school for children and young people with a range of physical and learning disabilities, many of whom had never had access to occupational therapy before.
I was able to use skills I’d learnt on my occupational therapy degree, especially during a paediatric placement for a charity in London to run groups and one-to-one sessions at the school in India.
The charity staff were very pleased with the work I did, and I’m now working with the charity to encourage more occupational therapists to volunteer.
This included going back to the University of Brighton to give a lecture on cross-cultural practice, which prompted two graduates to decide to volunteer at the same charity.
“The tutors on the course are all very knowledgeable and experienced, and having regular contact with a named personal tutor made me feel very supported throughout the course.
This course allowed me to become a qualified occupational therapist with the opportunity to work across a huge range of health and social care settings in the world.
If you’re interested in a career in occupational therapy, this course will give you the skills, experience and confidence to make it happen.”

As one student, who could not imagine a course without these sessions, asked: “How can we learn about doing without doing?”
These classes are central to the philosophy of our occupational therapy education at Brighton and they have become one of its hallmarks.
Occupational therapists work with individuals and their families to identify where change is needed.
The individual might not be able to feed or dress themselves independently if they can only use one hand following a stroke, or they may be too depressed to get out of bed to go to work.
Occupational therapists try to discover what the impediments are and how the person might be able to resolve them practically.
This often involves demonstrating new techniques that allow the individual to undertake everyday activities independently again.
Alternatively, occupational therapists might introduce new activities, such as cooking or pottery, so the individual may find enjoyment or improve their self-confidence.
Occupational therapists believe that humans are creative beings who thrive when engaged in a balanced range of enjoyable activities.
Activity analysis finds that although the things people do may seem deceptively simple, human occupations are actually incredibly complicated.

You will practice in many different settings including the NHS, social care organisations, schools, the voluntary sector, hospital in-patient settings, community settings and mental health services.
Placements take place across the south-east of England, including Kent, Sussex, Surrey and South London.
It may be necessary for you to travel up to 90 minutes or to stay away from home.
What support can students expect?
We select your placements for you after gathering information from you about your commitments outside of university, your previous experiences and your interests.
If you have commitments outside of university, such as caring responsibilities, we ask you to make contingency plans as you may have to travel up to one and a half hours to your placement.
A tutor will visit or call you and your practice educator halfway through the placement to discuss your progress.
Heidi Maxwell , course leader
“As a registered occupational therapist, I am passionate about how occupations affect health and wellbeing.
I am specifically interested in the transformational potential of occupations, including crafts, and in understanding what makes them ‘therapeutic’.
“My PhD focused on engaging in embroidering as an everyday occupation, and through my studies I discovered the variety of different activities involved in embroidering and how people engage in these to meet their health needs.
In essence, we self-medicate using occupation.
I also found that the tools and materials used in occupations are active participants in occupation, and engagement with them has a profound effect on the experience and potential therapeutic outcome.
“I find researching human engagement in occupation fascinating and I aim to ignite students’ curiosity in everyday occupation to promote health.
“As an educator, I have a long and sustained history in teaching occupational therapy at undergraduate, postgraduate and more recently PhD level.
I feel very privileged to support students in their personal and professional development at the point of joining the profession and throughout their career.
“Another passion is our problem-based approach to learning where students work together on solving current and real-life professional practice issues.
Through this philosophical foundation we support students to become robust, critical, collaborative and creative professionals ready for the future.”
After professional registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), you will be eligible to take up opportunities in health and social care, the NHS, social services and the private and voluntary sectors.

“I often saw university as being inaccessible due to many personal factors.
I had not considered occupational therapy as a career but the more I looked into the profession, the more I knew this was the direction I wanted to head.
“The course at Brighton includes the problem-based leaning approach to teaching which combined practical hands-on sessions and placement learning.
Not being a naturally academic student, this course allowed me a flexible approach to leaning, which suited me far better than traditional studies.
I had to be creative and self-directed to develop my knowledge and clinical reasoning skills, which I still use with my clients in a community mental health setting.
“Learning on the job with placement educators and group work opportunities gave me practical experience of the occupational therapist role and the benefit of working in multidisciplinary teams, all of which enhances wellbeing for my clients today.
“Discovering I had a learning disability halfway through the course came as both a shock and relief.
Staff were supportive in offering time and additional support when needed, and the university has a network offering support and guidance for both personal and professional issues.
The part-time course allowed me to retain a balanced life as a mum and grandma, continue with my self-employment and complete my academic studies.
“Over the four years, I have grown in ability and confidence and feel equipped and proud to be a member of the occupational therapy profession, where I encourage and support clients to build their own recovery journeys.”
Iain Wilkes
“My cohort was mixed with students from all sorts of backgrounds.
This benefited our learning and we all learnt a lot from each other as well as from our formal studies.
The academic staff were excellent, had a variety of clinical backgrounds and each brought their own unique flavour to learning.
I found them all to be very approachable and have maintained links with the university since graduation.
“Problem-based learning was new to me and is a great way to build confidence and skills in presenting and group participation, and it develops self-reliance.
There were also guest lectures from practising occupational therapists and a variety of fixed resource sessions.
The clinical placements were always a highlight; they were a necessary part of the training and also widened my perceptions and have benefited me in my current practice.
“I now work as specialist neurological occupational therapist in a community neurological rehabilitation team.
The course fostered a confidence and independence in my approach to learning and I have found it invaluable post-qualification.
I have been fortunate to be invited back several times to participate in or facilitate some learning sessions with current pre-registration students and always extol the benefits of studying occupational therapy at Brighton.”
Kate Guy
“For someone taking their first degree later in life than most, Occupational Therapy at the University of Brighton really was the perfect degree to maximise my skills as a student and my skills in life!”

Adam Davis
“I am currently the joint inter-professional lead for the paramedic programme, which entails me working with non-traditional placement providers to provide clinical experience for students outside an ambulance environment.
I joined the ambulance service in London and worked there for 16 years.
“I undertook a variety of roles, mostly around liaising and working with allied agencies such as the police and the fire service.
This experience has enabled me to bring the joint working to Brighton and to share this with the students, providing them with experience days alongside these agencies.”
Chris Storey
“As an ex-student of the paramedic course at the University of Brighton I was flattered to be offered a role as a senior lecturer on the course team in 2015.
Since then I have retained contact with the ambulance service through voluntary work and most recently by taking on the role of ambulance placements lead.
Additionally, in 2023 I took on the role of admissions tutor and have a key part to play in the selection of new students for the course each year.

Mia Collins
“It felt so right for me to study to become a paramedic as the requirement to be a people person, to be passionate and excited to make a difference was absolutely my cup of tea.
“At uni, we have clinical days where we practice practical skills using equipment such as manikins, life packs, fake arms and cannulation needles.
“We are on the ambulance twice a week, so we get to experience our future job right now!
It also means that we can practice things we learn in both theory and clinical uni sessions which is really good for reinforcing our learning.
“My first day on placement I’ll be honest I was really nervous!
However, once I was on base and had met my mentor, I felt a lot calmer.
The paramedics on the road are genuinely so kind and have all been in your position so know how you feel!
“I learnt very quickly not to be afraid to ask questions.
Most paramedics are happy to explain things as they do them and it’s much easier to learn as you go, asking what the equipment is and what someone is doing at the time rather than later on when it’s not in front of you.
“My fellow students on the course are amazing.
We support each other after difficult shifts, have great nights out and study together too.
We have created a really supportive, friendly environment.”
Nick Worman
“I wanted to study a degree that would provide me with a rewarding career and paramedic science came to mind as it would be hugely fulfilling to help others.
“All of our lecturers used to be paramedics which adds to the teaching experience.
You know you can ask them anything and they can give you specific examples to help with any questions.
“In the first few weeks we covered basic CPR, took ops, spent a week at SECAmb education centre and I had booked my first two ambulance shifts!
I really like that we had practical learning to look forward to from the very beginning.
“Theatre was my favourite placement as you join the anaesthetists when looking after patient airways.
I also got to enjoy observing various surgeries including femur fractures and surgery performed by robots!
“We have our own mentor each year who we work with on shift.
They help us develop our essential skills whilst also learning on the job.
Ambulance placement is two shifts a week and during my first year I worked on a mental health ward for a week.
Placements change to different specialist wards each study year.”
Jason Roberts
“I chose Brighton because of the placement structure.
The university has been able to bridge the gap between theory and practice through encouraging continuous placements throughout the degree.
“Having this approach creates a good balance of practical and theoretical teaching as well as giving continuous exposure to the pre-hospital clinical environment.
I was able to put skills learnt at university into practice out on the road, as well as having gradual exposure to real-life emergencies.
“I really enjoyed my theatres and anaesthetics placement.
It allowed me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice and hone my stepwise airway management techniques with the supervision and guidance of a consultant anaesthetist.
“The pre-hospital paramedic placement is invaluable for gaining first-hand experience of the workings of the ambulance service and the wider NHS.
The interprofessional placements allow a student to become a well-rounded clinician at the point of becoming a newly qualified paramedic.
“Brighton has a passion for teaching and wanting the best for students; staff include experienced nurses and paramedics as well as critical care clinicians.
Brighton has a range of simulation suites with iSimulate and lifecast technology which create a realistic experience.
“Having my degree has set me up with a good foundation to paramedicine.
The knowledge, experience and exposure I acquired will put me in good stead to practice as a newly qualified paramedic, as well as developing my career to eventually become a consultant paramedic.”
Jason’s tip : “Before you apply, get an understanding of what being a paramedic involves.
Being aware of the high-paced environment with range of shift patterns and current demands working frontline for the NHS in the ambulance service is essential.”
Chloe Lashmar
“From a very young age, I knew that I always wanted to help people.
I looked at many different universities and made the decision that Brighton would be the best university for me and my growth.
“The course offers the fundamental areas of knowledge that I needed in order to become a paramedic.
I love it.
Everyone is very friendly and approachable.
“I have enjoyed the practical elements of the course which began from the start of my first year.
The most important skill within the NHS is teamwork; the teaching staff enabled this to occur through practical sessions by allowing us to work together during scenarios.
“All the teaching staff are consistent and want you to succeed to become a paramedic – they bring expert knowledge and experiences.
The staff are very helpful to contact through email.
If I had any concerns or questions, the staff replied promptly.
“My ambulance placement was outstanding.
It is real life and there are hurdles that we must overcome each day, and only by overcoming these, learn for next time.
We get to meet and communicate with real patients who can tell us what their concerns are.
I felt like I was a well-respected colleague in a team.
I was told to be a sponge and just absorb every call we attended.
“My paramedic mentors have been incredible and I know that without their support, encouragement and the constructive criticism they have given me, I would not be in the position I am today.
The university also arrange non-ambulance placements, otherwise known as interprofessional placements.
These include: A&E, theatres for airway management and cannulation skills, paediatrics, cardiology, maternity and also a GP placement.”
Chloe’s tip: “Do it!!!
It does not matter what age you are or how little experience in the healthcare setting you may have.”
Autumn White-Moore
“I had wanted to start a career that was on the go and constantly changing, with new challenges, so paramedicine was a great fit.
I chose Brighton because of recommendations from family friends and the structure of continuous placement and university lectures throughout the year really appealed to me.
“The University of Brighton is a great place to study.
It has many study facilities and practical rooms as well as a great support network for any academic or personal struggles.
The rooms provided are spacious, with a range of equipment, and the simulation rooms are fantastic when working alongside the midwife students when doing collaborative work.
During the hotter months we are able to work outside, adding environmental factors to our simulations.
“The staff and students at Brighton are very welcoming, relaxed and supportive.
I received great academic support and guidance for my future career directions from the head of course.
“Placements provided an area to practice the skills talked about during lectures and help solidify knowledge developed in lectures.
Also, placements have allowed the application of my knowledge and skills onto real-life situations and scenarios.
“My mentors and colleagues in the ambulance service have been very supportive – they have been very beneficial in developing my understanding of the wider NHS and furthering my clinical skills.
“This degree has given me a direct line into a paramedic career and provided me with the resources to grow and develop into other careers, with employers recognising its high value.
“I would highly recommend this course to anyone considering becoming a paramedic.
It’s a fantastic way to start your career, providing both practical and academic skills for your future.
“The university has many societies to join and I would highly recommend finding one or two; the networking and friends that you can develop are very beneficial, allowing a relaxed space to unwind from studying.”
Autumn ’ s tip: “ The university has many societies to join and I would highly recommend finding one or two; the networking and friends that you can develop are very beneficial, allowing a relaxed space to unwind from studying.”
Charli Dean-Grainger
“The paramedic course at Brighton is slightly different to some in the way that it runs ambulance placements.
Many unis I considered ran block placements where you spend a couple of months on the road and then return to uni for a couple of months.
However, I was drawn to Brighton because it runs weekly placements all the way through the year, with us in university learning the theory and clinical skills one or two days a week and then doing 24-hours worth of ambulance shifts each week.
I prefer this method as I can learn a skill and have it fresh in my mind to practice it on the road that week.
“The course also offers a range of non-ambulance placements such as a week in the emergency department working alongside doctors and nurses, paediatric wards, maternity and operating theatres to help develop your knowledge by learning from specialists in each field.
“Brighton is a beautiful city with loads to do – I mean, who wouldn’t want the beach right on your doorstep, especially in summer!
There are also loads of amazing cafes and restaurants, especially if you’re vegetarian or vegan – you’ll have no trouble finding something you like.
“I feel like I’ve changed a lot since being at university; I feel more confident in myself and have really grown into my own skin a lot in the past year-and-a-half and I really think that is influenced by the freedom of self-expression in Brighton.”

Emma Chapman
“I have always been passionate about sport and physical activity as well as enjoying working with children and young people, so this was the perfect course as it is tailored specifically to teaching young people to learn new sports with the potential to inspire them to take part in physical activity for the rest of their life.
“I feel that my course has prepared me to become a good teacher.
I have learnt the most on teaching placement as this is great opportunity to get involved and learn on the job.
The course includes two 15-week placements at a secondary school teaching PE.
We are assessed mainly through practical assessments including teaching lessons and performing physical activity as well as a few essays.
“We get various opportunities to teach a range of lessons and we are provided feedback on each lesson to help us improve.
I have developed communication skills by being required to communicate effectively and appropriately during lessons.
I have learnt great leadership skills when required to lead a lesson.
“I feel supported by all lecturers, they are all approachable and most have experienced the pathways of university and teaching as we currently are, so we can relate to them personally and academically.”
Riley Chalfen
“I had my heart set on coming to Brighton as soon as I started looking!
One of the big influences was how highly my PE teacher recommended it – he studied himself at Brighton and has been a big inspiration for me.
“When I first looked at my timetable and saw the wide range of sports and activities I would be doing during my lectures, I knew that this was the right choice for me.
I have had so many opportunities to step out of my comfort zone and try things I have never done before such as mountain biking, raft building, dance and many more.
“My favourite thing about studying PE with QTS is how practical the majority of the lectures are.
I would say in the first year around 70–80% of your lectures are in a practical environment, whether that’s on the Astro, in the sports hall, dance studio, gymnastics gym, swimming pool or athletics track.
I have never been a huge fan of academic assessments and my course is tailored to that perfectly because all of my practical lectures get assessed through practical performance.
“PE with QTS fully prepares you for a career in teaching.
During each academic year you will spend time in a school on placement learning through experience and eventually teaching yourself.
Each lecture always gets linked back to a school environment; for example, in a rugby lecture you may pick up pointers from the way the lecturer is running the lesson that you can then use when you teach yourself.
“I am very excited for what the future holds.
I can't wait to get into schools and start teaching.”
Hannah King
“The transition from college to university was really smooth as the university provided so much information to me.
Don’t panic as everyone will be in the same position as you.
“I settled in fine, helped by joining societies and getting to know the other students.
“The University of Brighton is very inclusive and allows students to learn and succeed in their own individual way.
“I have met so many successful people in the field of physical education, such as the lecturers, and learning from them has been the highlight of my course so far.”
Kelly Jarvis
“My teachers at school always told me that if I wanted to go on and be a PE teacher I should go to the University of Brighton.
From the very first minute of visiting, I knew I wanted to go here.
“The course offers a diverse range of module options and opportunities outside of learning time – I went on a ski trip in year one and experienced OAA adventures and camping.
I was also given the opportunity to coach and teach gymnastics, dance and trampolining outside of university time in local secondary schools and have gained lots of coaching qualifications such as rugby level 1 and trampolining levels 1 and 2.
All of this helped when applying for jobs and coaching roles while studying as well as for when I graduate.
“The tutors were so supportive throughout my whole four years, whether for theoretical, practical or teaching knowledge.
There was always someone to talk to if I had any concerns or worries.
I was not just a number at a university studying a degree – I was an individual, someone they cared about and wanted to succeed.
“Gaining excellent subject knowledge and high-quality training in all areas of PE will allow me to be the best and most successful teacher I can be.
Following graduation I am going to teach physical education and dance in a mixed state school back at home in Kent.
I got the job before I had even graduated!
“This is the best thing I have ever done.
Not only have I developed into a well-organised, skilful and ambitious teacher, I have grown as an individual.
I have had the time of my life and if I could, I would do it all again.”
Liam Turner
“Being able to say that you are a University of Brighton QTS graduate is worth its weight in gold.
Schools see Brighton graduates as the cream of the crop and you have an upper hand even before they read the rest of your application.
“I have loved every single minute of my time at Brighton – from the friends I made to the facilities, to the extra-curricular opportunities, to the lecturers whose support was above and beyond anything I expected it to be.
“The two long, block placements were a real selling point – they allowed me to get stuck into and make a difference in both of my placement schools.
You teach on a 50% timetable and are observed every lesson by the normal class teacher, who will then provide you with feedback.
Both schools had different challenges and set me up perfectly for when I start full-time employment at a mixed secondary academy after graduation.
“If being a PE teacher is what you want to do as a career, then 100% this is the course for you.”

Physiotherapists help improve a person’s quality of life through advice, exercise and education.
Physiotherapy is a science-based profession and takes a ‘whole person’ approach to health and wellbeing, which includes the individual’s general lifestyle.
At the core is the person’s involvement in their own care.
The focus on interdisciplinary learning across all our health courses enriches apprentices’ experience while also preparing them for the reality of professional practice.
This course gives apprentices everything they need to work as a physiotherapist in the UK, with professional and portfolio development from start to finish.

The aim of the Physiotherapist Degree Apprenticeship programme is to embed apprentice-centred learning and teaching approaches that develop sustainability and encourage critical thinking across the whole programme.
The programme promotes reflective practice and peer-assisted learning approaches to facilitate apprentices’ active engagement in the learning process.
Reflection, self-development, self-direction, critical thinking, clinical reasoning and problem-solving are encouraged to enable apprentices to evaluate their own practice and that of others.
These skills are essential for achieving high-quality person-centred care.
Apprentices will have the opportunity to develop a broad appreciation of the environmental, social, political, legal and economic dimensions of physiotherapy practice within the health and social care context.
The learning and teaching approaches aim to support the overall objectives of the course and the learning outcomes of modules.
A variety of learning and teaching methods are used throughout the modules.
They are designed to encourage active participation by the apprentices.
The teaching methods include:
A range of assessment strategies and choices are employed to help apprentices with different learning styles to succeed.
Individual assessment strategies across the levels include:
Applicants should demonstrate recent* study at level 3 or above, for example:
A-levels: A recent high grade (A/B) in a biological science or Physical Education.
Open University: A grade 2 pass in Human Biology (SK277).
Other qualifications: Successful completion of Associate Practitioner Course, Health and Social Care Foundation Degree or other relevant level 3 courses.

We believe that an individual's positive engagement in learning activity leads to advanced productivity, increased perception of self-worth, improved quality of life and enjoyment of the course.
Our courses use problem-based learning (PBL), a technique recommended by authorities around the world.
All subjects covered are integrated around problem-solving within a real life situation.
We find that learning in this way significantly increases our students’ engagement with the subjects.
Advantages of the problem-based learning approach are:
Students report that they feel more motivated to learn theoretical knowledge as they can see where they can apply it to real-world situations
Teamwork and improved communication skills are developed, as students share their expertise and rationale behind their potential solutions
Students find they are more confidently able to search for information from a wider range of sources, such as journals, textbooks and the internet, and take more responsibility for learning independently
It encourages deeper learning, as it focuses on activities and activating knowledge in practice contexts, rather than traditional rote memory recall in a predominantly classroom-based context.

RuthAnn Fanstone
The University of Brighton was my first choice for a physiotherapy school.
I also liked the idea of being near a sports’ college as I was very keen on sport, which was also part of the reason for choosing physiotherapy as a profession.
I have very strong and positive memories of each of my lecturers at the university, they all inspired me.
The clinical placements were very strong and I definitely arrived well prepared (although I didn’t realise at the time how well I had been prepared) for my junior position at the busy Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham.
I remember working very hard at the university, but it was worth it and becomes a legacy throughout your career.
We really enjoyed having quite a lot of mature students in our group and we learnt a lot from them too.
I left the University of Brighton with a passion for neurological physiotherapy due to a particularly effective placement I had in neuro.
However, after two-and-a-half years as a junior I went to India for two years to set up a physiotherapy department in a rural 100-bed hospital and it was there that I came across a lot of burn injuries.
I had not done any burns or plastic surgery but due to the need I saw there I wanted to learn, so I came back to London and got the chance to set up a new burns and plastic surgery service at the Royal Free Hospital in London.
This was a great job and I got the chance to treat a number of large trauma cases.
I then moved on to bigger burn units Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London and Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead where I was lead physiotherapist.
I did my Health Services Management MSc at London University and in between I kept travelling to do burns work and teaching in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Africa.
I used my clinical and management experience to run a charity called Interburns (International Network of Training, Education and Research in Burns) from April 2010 to this year (2012) and weirdly in there somewhere I have also worked for a peace and reconciliation foundation in the Middle East.
Now I am working for The Katie Piper Foundation as a scar specialist/physiotherapist, exploring and gathering an evidence base for emerging treatments, learning from some European centres that have different approaches and looking into other areas of burn rehabilitation.
Physiotherapy opens so many doors and doing things outside physio can also really add to our skills and experience.
I found working internationally also very valuable.
A great school at the University of Brighton, and a strong junior rotation period, were a tremendous help to me and were an ideal foundation from which to move forward.
Burns and plastics has been a surprising but wonderful speciality.
I hope some more Brighton students will consider it going forward!
Based on my experience I would strongly recommend the University of Brighton ...
and physiotherapy as a career!

“The support from the university staff and fellow students is superb!

“One of the many benefits of this course was the way it was structured.
It has allowed me to combine my full-time job as a Teaching Assistant and my family commitments, including having two teenage children, with studying for my BA(Hons).
“As a mature student, that hadn’t touched a textbook for over 20 years, I was rather daunted by the prospect of returning to studying.
However, all of the programme staff have been so encouraging, supportive and understanding throughout the whole course.

Equally, it has enabled me to reflect upon my own experiences as a practitioner, and then build upon these further.
“Just by thinking about applying for this course you are also someone who passionately also believes that every child should receive a good quality education, one that challenges and inspires them.
This course will help you achieve this.

“I have loved making new friends and meeting so many people, and I know that we’ll be in touch long after we graduate.
I really enjoy the seminars and find them so interesting.
Applying what I have learnt to my work has been incredibly useful and I’ve grown in confidence both as a student and as a practitioner.

Going back to studying after a break of over 20 years was extremely daunting, but the tutors have been so friendly and encouraging.
From the very first session, I felt supported.
There is always help on hand if you need it.

Our graduates are currently working in Local Authorities, Public Health England, Health Education England, national and international universities and in a range of national and international public and non-governmental organisations.
We work closely with leading figures in Public Health to develop employment support and employability workshops.
These workshops have been finetuned following student feedback to ensure they are relevant and impactful.
The skills gained through these workshops and work opportunities that arise fit both local and overseas students, leading the way to new connections and targeted individual support to secure good jobs.
Up-to-date public health skills are at the core of our planning, and some of our core modules are unique in the tailored way they support the acquisition of these skills.
For example, our first core module teaches sought after Public Health skills, which are then assessed in a multi-modal portfolio of work.
In September 2023 we opened our new Evaluation Clinic - VALU.
This is a unique extracurricular activity where students get the opportunity to work alongside professionals from academia, NHS, local government and a national charities to evaluate an existing Public Health intervention.
Students learn about the theory and concepts of evaluation, work in small groups to evaluate sections of the work on their own (supported by professionals), and gain a variety of valuable employability skills in the field.
At the end of the course, students are awarded a certificate of completion which can be added to their CV in addition to the MSc in Public Health.
Our MSc in Public Health is part of The Public Health Specialty Training Programme in Kent, Surrey & Sussex .
Every year we host Public Health Specialty registrars who complete this course within Phase I of their training.

Our students include primary care and public health practitioners, specialist community public health nurses, health promotion specialists, community development workers, environmental health officers and managers in the NHS and local authorities.
Together, our course team and students form a dynamic MSc with interactive lectures, interdisciplinary group work and real-world dissertation projects.
We believe that our student cohort is greater than the sum of individual students, which is why we invest in building a strong community at the start of the academic year.
Our induction day might surprise you.
Once enrolled, you will be invited to spend a few hours in a mix of social/professional activities that truly ignite the cohort's community building.
We take account of different learning styles and we do not push students to socialise, yet the opportunity is there and the feedback tells us that it is much needed.
We are grateful to work with valued partners in experiential learning and research.

Simon Villaeys
“As a student from France, I found the University of Brighton a very warm and welcoming place to study.
“I have always had a passion for art.
Having previously taught in a number of French schools and feeling inspired by other art teachers, I decided to pursue a career in teaching.
“During my time on the course I learnt a lot of new techniques through workshops and collaborating with other students which helped me build my subject expertise and develop new skills.
“School-based training provided an opportunity to put theory to practice, using techniques learnt in university sessions to enhance creativity in school lessons.
One of my particular highlights on placement was an opportunity to teach on a one-to-one basis with A-level students.
“Although challenging, I am so glad I have done this course!
Studying the (Secondary) Art and Design PGCE has taught me to push my boundaries and I couldn’t have done so without the support from my tutor, the rest of the cohort, my mentor and school-based teachers!
“As a newly qualified teacher, I am very much looking forward to finding a role in teaching and the next step in my career.”
Olivia Broadbent Smith
“I chose the University of Brighton as I knew they have an excellent (Secondary) Art and Design PGCE and a high standard of subject knowledge to help develop my own practice.
“A highlight of this course for me was the level of support from everyone, in particular from my cohort who were really encouraging.
Working so closely with peers allowed us to support one another and provided a really strong network to share experiences and ideas.
“The workshops we participated in, the visits to galleries and museums and school visits were invaluable to me.
All these elements of the course were helpful in developing my creative practice; they also gave me confidence in suggesting new techniques and approaches whilst in school-based training.
The resources developed during these sessions have since become a great source of reference for my NQT year.”

I was able to gain experience in aspects of teaching before going on placement, such as differentiation, working with mixed ability classes, effective outcomes and objectives for lessons as well as assessment for learning techniques.
As well as this, the lecturers taught me how to be a reflective practitioner and to always continue to learn and develop my practice after each lesson through evaluation and feedback.

While I acquired some crucial experience in the four years I was there, I wasn’t getting job fulfilment and wanted to work in a role where I was giving more back to society.
“When considering what career would give me that satisfaction, I landed on teaching as I wanted to help young people through education, like my teachers had helped me.
“After gaining work experience in a couple of schools, I knew teaching would be the right career for me.
The University of Brighton being rated outstanding for teacher training provision in my field was a large attraction to apply, and the impression the university gave when I went for my interview confirmed that I was making the right decision.
“The course team are absolutely incredible!
I can’t fault them for the amount and quality of support they provided during my study.
No problem is too much for them and there was always a solution to any difficulty I was having.
On top of the pastoral side of things, the course team really know their stuff in their specialist areas!
This really gives you massive confidence in what you are learning and then applying during practice later on.
“My placements were invaluable experiences.
I got to teach at two very different schools in terms of size and school culture.
This enabled me to learn from a variety of excellent teachers and helped me to incorporate great ideas into my teaching practice.
The different placements helped broaden my knowledge of common school policies too.
“I really enjoyed the built-in opportunities for group work and discussion among my peers, and made amazing relationships with my teaching colleagues and the students I taught.
“I secured my first ECT role after my second interview in the February before graduating (not without help from my tutors first!).
I have really enjoyed my first year as an ECT at this school and have accepted a new role at my first placement school for the second year of my ECT.
The school I’m re-joining is currently undergoing some real growth and there are lots of progression opportunities – something I wasn’t expecting so early in my teaching career.
“My advice to anyone thinking about studying a PGCE is to be prepared for the workload and the amount of time you’ll need to invest as a teacher, not just on your PGCE.
Teaching is an incredibly demanding career but having said that, you’ll also experience moments that are hugely rewarding and remind you why you chose to become a teacher.”
Marek Chodurek
“I chose to study Mathematics (Secondary) PGCE at the University of Brighton as I wanted to combine my knowledge and understanding of mathematics with working with young people.
I come from a family of teachers, so it felt a natural fit to become a maths teacher.
“The course leaders are incredibly supportive and motivational, with subject leaders offering fantastic support through intense and stressful periods.
Most of all, the effort you put in is completely appreciated by all.
“One of the advantages of this course are the placement opportunities available.
Quite early into the course, you are sent out to a school where you are able to gain valuable classroom experience.
“I loved every minute of both my placements which were based in different surroundings.
I feel that this is ultimately where the biggest learning curve has happened for me and it has helped me to prepare for the next year as an NQT.
“I highly recommend this course to anyone thinking about applying.
Brighton is a great place to live and study and the surrounding schools in partnership with the university are great environments to help support anyone wanting to become an aspiring teacher.”

Portfolio and project proposal
You can study on a part-time or full-time basis.
Lectures, seminars, reviews and assessments are held at fixed times on Wednesdays.
Other patterns of attendance vary according to individual circumstances.
During holidays you will be engaged in independent study.
Your work will be predominantly project based, which may comprise of one or more parts focusing on a central theme or idea.
A single project or investigation will in most cases sustain a student through the entire duration of the course, but at stage assessment, in consultation with tutors, it may naturally evolve into a new or related area of study.
The nature of the subject demands the continual interaction between research, analysis, and practical realisation, as well as an extended period of development for ideas to become fully meaningful.
Throughout this investigation you will receive support and guidance from the course tutors.
As the course develops, there is increasing opportunity for independent and self-directed work, though each student is allocated a personal tutor who oversees the planning and content of individual projects.
Besides practice-based work, the course also includes a written element in which you will be asked to reflect critically on the research and development of your project.
While students accepted on the course should come with the technical skills necessary to fulfil their projects, access to the diverse workshops facilities – for example in bookbinding, letterpress, printmaking and photography – will be made available as appropriate to your project.
There is also a substantial specialist library and a full range of computer facilities.
In this module you will develop your individual major project proposed at interview.
It integrates project work, critical work, lectures, seminars, presentations and tutorials to help you design and plan your project and provides opportunities for you to discuss key issues relating to your particular subject area.
Your project is a single body of work that is a coherent programme of study and consists of one task or several related tasks developed independently.
This module is framed by the broad question ‘What is research?’ and encourages you to explore how research can relate to and enrich your existing practice.
You’ll use research methods to develop your own research question and identify how it sits within contemporary discourse around your subject.
You will learn how practice informs this enquiry both academically and within professional contexts.
In this module you will further develop your major project either by continuing the project, exploring another aspect or means of production or agreeing a new project that builds on previous work/research.
You will develop strategies to articulate your project in ways that invite discussion, advice and assistance from peers and staff.
You’ll also gain critical independence to extend the knowledge base upon which your project is founded and identify its potential professional and academic applications beyond the course.
Culminating in a written project report, this module involves the further development of practical and theoretical research and is supported by lectures, seminars and tutorials.
Your report will be a critical overview of your major project in which you’ll analyse and reflect on the advances made and lessons learned in the previous research and project modules.
This will produce a record of influences and major changes of direction.
In this module, you will reflect on the entire project from initial stages to completion and provide a cohesive summary of the work, both practical and theoretical, undertaken during the course.

“As someone who was never sure which route they wanted to go down, I thought this course was perfect.
“When I began university I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to specialise in, so social science was a really good option as it gave me the opportunity to pick and choose different modules across the degrees in the School of Humanities and Social Science, tailoring the degree to my interests.
Throughout the years I began to realise which disciplines were my favourite and that I could focus more on those.
It made me feel more confident in my choices as I had tried and tested them all.
“There have been some really inspirational lectures and teaching sessions.
Towards the end of second year and in the third year, there were more intimate classes and positive encouraging lecturers that helped us to nurture our ideas and confidence.

Annie Mullin, course leader
“I am a Social Work England-registered social worker, Fellow of Advance HE, senior lecturer and the course leader of the Social Work BSc(Hons) and I have worked at the University of Brighton since 2017.
“At present I teach, module coordinate, assess and act as a personal academic tutor and dissertation supervisor, primarily on the BSc course.
This includes supporting students on their practice placements.
“My current teaching, tutoring and course leadership draws on my 20 years of experience working in voluntary sector social care and statutory social work.
Before joining the University of Brighton I supported adults and their carers in my social work roles, including people living with dementia, long-term disabilities and short-term health problems.
“Having worked in multidisciplinary teams and in hospital settings in my direct practice, I am enthusiastic about the opportunities for inter-professional education offered to our social work students at the University of Brighton.
My additional experience as a practice supervisor and educator for social work students on practice placements developed my interest in enabling student learning and led to my move into an academic social work role.
This experience underpins the active learning approaches I use in my teaching to support the deep learning students of social work need to prepare them for practice.”

Ruth
“I always wanted to work in a role that I would make a difference and support children and families.
I had my own social worker who massively supported me and had such a positive effect on me and my family.
“The lecturers/tutors were extremely supportive and engaging during our sessions and I enjoyed that the course did not focus on just adults’ or children’s services as this helped me choose the area I wanted to go into.
“The placements showed me how the knowledge I have learnt is used in practice.
Having this opportunity showed me the many paths of social work you can take and the variety of people you can support.
It was beneficial having one placement in adults’ and one placement in children’s services as I got to experience the different types of support offered.
“I now work in a children and families assessment and intervention team and I love this role.
There has been a leap in responsibility due to holding my own caseloads, but I feel extremely supported by my team and manager.”
Melanie
“My first placement was in the alcohol and drug service (CGL).
This 70-day placement opened my eyes to the life experiences of adults and the true meaning of the Care Act, Human Rights Act and the Mental Capacity Act.
“I adored being the advocate for adults and learnt the value of harm reduction, knowledge of mental health, homelessness, domestic violence and prison, alongside respect for the lives they had lived.
“My final year 100-day placement was with the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children team.
Children would arrive alone into the UK and often would have experienced abuse, bereavement, harm, war, trafficking, loss and self-harm and suffered deep trauma.
“This course has meant that I have been able to successfully get a job with a local authority and work within the child protection team which has always been my aim.”
Madison
“I chose to study social work because witnessing the impact of social services on my family and friends inspired me to support others in building healthier relationships and resilient lives.
I chose Brighton because of the beautiful local area, and it was in the top 10 rated for Social Work.
“In my first placement at a YMCA residential for 16–25-year-olds, I gained hands-on experience supporting young adults transitioning to independence, helping me understand the unique challenges they face.
“My second placement with children in care deepened my insight into the foster care system and the specific needs of vulnerable children.
“Both placements reinforced my commitment to advocating for youth and equipped me with practical tools to make a positive impact in social work.
“The course provides both practical experience and strong theoretical knowledge, preparing you for a career where every day is meaningful and impactful.
If you are passionate about helping others and ready to grow both personally and professionally, social work is a truly fulfilling path.
“Since I graduated in July 2024, I am now a newly qualified social worker with a children’s trust under its ASYE Programme.
I have been placed in a child in care court team which has been an incredible experience so far.”
Justina
“What I enjoy the most about the social work course is the teamwork and group work.
It is a good feeling to know that you are not on your own in decision-making as interagency and multidisciplinary collaboration is one of the professional requirements of social work.
“The course has also built my confidence.
An aspect of the course known as problem-based learning gave me an opportunity to work with students on other courses, like nursing and occupational therapy, to formulate dilemmas and ways of solving them which in the future will help in my collaborative work with other professionals and in multidisciplinary team meetings.
“My first placement was with a local charity that supports asylum-seeking children between 16–18 years.
It was such an interesting experience as it gave me a first-hand opportunity to support service users experiencing various forms of trauma.
“I learned so much about myself as an individual but also about the need to take a trauma-informed approach to practice, using research-based knowledge on theories, skills like good communication and active listening, values such as honesty and respect, as well as the appropriate use of self.
“When I graduate, I would like to go into adult social work.
I plan to work in the statutory sector as I believe this will be a good learning avenue during my ASYE year.
I am a social activist kind of social worker and would most likely go into supporting refugees and asylum seekers in the long term.”
Ellie
“I currently work as a support worker and have done this for the past four years.
Becoming a qualified social worker felt like the next logical career step for me to take.
“The thing I enjoy most about the course is the range of people I get to meet, work with and learn from – including tutors, fellow social work students and service users and professionals out on placements!
I’ve learnt so much already just from hearing about others’ experiences and perspectives.
“My first placement was at a supported accommodation hostel for women with complex needs alongside a need for housing.
All of them had experienced or were experiencing some type of homelessness alongside substance misuse, mental health problems, domestic violence and abuse, physical health problems, or a combination.
“A typical day would start with the morning meeting including a handover from the night before, and once that was over the office door would be open so the service users could interact with us staff whenever they needed.
“I key-worked three residents who all had very different needs, so my days would consist of helping them access other services, supporting them to attend appointments, helping them with daily living activities or doing intervention work with them, such as recovery stars and setting SMART targets.
“As someone who learns by ‘doing’, I feel as soon as I started placement, all I’d started to learn in class solidified and made so much more sense.
It also gave me a more realistic view of what social workers and social care staff are faced with on a daily basis.”
Sophie
“I chose to study social work because I have really enjoyed my previous work in welfare within the education sector, specifically with teenagers.
I have always found helping others fulfilling, and many of the core values and qualities of social work resonate with me.
“Brighton is an open-minded and diverse place and it’s fantastic to be studying social work while living here.
The supportive and personable nature of the teaching staff, which I sensed during my interview, really confirmed that this was the right place for me to study.
“The aspect I am enjoying most about the course is the interactive nature of it.
Most of our lectures and seminars are very practical, with lots of conversations as to how we would approach situations in practice.
It has been interesting hearing the other students’ perspectives and experiences.
“The teachers have been kind and approachable, and clearly put a lot of effort into planning and delivering their classes.
The learning environment is very open, kind and non-judgemental, which has made me feel comfortable speaking up in lectures and developing my teamwork skills.”
Tyler
“I was drawn to the University of Brighton because it combines that sense of inclusivity with a strong focus on social issues and community engagement – both of which are central to social work.
“Brighton offers a vibrant, diverse and welcoming community and it feels like a place where I can truly engage in my studies, whilst still feeling connected, surrounded by people who are equally passionate about making a difference.
“Our class size is quite a bit smaller than other courses, which I really like as it allows us to have discussions and ask questions to really unpack each concept.
This environment allows me to hear a range of different perspectives and helps me feel more confident in applying these ideas on placement and, eventually, in practice.
“What I gained from my placement that differed from the classroom was the real-world application of the theories, laws and approaches we discuss in lectures.
Experiencing the dynamics of client interactions and seeing how social workers advocate for their clients provided me with valuable context for my learning.
“The support from all the staff has been phenomenal.
Having people like individual tutors and the Student Support and Guidance Tutors to support me and signpost me to resources made the world of difference.
It was reassuring to know that I had people to talk to if I ever struggled with anything, university-related or otherwise.”
Tobie
“The amount you will learn and change within even just the first year is exciting!
Already by the second year I feel so much closer to understanding my own professional identity.
“The staff have been amazing – they always listen to our feedback and when things don’t run smoothly, either personally or within uni, they are easy to talk to and support us with solutions.
I find the lecturers so engaging and I like that we are a small group.
It isn’t the kind of course where you just get talked at by a lecturer – it feels collaborative and supportive.
“I have already made so many friends from different backgrounds within the course.
Meeting people from all sorts of work has given me an inside look at the kind of career paths I could have which I may not have considered before.
“I have so far completed my three-day shadowing placement which was with the Brighton & Hove Children and Families Pod.
I found the placement so helpful as I can start to see how the knowledge I have gained at uni is applied in practice, which pieces everything together.
“The Moulsecoomb campus is lovely, the library is one of my favourite spots to get work done.
I love being close to the sea and Brighton has a very diverse population.
I also know it has a lot of great charities which I am likely to come into contact with within my work and placements.”
Rosie
“I chose to do social work as I have always wanted a career in helping people and the Social Work BSc degree gives the knowledge, skills and qualification to be able to do so effectively.
I am also incredibly lucky to be surrounded by people already in the profession who inspired me to go for it!
“I chose to come to Brighton as I had visited the city before and really liked it; I also did a lot of research into the university and found that it really focuses on supporting students in terms of their studying and wellbeing which was really important for me.
“My interview at the University of Brighton was such a positive experience.
I was made to feel so relaxed and in control, which allowed me to perform to my best ability.
I felt really supported, listened to and valued, which further influenced my decision to come to Brighton.
“To anyone thinking of applying to the social work course, I would say 100% go for it, it is one of the best decisions I have ever made!
I have already learned so much and have grown as a person.
I have also met some amazing and inspiring people.
“For me, the teaching and support staff are the best part of the University of Brighton.

Year 1 introduces core skills, theories and approaches for social work practice and social work research, the underpinning knowledge that you go on to apply during your placement.
This knowledge base incorporates perspectives from across the social sciences, including psychology and sociology, enabling you to develop a holistic approach to practice – something supported by critical attention to social work values and ethics.
Year 2 builds on the learning already completed and is where you develop knowledge and skills for more specialist, complex and challenging practice.
Contemporary social work practice and preparation for employment are explored to help prepare you for work after graduation.
Research methods and methodologies are examined in depth as part of the dissertation for MSc students.
Within this year, you will gain a greater awareness of yourself as a practitioner and undertake increased levels of autonomous and challenging practice.
This module introduces knowledge of human development across the lifespan including a range of bio-psychosocial and related theories such as systems theory.
Different cultural contexts will be taken into account, including disability, mental health, harm and abuse, inequality, exclusion and discrimination.
You’ll learn to critically evaluate relevant theory and research in relation to bio-psychosocial development and social work practice.
During this module you will analyse and apply legal/policy contexts of social work practice to different scenarios, taking into consideration legal responsibilities and statutory powers.
Key topics include critical awareness human rights, equality, justice, discrimination and social inclusion issues; partnership working and ethical practice in accordance with social work values; anti-discriminatory and anti-oppressive practice; and service user/carer choice and empowerment.
This module enhances your learning and ability to critically engage with and evaluate situations involving competing demands, rights and values both in terms of social work practice and research.
You’ll develop key attributes such as critical thinking, research mindedness, systemic appraisal and decision-making as well as skills for appraising, analysing, assessing and managing situations involving risk and the need for protection.
This module involves an in-depth inquiry into a specific area of practice which allows you to develop the skills required to plan and execute an ethical small-scale qualitative research project.
It involves the integration of knowledge relating to practice as well as research methodologies and methods and will develop your ability to independently carry out and evaluate research to inform your practice.
This module focuses on your continuing professional development and acts as a bridge towards qualification.
You will review recent and emerging issues in social work practice and evaluate practice settings, including the challenges and opportunities faced by the sector and practitioners.
The module provides a contemporary and critical overview of the functions of governmental bodies and other agencies involved in social work.
It also encourages you to develop your ability to undertake critical and reflective self-assessment.
This module is a mixture of university-based learning – including skills days and group tutorials – and practice learning via a 70 to 80-day placement.
You will learn to apply relevant law, policy and social science and social work theory, methods, skills and research to practice by working directly with service users and carers.
You’ll also explore social work values and ethics, crucially those of anti-discriminatory practice, social justice and inclusion.
This module expands your learning and forms the second half of the placement requirement.
Learning takes place within the university and in a 100-day statutory placement setting or an organisation that undertakes delegated statutory work.
It will enable you to gain the skills required to intervene in complex and challenging situations, including those involving intersecting needs and risks.
You’ll also develop critical analysis and reflection skills, in relation to your own practice and that of others.
Lucy Basterra, course leader
Lucy is a registered social worker and qualified Practice Educator with over 10 years’ practice experience in Brighton & Hove.
After qualifying, she went on to specialise in supporting those affected by domestic abuse and sexual violence, having a particular interest in understanding, and working with, trauma.
She has further experience working in substance misuse treatment settings where she designed and delivered the substance misuse training programme for Brighton & Hove City Council.
Before lecturing, she worked for the Fulfilling Lives Project, which was one of 11 programmes nationally that provided intensive and tailored support to people with multiple and complex needs, helping the most vulnerable and hard to reach.
Read Lucy’s full profile.
Katie:
What have you found enjoyable about the course so far?
“I have found it enjoyable meeting other people that are quite like-minded and I think, because of the emotive nature of the course and that everyone’s really busy, it’s nice to be able to relate to people that are going through something quite similar and shaping your experiences with everyone else as well.”
How have you found it being a social student working towards a vocational and academic qualification?
“There have been points where it feels very full-on and you’re definitely very busy between uni work and your placement, but it’s good, nothing feels too intense because there’s so much variety and you get to try different things.
“When your placement feels like it’s been quite full-on for a few days and you have a uni day, that kind of breaks it up a little bit.
It’s quite motivating as well to have a specific role that you want to work towards whilst you’re doing your uni work.”
Amy:
How has teaching supported your learning and are there any key bits of learning that stand out?
“There are certain things on the course that you think you don’t remember, but when you’re in a situation with a service user you think, oh, I remember that theory or that model, and it is comes to your mind, and actually you’ve soaked up more than you thought you did, because obviously it’s over the course of a certain period of time.
I found we’ve taken more from each lecture than we thought we had.”
What sorts of things are you thinking about now that you weren ’ t thinking about before?
“Because social work is such a values-based profession, when you apply, you already have those values; if anything, it just strengthens it.
The way I always think about social work is, you’re basically being paid to do what you would do for free a lot of the time because of the values that we all have.
“So I think that just grows and grows and grows and grows, and I feel privileged to be on the course and to be training to be a social worker.”
Our Social Work MSc (PGDip) is approved by Social Work England (SWE), the regulatory body for the social work profession and qualifying training programmes in England.

“I studied Sport and Exercise Science at Brighton between 2017 and 2020.
And then following on from that, I did a masters in Sports Physiology and graduated in 2021.
“I originally chose the University of Brighton because I just really liked the campus and the hands-on nature of the course.
I liked the fact that it was very lab-based and the facilities they had on-site were top-level.
“Being a student at Brighton was brilliant for me.
As it was quite a small cohort I felt connected to my lecturers and my fellow students and I felt it allowed me to be confident within any lab-based or practical-based group work.
“Now I am a performance coach for a private company called Go Perform.
In that role I do a mixture of things, a lot of group S&C coaching and physiological testing on a range of different athletes and individuals.
“What I love about my current job is the fact I get to work with so many different people with different sporting backgrounds.
I feel like I can help them achieve the goals that they want to achieve.
“What I learnt the most at Brighton was probably the lab-based skills that I could take away to my current career.
In my job I do a lot of physiological testing; VO2 max tests and lactate threshold tests, those are some skills that I learnt in the undergrad and in the MSc degree that I’ve carried on doing.
“But it was nice to get that first experience on the course and then slowly build on that as I’ve gone through my career.”
Harry McCulloch
“Since graduating from the University of Brighton I’ve completed two internships, worked in professional rugby and have now made a career at the top of Women’s football in England.
“Prior to gaining my BSc in Sport Science I had my eyes set on becoming a strength and conditioning coach but the prospect of attaining a job in elite sport seemed like a significant challenge.
I feel the education and support I received whilst studying at the University of Brighton was the perfect foundation to help put me on the path to achieving that goal.
“Integral to this was the state-of-the-art facilities, access to the high performance gym with motion capture and force plate technology, and most importantly the knowledge and enthusiasm of the staff.
No amount of studying can make up for the role of a good tutor.
“I can’t overstate the importance of having people like Rob Harley and Flo Pietzsch with a wealth of experience to draw from to help start my journey.”
Harry is pictured with members of Chelsea FC Women where he works as 1st Team Movement Coach.
Kemal Ismail
“I was on the Sport and Exercise Science programme and graduated in 2014.
It being a CASES-accredited course has helped me in a number of ways.
It gives a lot more value to the course and the modules that you do, which if you want to do anything in sport will only help you.
“I thought it was great that they brought in a few speakers from different professions that you can go into.
Somebody from Arsenal Football Club came in and spoke about the work that they were doing with the Academy players, and that's what kind of really ignited the thought of ‘yes, that’s what I want to do’.
“For almost ten years now, I’ve been fortunate enough to work in football across Academy men’s first team and women’s first team football, which have been unbelievable experiences.
“The roles I’ve had have ranged from Lead Academy Sport Scientist to Head of First Team Sports Science and Medicine to currently Head of Physical, and I will be progressing into a senior S&C role.
“My time at Brighton taught me a lot about myself, which helped me from a personal perspective to grow, and professionally it’s definitely opened up doors which otherwise would not have been opened.
It helped shape the person and the practitioner that I am today.”
Sarah Murray
“I’m an HSPC registered sports psychologist running my own company called Performance Edge working with clients such as the Premier League, the FAI and various high-performance sports spaces.
“I chose the University of Brighton because I knew that its reputation for Sports Science was one of the best.
“Although I knew I wanted to pursue a teaching route, I didn’t want to tie myself to any one particular career.
Sports Science would give me a flavour across physiology, psychology, social elements, the history of sport, as well as biomechanics.
“I think the power and strength of the degree is that it can take you anywhere.
It just sets you up with so many different skills that you can use in any way possible.
“What I do now is I work as a sports psychologist with elite athletes and elite performance coaches.
One area that I work on is cultural architecture, so thinking about high-performance healthy cultures and how we balance high performance with mental wellbeing.
“I also work with individuals on how they want to progress within their career, supporting them to perform when they’re out on a pitch, a track or a court, but not at the expense of their mental and physical health.”
Adam Chilcott
“I chose Sport and Exercise Science because I’ve always been interested in sport.
Unfortunately, being an actual sports person was never really on the cards and I’ve always had an interest in science and maths.
“I now work at Brighton & Hove Albion as the Under 15s and Under 16s performance analyst.
I work in capturing the footage of games as well as collecting data on the players to help improve performance.
“I gained a lot of different traits from my studies that have helped me become the analyst I am today.
I got a really good technical proficiency using various software, which are the ones I now use within my career line as an analyst.
“During my studies I had an opportunity film with the Lawn Tennis Association.
They approached the university looking for some help for the Wimbledon qualifier tournament and the Roehampton Junior tournament.
It gave me the opportunity to go and spend time working in an applied setting using the software we had at the university already.”
Ben Sayers
“I chose Brighton as I was impressed by the facilities on our tour – they were well kitted out and I knew I would get more time in them with a smaller cohort.
The heat chamber and the hypoxic chamber were very cool, and we did some great studies as a class in them.
“Uni is fantastic for supplying the knowledge and theoretical know how, but the placement teaches you how to use it and communicate, so they both go hand in hand.
The placement was huge for me.
“If you love human performance in any way, shape or form, then I would for sure recommended you undertake a sport science degree.
You will discover things you didn’t know you didn’t know, then your love for the industry will snowball with new insights and takes on the various topics.
“The location, the lectures and lecturers, and facilities are world-class.
I would seriously recommend this university for anyone who is looking for a complete package.”
Ben continued his studies at Brighton with our MSc in Strength and Conditioning.
Since graduating he has worked for Wycombe Wanderers FC as physical performance and preparation coach.
Amy Davies
“The flexibility of my degree is what first attracted me to it.
There are choice modules in which you can pick which topics interest you the most and therefore could lead to a possible career pathway.
This benefited me as, like most of my peers starting university, I was not quite sure about the career in which I would like to work in.

The practical session and lab sessions allow you to really get to know the staff, much more than just the lectures alone.
The staff are always keen to answer questions and to tell you that there is no such thing as a silly question, because it is likely that you are not the only person in the room that may be thinking it!
“In the final year of my course there is a compulsory placement module in which we complete 50 hours of voluntary work experience.
The freedom in which this module allows us to choose a placement in an industry of our choice means it is a great experience.
We can contact the careers service to find out what placement may be most beneficial for the role we are looking to apply for upon graduation.
“There are many opportunities to get real-life, practical experience at Brighton, which makes it stand out against other universities which may not offer this invaluable hands-on experience.”
Dom Mitchell
“I studied Sport and Exercise Science at bachelors level, and then Applied Sports Physiology at masters level.
I chose the course because I loved sport and wanted to pick something that I both enjoy and want to do.
“Practical experience at the university really helped me.
I’m proud of all the tests and lab work that we did where you’re looking at different protocols and different equipment and how to convey that information to a participant.
“What I do now is called respiratory physiology.
So it’s about how healthy your lungs are by looking at airflow through your airways and how efficient your lungs are.

“I chose Sports Management because I was eager to learn more about the business, marketing and entrepreneurial side of sports and be part of the industry working in the sports that I enjoy.
“I chose to study at Brighton as the course is CIMSPA endorsed and gave many opportunities to students compared to other universities
“My placement was at Brighton FootGolf – I learnt about the managerial side of the business and assisted in daily operations and management.
This included activities such as ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for clients, explaining FootGolf rules, handling bookings and inquiries, managing inventory, maintaining equipment and ensuring a professional and safe environment for players.
I also gained hands-on experience in event coordination, customer relations, sport facility management, and helped the manager to open a new FootGolf business in Cambridge.
“The lecturers for sport management are the best!
The course team supported me a lot, especially Dr Marc Keech, as I had him as a lecturer for the three years and most of my modules.
He also played an important part in my dissertation as my supervisor.
“If you are passionate about sports, the Sport Management BSc will help you get involved in a different part of sports from QTS or sports coaching and you will have many opportunities.
“I plan to continue my studies with an MA in Sport Management.”
Eleanor Skipp
“Reflecting on my academic journey at Brighton brings a sense of fondness and achievement.
The Sport Management degree proved to be not only engaging and thought-provoking but also highly relevant to my career, equipping me with both practical working skills and the ability for big-picture thinking and reflective practice.
“The diverse styles and assessment options allowed for creative expression, enabling me to tailor my work to research topics that genuinely sparked my curiosity.
This personalised approach not only increased my motivation but also deepened my comprehension of the subject.
“The lecturers took time to develop individual connections with students, learning our interests and working styles.
I felt supported throughout my degree, not only in academic work but also in post-degree decision making.
“Securing my first job at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games directly resulted from the experience gained during my professional placement.
This experience served as testament to the importance of hands-on learning and practical experience required for working in the sport industry and solidified the theory that was taught in the classroom.
“Since 2022, I have continued in the sport events industry by working for Formula E, the Professional Triathlete Organisation and at various other mass participation events.
Currently, I am delivering the motorsport events at Goodwood – the GRRC Member’s Meeting, the Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival.”
Jaebeom Kim
“I never thought of myself as a proactive person before university, but during my whole academic years I really blossomed in that area.
It also gave me an important insight into other perspectives, broadening my horizons and encouraging people to develop diverse opinions and ideas.
“My degree focused on not only learning the fundamentals, but also on the practical application.
Having a placement was extremely valuable and it benefited me.
I increased understanding and awareness of the work environment, accelerated personal maturity, self-awareness and the ability to articulate skills and achievements.
When I started my career, the placement experiences helped me a lot.
“I am currently working at a football agency called TI Sports cooperation in Korea.
TI Sports is a professional football agency providing sportsperson representation for footballers.
My main job is to concentrate on arranging transfers, media-related matters and sponsorship opportunities.
Furthermore, I actively participate in discovering gifted youth players and promoting their growth in order to contribute to enrich the industry.”
Hannah Foden
“My experience on this course challenged and motivated me to find my passion, interest and niche within the sports industry.
It also allowed me to develop as a person, personally and professionally, mostly because of the support from my course tutors.
“A highlight of my Sport Management degree would be my placement with Active Surrey.
This opportunity enabled me to work as a project coordinator for various teams across the Active Partnership.
I applied my knowledge learnt from a first year module that overviews the sports industry, its sectors and their strategies, and took this forward to a placement organisation that is key for delivering national level strategic objectives for local need.
“During my degree, I utilised what was offered to me, including working with the Students’ Union to set up the University’s first Women in Business society.
My tutors congratulated me on this accomplishment and guided me to further my interest in female empowerment and apply it to my sports business assignments, including my final year dissertation.
“In the process of writing the dissertation, I was very aware of time management and I prioritised feedback from my tutors who were always there with support when I needed it.
I was very pleased to receive a first class grade (84%) for this work too.
“Since completing my degree, I’ve also graduated from Brighton with a masters degree in Social Research Methods.
When I finished my masters, however, I was mostly discussing the experiences from my bachelors course to potential employers as I wanted to, and continue to, pursue work in sports management.
Because of this degree course, I found my niche which is to work in one way or another to further the women’s global sporting movement.
“I am currently interning at the world’s leading sports and entertainment agency, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), in their Sports Talent team.
I’ve learnt lots about commercial sports partnerships with exclusive athletes, particularly with female footballers.
I can only assume that I secured this opportunity because of the successful, engaging and practical degree experience I had at Brighton.”
Tim Cetinich
“For my placement I worked at Football 4 Peace International (F4P), which is an activity-based community relations and reconciliation initiative that brings people together through a variety of sports.
“I was tasked with several projects ranging from organising different events such as the Easter Challenge Camp and the F4P v Homophobia event in partnership with Sussex Downs College (now East Sussex College Group), to coordinating with F4P coaches to work on projects and creating a new coaching kit for the F4P staff.
“I was given the opportunity to go to Berlin to meet with key sport academics at the Humboldt University as well as attending The Commonwealth Secretariat celebration of the second International Day of Sport for Development and Peace.
Luckily I was also able to take part in the F4P project in The Gambia and the project in The Republic of Korea.
“Throughout my placement I gained wider knowledge and experience in the world of sport for development and peace, which enabled me to understand how the business and management elements of a charity organisation work.
This then improved and developed many transferable skills that will be crucial in the future.
“Through the opportunities given to me during my placement, I was able to increase my skills that relate to the sport industry.
Whether through managing different teams for different events, coordinating with sport retail companies to reach an agreement on kit packages or organising an event, the transferable skills gained will help me immensely in the future.”
Georgia Townsend
“I studied Sport Management at the University of Brighton from 2018–2021.
“I enjoyed my experience at the university both socially and academically.
The course was very insightful and provided me with lifelong knowledge within the sports industry.
I was able to take what I had learnt throughout the course and apply it to working in the world of sports development.
“The lecturers on this course also add significant value.
They were always on hand to support me throughout the course.
They have also been very helpful after the course  finished to continue to share their expertise and support with jobs and professional development.
“The degree is endorsed by CIMSPA which allowed for the professional standards of the industry to be embedded throughout.
I believe that this gave me a kickstart in the sector, as I was aware of the skills and attributes that employers from the industry were looking for.
My knowledge of CIMSPA and understanding of what they do for the sports sector led me to gaining a role as a CIMSPA Youth Panel member when I finished university.
I am still an active member on the panel and will continue this role for as long as I can.
“As part of the degree, I completed my placement at Brighton Footgolf.
I thoroughly enjoyed this experience as I was working first-hand within the industry and I am grateful for the skills the placement allowed me to develop.
The placement process was a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills and to use as a talking point in interviews.
I cannot fault this process offered by the university.
I am very thankful for it, and it is a pleasure to now be a placement host for current students.
“Since leaving university, I have worked for Active Kent and Medway and Skiltek Sport.
Active Kent and Medway is an Active Partnership involved in facilitating sport and physical activity participation and it was great being able to go into a role I had lots of knowledge about and to see how an Active Partnership functions from day to day.
“Currently, I am a Sports Development Officer for a sports coaching company, Skiltek Sport.
This role combines the administrative side of the industry with the practical side of delivering sports sessions for children and young people.
Alongside my current role I also coach two girls’ football teams, Hastings United U9s and Sussex Schools U14s.”

Praveen Bhati
“I completed my bachelors in accountancy and, as I wanted to stay away from the corporate world and be close to sports, I decided to pursue sports science.
“The course modules align with UKSCA accreditation and cover the main components of strength and conditioning, with practical experience gained in world-class labs and gym suites.
Access to the sports and science equipment helped me get the technical and practical knowledge which is prominent in today’s advanced S&C practices.
“My placement was with Sussex Cricket – overseeing and guiding academy players during their gym sessions, helping with exercise technique in the absence of a coach, taking players through warm-ups and working on their sprint mechanics.
I also assessed players through various tests like CMJs and sprint tests.
“The university setting provided me with theoretical knowledge and practical experience, but on my placement I was able to use that knowledge in a real professional environment.
Placement experience also helped me learn how sports science departments work, how to develop emotional intelligence in the workplace, and most importantly how to be a team player.
“The course team are the best – they are people who know what they are teaching and are dedicated to their subject and students.
They were always there to help me out, be it an easy or difficult topic.
"I am now working with Indian Paralympian athletes aiming for the world para-athletics championship in October, which would not have been possible without my time studying at the University of Brighton and working at Sussex cricket."
Marcus Condon
“I chose to study strength and conditioning because I wanted to develop my own education and practice around the gym and pitch environment, primarily to improve my own performance – being a semi-professional rugby player.
This quickly evolved and became more about helping others achieve their goals and reach their own potential, something that I have found great pleasure in doing so far.
“My long-term view on my career has changed over the last two years; when studying, I thought I'd always want to work in the professional environment with the best of the best, but as time goes on I see the impact that I can have on the everyday person, and that has slightly skewed my goals.
“I work for Ascend Athlete Performance which is a strength and conditioning company that looks to target both the best athletes and everyday people.
I have also worked as the lead strength and conditioning coach at the University of Brighton as well as at a Chelsea FC Foundation site, alongside working within professional rugby.
My latest role in professional football with Lewes FC Women has diversified my practice by opening doors to a new environment and clientele.
“Studying at Brighton helped to provide me with what I needed to go out into the working world from both educational and practice-based standpoints.
Advancing knowledge and my own philosophy within lectures under very intelligent lecturers set the foundation for my learning to continue.
One uni placement was within a professional rugby academy and another within the university’s own athletic development scene in some great facilities with state-of-the-art equipment.
I am fortunate enough to now say that the network I expanded on whilst at university – including those within the lecturing team – are peers of mine that I can collaborate with in a professional space.”
Ben Sayer
“The facilities were amazing – they were well kitted out and I knew I would get more time in them with a smaller cohort.
The weights, duel force plates and iso-rig made going to the gym lectures very fun.
“I continued my studies straight after my undergraduate degree.
I had developed strong relationships with the staff and had built quite a solid reputation so I thought I would use this to maximise what I got out of my MSc.
I have kept within arms reach of staff since graduating – if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t have the job I have, so I owe them!
“I was employed by Wycombe Wanderers FC on a part-time basis after graduation and was promoted to a full-time role within six months.
I have stayed at Wycombe Wanderers FC the entire time.
“I use what I learnt on the strength and conditioning degree when working with the players on a daily basis.
“I would seriously recommend this university for anyone who is looking for a complete package.”

Santha
“Having studied maths to A-level and worked with numbers throughout my career as an accountant for 25 years, I took the mathematics SKE.
“Being a more mature career changer, I found the studying and subject content very challenging.
All subject tutors were always very encouraging, consistently showed great confidence in my ability and were readily available to help resolve any issues that may have arisen.
“Lesson material was well prepared and informative as was all module information and assignment expectations.
The course staff are all extremely professional, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, inspiring, supportive and kind.
They all had high expectations of students but were always on hand to provide guidance when required.
Emails were promptly replied to and they were readily available at any time to discuss any issues.
“My subject knowledge regarding maths for teaching has developed very well.

“Although I had been an accountant for over 20 years, all of my work was ‘number’ related –I hadn’t looked at the wider topic of maths since I did my GCSE in it 30 years previously.
“All of the seminars were online and the content was both relevant and delivered extremely well, delving into the history of maths and using software to help us which made maths interesting whilst enabling me to access the learning.
“I had two days a week of online seminars which counted as 10 hours towards my 25 hours of study expected per week.
The other 15 hours were self study and I had the flexibility to complete these at a time that suited me.
“I felt very supported – my lecturers and tutor were all very personable and were always willing to answer any questions or give advice about the course or what I could be doing to gain the maximum benefit from it.
“My subject knowledge improved considerably during the course and I felt much more confident in my ability to teach maths to GCSE level.”

The materials for this course were fantastic in terms of showing us ideas for teaching, which I have used during my PGCE.
“The SKE was a really good stepping stone, not only for subject knowledge but also in terms of my teaching practise and being able to be more specific within my reflections.
“We couldn't have asked for more supportive and caring staff.
They were amazing and really made a difference, especially with making sure we communicated and interacted with our peers.
