5 July 2025: UCAS Clearing opens!
Clearing vacancies are displayed in UCAS’s search tool .
14 August 2025: A Level results day.
A Level results are available from 8am – at this point, many students will know if they have been accepted into their firm or insurance places, or whether they want/need to apply to universities through Clearing.
Everyone has their own  reasons for going through the Clearing process, but we’ve broken it down to  five main ones:
Reason 1: You didn’t receive any offers on your original  UCAS application.
Reason 2: On results day, you don’t meet the entry  requirements for your conditional offers.
Reason 3: You haven’t yet applied to university but are  interested in starting this academic year.
Reason 4: You’ve changed your mind about your original  UCAS application and want to attend a different university or study an  alternative course.
Reason 5: You get better grades than predicted and  would like to find a place on a different course with higher entry  requirements.
Depending on the course you are applying for, you may be required to have a phone interview with an academic or submit a portfolio.
If this is the case, you may not receive an offer when you first call us, but we’ll be in touch as soon as a decision has been made.
If your child decides to enter Clearing, they will be looking to you for support.
While you can’t call our Clearing hotline on their behalf, you can help them with their research and preparation.
Results day can be overwhelming, so make sure they take regular breaks and encourage them to carefully consider all the offers they get before making a final decision.
Learn More .
Clearing Plus is an option for anyone who is unsuccessful with their  original UCAS application or is applying to university for the first time  through Clearing.
The UCAS Hub will take your personal information and grades  and will suggest some courses you might like based on what different  universities are looking for.
If you express an interest in a course that’s  recommended to you, the university can contact you.
If you’re eligible for Clearing  Plus , you’ll see a button on your UCAS profile called ‘See matches’.
As well as your results, your UCAS ID number and your contact information, we’d advise having your personal statement to hand, as this can be a great resource to refer to during your call with one of our advisers.
Having your personal statement in front of you will make it easier to talk about why you want to go to university and why you're passionate about the subject you’re enquiring about.
If we’re unable to accept you on to your original course, we may offer you an alternative option instead.
However, if we can’t provide you with a place, or you decline the offer for an alternative course, you’ll be released so you can enter Clearing or accept your insurance place.
If you’re unsure about what your future career looks like, or you don't  have the right qualifications to get you started with an undergraduate degree,  you could consider an Integrated  Foundation Year.
It’s the perfect stepping-stone to help you achieve your dreams, and we  have plenty of courses to choose from.
Our clearing hotline is operating on extended evening and weekend opening hours in August.
Please see this page for the full list of opening times.

There are two types of loans you may be able to apply for - tuition fee and maintenance loans.
There are no age limits on eligibility for tuition fee loans and government maintenance grants, so mature students can apply – provided this is your first degree.
Tuition Fee Loans
Full-time students from the UK can apply for a tuition fee loan up to £9,250.
This is paid directly to the university each year and is not dependent on your household income.
Maintenance Loans
You can apply for a maintenance loan to assist with meeting living costs such as food, accommodation, and travel expenses.
These are normally paid in three instalments throughout the university year directly to your bank account.
If you have undertaken any other previous Higher Education study, it is important to be aware that this can sometimes have an impact on the student funding, including tuition fee loans, available to you when you start a new course.
This is a complex area.
If you are not sure of your entitlement to funding, it is important that you seek advice from your funding organisation or with a Student Money Adviser who can clarify exactly how your previous study will impact your future student funding entitlement.

At the local level, it has been used to make decisions on UK reintroductions of the lynx and beaver, and to implement species reintroduction and community engagement programmes for some of the UK’s most deprived communities.
At the global level, it has underpinned rewilding policy at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and prompted the organisation to issue new definitions, guidelines, and standards.
These will support the international conservation community to use rewilding strategies as means of addressing global declines in biodiversity and reconnecting people with nature.

Conserving Marine Mammals and their Habitat Through Better Understanding of their Behaviour and the Effect of Noise Pollution
Through Associate Professor Volker Deecke, the University of Cumbria is involved in national and international collaborative research on the behaviour, ecology, and communication of marine mammals, particularly focused on resolving conservation issues related to the effect of underwater noise on marine mammal behaviour.
This research has influenced government policy by informing endangered species legislation and guidance in Canada, Iceland, the USA, and the UK.
This includes research leading to a 67% increase in size of designated critical habitat for endangered killer whales in Canadian waters.
The research has also influenced stakeholder behaviour by informing best practice regarding marine mammal research and raising public awareness.
Lead Academic: Associate Professor Volker Deecke .
Currency Innovation Research Shapes Global Policy and Local Enterprise
Our research is informing both the development and the regulation of new currencies to alleviate social and environmental challenges.
At the local level, it supported the non-governmental organisation Grassroots Economics to improve the lives of thousands of the poorest people in Kenya by expanding new currencies that facilitate their livelihoods.
This included launching currencies in 44 other poor communities, further reducing poverty.
At the global level, the research has explained the promise and limitations of currency innovation, influencing a United Nations (UN) agency to adopt the topic within its regulatory guidance to help countries to write their laws.
This included exploring policy options with UN member states at the World Investment Forum, the largest gathering of trade officials in the world.
Lead Academic: Professor Jem Bendell .
Influencing and Shaping Public Policies to Benefit Local and Regional Economies
The Centre for Regional Economic Development (CRED) has conducted research on spatial patterns of economic development and the effectiveness of policies designed to correct unequal performance at various scales.
Research has been conducted on the design and effectiveness of business support in peripheral regions and the relatively poor performance of the rural economy in the north of England and the Anglo-Scottish Borderlands.
CRED research has contributed significantly to the evidence-base used to support the Borderlands Growth Deal, the Local Industrial Strategy for Cumbria, and strategies to address worklessness in West Cumbria.
At the European level, research on variations in research and innovation performance has been used by the European Commission to identify target countries for programmes under Horizon Europe designed to reduce innovation divides across the European Union.
The findings have influenced decisions on the allocation of funding between Member States to support research development under Horizon Europe 2021-2027.

Working with Victims, Service Users, and Service Providers to Improve Men’s Experiences of Domestic Violence
Our research on male victims of domestic violence has raised awareness and improved understanding of men’s experiences.
It has challenged accepted practice and public perceptions that women are primarily victims; elevating the experience of male victims to inform legislation, governmental policies, and service provision.
Furthermore, the research has impacted directly on male victims, leading to an increased number of men seeking support, stimulating new recognition of the issue and empowering individual efforts to raise awareness.
National and international media recognition linked to the research evidences the ways in which male victims are entering the public discourse around domestic violence.
This has an inevitable impact of raising the profile of men’s experiences, and therefore, the support provided.
Lead Academic: Dr Elizabeth Bates .
Research on Adopting ‘Teleswallowing’ and ‘Fetal Telemedicine’ has Improved Patient Access to Specialist Services
Research undertaken by Bidmead and Marshall at the University of Cumbria (UOC) facilitated adoption of two telemedicine services (remote clinical consultations via video) at several NHS Trusts.
The research developed a methodology to understand stakeholder engagement with digital innovations and overcome barriers to adoption.
Teleswallowing fast-tracks assessment and treatment for patients with dysphagia (swallowing problems).
The service was adopted by Blackpool NHS Foundation Trust, a provider to 445,000 residents, and later by two other providers: Isle of Wight NHS Trust (140,000 residents) and Hobbs Rehabilitation (specialist service across the south of England).
NHS England recommended Teleswallowing as the default approach for swallowing assessments under the Covid-19 control measures in April 2020.
Fetal Telemedicine enables remote, shared consultations for fetal ultrasound.
Its adoption facilitates local access to specialist expertise for pregnant women and staff in North Cumbria, serving a population of 500,000 people.
Fetal Telemedicine was adopted by the collaborating Trusts and the service extended to another rural hospital, improving services for patients.
Lead Academics: Professor Alison Marshall and Dr Elaine Bidmead .
The Impact of Research on Residential Experiences Effecting Change in Outdoor Learning Policy and Practice
Our research has identified the key social and cognitive outcomes of residential experiences.
It has led directly to policy development for high quality residential experiences in the outdoors by national organisations and international government departments; embedded and extended provision of residential experiences for children and young people across an increased range of providers; and, enhanced provision of support for national and international practitioners on best practice in outdoor learning.
The impact of this research is on policy and practice in outdoor learning for education providers, children and young people in the UK, Taiwan, and Singapore.
Lead Academics: Professor Heather Prince and Professor Chris Loynes .
Making Educational Practice Equitable: Challenging Stakeholders’ Attitudes Towards Promoting Fundamental British Values and Prevent Strategy
Our collaborative research revealed the negative effects of the current UK Counter terrorism legislation on education and challenged stakeholders’ understanding of how the Prevent Strategy (PS) and the promotion of Fundamental British values (FBV) in educational settings has been counterproductive – stigmatising and silencing the Muslim community and fuelling dangerous nationalistic and racist attitudes.
The research influenced teacher educators, student, and classroom teachers to re appraise and/or change established thought, policy, and practice in regard to FBV/PS.
A review commissioned by an independent government committee has utilised the research to make recommendations that FBV/PS is divisive and counter-productive and that the teaching of FBVs in school should be reviewed.
Finally, community and County Council leaders have utilised the research to consider how PS and FBV might not serve the best interests of the communities they serve.
Lead Academic: Professor Sally Elton-Chalcraft .
Cumbrian Alchemy: The Influence of Art Practices on the Management of Nuclear Sites and Development of Nuclear Markers to Warn Future Civilizations
The collaborative art project Cumbrian Alchemy (CA) has influenced the discourses surrounding Nuclear Cultures/Nuclear Anthropocene, highlighting the role and contribution of art practices to the management of nuclear sites and in developing suitable markers to warn civilizations about nuclear waste (potentially thousands of years in the future).
This has included CA contributing to guidance issued by the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) to reduce inadvertent human intrusion of nuclear repositories and to support future society to make informed decisions about these sites after closure (NEA members account for 85% of global nuclear capacity).
Further, CA has influenced nuclear practice and discourse in Cumbria (the site of the UK’s first nuclear power station), and through public engagement, has increased understanding around nuclear cultures and enhanced cultural preservation of artefacts, folklore, and myths.
Selection in the Arts Catalyst funded Perpetual Uncertainty programme, enabled CA to tour in Sweden and Belgium reaching 187,112 exhibition visitors and 11,182 through engagement/outreach.

The University of Cumbria was formed in 2007 by the merger of St Martin’s College, Cumbria Institute of the Arts and University of Central Lancashire’s Cumbria sites, operating from campuses spread across Cumbria and North Lancashire.
We may be a relatively new university, but we are steeped in history dating right the way back to 1822.
The university is continuing to grow, expanding in geographical terms as well as academic scope.
Cumbria Institute of the Arts has a long history in Carlisle which began with the establishment of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in October 1822.
A new Academy of Arts was established in 1823 and in 1950 was renamed as the Carlisle College of Art.
The institution was officially designated a higher education institute on 1 August 1997.
To reflect its academic growth and development, the institution gained approval from the privy council to change its name to Cumbria Institute of the Arts in 2002.
The institution was a founding member of AGHEC (Advisory Group for Higher Education in Cumbria) which was established in July 1999 by HEFCE to include the HEIs represented in Cumbria, Cumbria County Council and the North West Regional Development Agency.
In 2003, AGHEC transferred into University Education in Cumbria (UeC) working with Sir Brian Fender.
The work undertaken by UeC underpins the current establishment of the University of Cumbria.
The Lancaster campus of the University of Cumbria started life as a barracks for the King's Own Royal Regiment and it was this association which gave the teaching college its name - St.
Martin's - after a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity.
With the kind permission of the Museum for the King's Own Royal Regiment we have a gallery of images from their archive and a collection from our own.
The King’s Own Royal Regiment vacated the barracks and the site was purchased by the Church of England.
Former armouries, barracks and other buildings were converted and others demolished to be replaced by new buildings designed by Charles Pike.
Post-war review of teacher training led to the instigation of Lancaster College of Education 1962.
The first intake of 89 students (supported by 13 staff) was in 1964.
From the start, the college planned to teach degrees as well as Certificates of Education and pioneered the four year BA Hons with QTS.
By 1966 the college was teaching PGCE students.
The college developed courses in nursing and later radiography, occupational health, social work and continuing professional development courses for health professionals.
Strong relationships were forged with NHS trust training departments, and many health professionals can be seen proudly wearing both St.
Martin’s and University of Cumbria badges on their uniforms to this day.
The college developed courses in humanities, arts and sport, and a mini building boom ensued in the late 1990s with the development of the Sports Centre, Humanities building, Hugh Pollard Lecture Theatre and new accommodation.
In the late 1990s St.
Martin's took over the management of Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside.
The London campuses followed, strengthening the emphasis on teaching.
The acquisition of the former hospital buildings at Fusehill Street in Carlisle saw the expansion of health, teaching, arts, humanities and business courses in Cumbria.
The Carlisle campus developed with new halls of residence, a sport centre and in 2006 the Learning Gateway building.
In 2006 the College embarked on its journey to secure University Title and Taught Degree Awarding Powers (TDAP).
Following review by the Quality Assurance Agency the College received approval from the Privy Council on 10th July 2006 in respect of TDAP.

Born in 1842, Charlotte Mason was an experienced school teacher who passionately believed in the importance of education for all members of society regardless of gender or social class.
Charlotte’s philosophy was that children should be valued as people and should be educated through real situations.
After 15 years of teaching at primary level, Charlotte began to publish her ideas on childhood education and subsequently published regularly in Parents' Review.
In 1891 she moved to Ambleside and set up a training school.
After her death the school was managed by the county until the 1990’s when it became part of Lancaster University.
St.
Martin’s College took over the management of the college in the late 1990s.
During this period the Charlotte Mason building was built; a home for the library and student resources.
At the same time outdoor courses were developed from Hill Top building and business courses at the former Kelsick School building, a short distance from the main campus.
Ambleside continues to host courses in outdoors, business, leadership and sustainability.
For more information on Charlotte Mason’s heritage visit the Armitt Website .
In 2012 we launched our innovative Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS) at our Ambleside campus .
Major redevelopment work of the Ambleside campus started the following year, and in 2014 the Lake District campus officially became home to the National School of Forestry , the Centre for Wildlife Conservation and our outdoor studies courses - more outdoor students study with us than with any other higher education institution in Europe.
The university’s commitment to provision in London continued, with its campus (originally created by St.
Martin’s College) relocating to new premises in East India Dock Road in 2013.
Other developments in 2013 included the creation of our University of Cumbria Business School at our Lancaster campus and the launch of Carlisle Business Interaction Centre at Paternoster Row.
Lord Digby Jones visited our Ambleside campus in 2014 to officially launch our Rural Growth Hub – a new facility designed to help business thrive in the National Park.
One of our major goals is to grow university participation in west Cumbria.
Since 2009 we have been delivering courses at Energus, Workington , and in 2013 we opened our University Centre at Furness College , Barrow-in-Furness.

The UK REF have released further details in December 2023 of the upcoming research evaluation exercise.
The details include an announcement to extend the timing for the next REF exercise to 2029.
Work is underway to develop and revise some areas of the detail for a REF 2029 exercise.
A further update is expected in spring 2025.
The purpose of REF includes assessing the quality and ‘excellence’ of research taking place across UK universities, informing the allocation of Quality Research (QR) funding and providing accountability for the public investment made in research.
The three domains previously used in REF2014 and REF2021 have been retitled and have had their content and weightings adjusted to reflect their broader remits.
Please note, some of the below detail is subject to change as we await further guidance on the newly proposed REF 2029 exercise:
Contribution to knowledge and understanding (50% weighting).
This domain replaces the Outputs element.
It will primarily assess research outputs and will also include evidence of wider contributions to the development of a discipline.
People, culture and environment (25% weighting).
This domain replaces the environment element and will be expanded to assess both institutional and disciplinary level research culture.
Engagement and impact (25% weighting).
This domain replaces the impact element, to consider both engagement and impact through impact case studies and an accompanying statement at disciplinary level.
The below table outlines the key decisions taken by the funding bodies for REF2029.
Please note, some of this detail is now subject to change as we await further guidance on the newly proposed REF 2029 exercise:
REF 2029 will retain the REF 2021 Unit of Assessment structure and will include advisory panels on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, and Interdisciplinary research.
Institutions will not submit staff to REF 2029.
Staff data will be gathered directly from HESA to determine the volume.
REF 2021 staff eligibility criteria will be used to identify staff posts that contribute to the volume measure.
REF 2029 will fully break the link between individual staff members and unit submissions.
Institutions may submit outputs produced by any staff member where there is a demonstrable and substantive link to the submitting institution within the REF assessment period.
There will be no minimum or maximum output requirements for individual staff members.
However, units will be required to explain how their submitted output pool is representative of the research undertaken within the disciplinary area.
There will be no process to account for individual equality-related circumstances.
REF 2029 will include consideration of the impact of equality-related circumstances within an overall process for determining potential reductions in output requirements at submission level.
The process will not be based on the aggregation of individual equality-related circumstances.
The REF2021 Open Access Policy applies for now; new requirements are due to be published in Spring 2024.
The focus of the environment element will be expanding to People, Culture and Environment (PCE), making up 25% of overall quality profile.
PCE will be assessed at both disciplinary and institutional level.
The RKE Directorate will work closely with academic and professional services colleagues to develop our submission to the exercise.
The RKE team are happy to talk to colleagues about REF, please email research.office@cumbria.ac.uk .
You can read further detail about the initial decisions and next steps released by REF in December 2023 here .
These pages will be updated as further information on REF2029 is published.

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the University of Cumbria’s Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the financial year ending 31 July 2024.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.
It takes various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
This statement provides information about the University and its policy and practices to prevent modern slavery in its business and supply chains.
The University of Cumbria is a UK Higher Education Institution providing a wide range of teaching, research and related activities.
We have campuses in Carlisle, Ambleside, Lancaster and London and are developing a campus in Barrow.
The University operates from other sites in the UK and overseas through partnership and collaboration arrangements with education providers and other organisations.
The University of Cumbria is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity.
We had income of £78.3m and over 10,000 registered students in 2023/24.
The overall responsibility for the strategy and control of the University of Cumbria rests with the University’s Board of Directors.
As part of their oversight of the University’s approach to preventing modern slavery, they review and approve a Modern Slavery statement each year, following scrutiny by the University’s Audit and Risk Committee.
The University is committed to combatting slavery and human trafficking in all its business practices.
We have established a formal Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and Procedure which sets out our approach to this and have ensured that this approach is embedded across related policies and procedures and that it has a focus on our staff, supply chain and students.
Staff
The People and Culture team at the University are responsible for the recruitment, appointment and well-being of University staff, under the leadership of the Director of People and Culture.
They provide oversight, management and risk management across a range of policies, processes and procedures which act to ensure that modern slavery related risks are mitigated, including through:
The University may on occasion use agencies to provide temporary staff or may sub-contract some activities.
In such cases, the suppliers of these services are required to conduct requisite employment checks and demonstrate compliance with duties under the Modern Slavery Act.
Supply Chain
The requirement to act ethically and safeguard human rights in the supply chain forms part of our Procurement Policy and we manage expenditure robustly in line with this policy.
The University purchases a wide range of goods and services and we are committed to enforcing effective controls to minimise the risk of modern slavery taking place.
During procurement exercises, potential modern slavery risks are identified and a due diligence approach adopted.
Suppliers are asked to provide evidence for review that demonstrates adherence to anti-slavery principles and practices and to the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act.
All suppliers are encouraged to register with the NET Positive Supplier Engagement (HE) Tool, allowing the University to access data regarding the supplier’s approach in this area, including within their supply chain, and to review and discuss their action plans.
There is added scrutiny of suppliers which provide goods or services that are deemed to be “higher risk” in terms of the potential for modern slavery to occur.
Our risk assessment of the supplier base was updated in 2023/24 and identified the following categories of expenditure as being “higher risk”:
The University’s use of procurement frameworks helps mitigate key modern slavery risks and provides assurance to the University of supplier compliance.
The University conducts much of this procurement via the North-West Universities Purchasing Consortium (NWUPC), who act to collate information prior to tender award on first and second tier supply chain and then work with suppliers post contract to encourage them to look beyond their statements and conduct robust analysis of their supply chains to identify areas of risk and the actions they are taking in mitigation.
Students
The University ensures that modern slavery risks to our students are considered as part of our wider approach to the Safeguarding, with a specific focus on this area within our Safeguarding and Prevent Policy.
In order to ensure an ongoing focus on such risks, the University’s operational lead for modern slavery is a member of the Safeguarding Steering Group.
The University is committed to awareness raising and training in this area.
In the current year, this has included the completion of a training course provided by the 4 British Universities Finance Director’s Group by the procurement team and other key staff and a University wide message which explained what modern slavery is, made clear the University’s approach and requested all staff to view a short video which explored the major indicators that it may be taking place.
This was issued to coincide with Anti-Slavery Day in October.
During the current year, we have completed the following key actions to further develop our approach to modern slavery:
During 2024/25, we will:
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and has been approved by the University Board of Directors.
It constitutes the University of Cumbria's Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the financial year ending 31st July 2023.

Embarking on your journey to university is an exciting milestone.
Two key steps will play a big role in your success: crafting a memorable personal statement and acing your university interview (if applicable).
These moments are your chance to showcase who you are and why you’re a perfect fit for your course.
In this blog post, we’ll break down the essentials of writing a personal statement that makes you stand out from the crowd and aligns with what Admissions Teams are looking for.
Plus, we’ll share our top tips for preparing for university interviews.
So grab a notebook and let’s dive in!
An undergraduate personal statement is an important part of the university application process.
It's your chance to talk about your experiences, interests and passions outside of school or college.
Your personal statement can't be longer than 4,000 characters (which is around two sides of A4), so you'll need to think carefully about how you're going to structure your statement in order to fit everything in you want to say.
There's no right or wrong way to lay out your personal statement, but it can help to split it into four paragraphs:
A clear introduction : Don't overthink your introduction.
Admissions Tutors simply want to see your enthusiasm for the subject, so think about what interests you most about the course you're applying for and why you have chosen it.
A section dedicated to your achievements : Your personal statement is your chance to share any experience you have of the subject that isn’t already on your UCAS application.
For example, work experience, placements, and relevant activities at school.
A section about your interests outside of school/college : Use this paragraph to showcase your passion and really demonstrate who you are.
If you have hobbies or extra-curricular activities related to the subject, include them here - particularly those that show you are a reliable and responsible person.
A memorable conclusion : Share your goal of attending university and what your hopes are for the future.
If possible, include a memorable closing sentence - you want to make an impact on Admissions Tutors.
Here are 6 things to bear in mind when writing your personal statement:
For some of our courses here at the University of Cumbria, the application process also includes an interview .
While every interview is different depending on the course you have applied for, there are a few things you can do in advance to help prepare.

If you are the parent, carer or supporter of a student who is holding a conditional university offer, A Level results day (14 August 2025) is when they’ll find out if they’ve secured a place with their firm choice.
While for many, this is a time for celebration, for others, it can be an uncertain period.
If your prospective student doesn’t get their predicted grades, changes their mind on where they want to study, or exceeds expectations with their exam results, they may wish to look for another place in Clearing.
Not sure what Clearing is or how it works?
Here’s all you need to know.
Clearing matches undergraduate applicants who want a place at university with universities who have spaces on their courses.
Your prospective student can apply through Clearing if:
If your prospective student is waiting for their A Level results, they won't be able to apply through Clearing until results day, but they can do some research into universities and Clearing courses before this.
If they already have their grades, they can apply through Clearing from 05 July 2025.
There are a few ways your prospective student can apply to the University of Cumbria in Clearing:
Online: The first option is for them to complete our online application form.
It’s important that they provide all the necessary information and upload the relevant documentation.
A member of our Clearing team will be in touch once their application has been processed.
Telephone: Alternatively, your prospective student can call our Clearing hotline on 0808 178 7373.
One of our Clearing advisors will be happy to discuss their options with them before guiding them through the application process.
Via Clearing Plus: If your prospective student was unsuccessful with their original UCAS application, they have the option of using Clearing Plus, a tool on UCAS Hub.
Clearing Plus works by taking their previous course choices and cross-referencing these with similar courses that are still available in Clearing.
If they are interested in a course that’s recommended to them, they can express an interest with the university on UCAS.
For more information on how to apply to Cumbria in Clearing, visit our Clearing page.
Get to know how Clearing works
One of the best ways to help your prospective student through Clearing is to familiarise yourself with the process.
Make sure you know the key dates of Clearing, how the application process works, and what personal details they need to have on hand when they contact universities.
Help them with their research
Most universities release their course vacancies in July, giving your prospective student plenty of time to research different courses and universities.
As well as looking at module content, graduate opportunities and placement options, make sure they understand what the student experience is like at the universities they’re considering.
What are the accommodation options ?
What support services are available?
What groups and societies can they join?
Gather their essential information
Before your prospective student starts contacting universities, make sure they have all their essential information written down.
They’ll need their UCAS ID (if they have one), details of their qualifications (including GCSEs and equivalent results), and their preferred contact information.
You cannot contact universities on your prospective student’s behalf – they must do this themselves – but you can stay with them for moral support.
You can remind them of what's in their personal statement and prompt them to ask any questions they don't know the answers to.
Check UCAS
If your prospective student applied to university via UCAS, they’ll be able to check the status of their application on the UCAS Hub from around 8.00 am on results day.
They won’t be able to see their exam results here, but if decisions have been made by their university choices, they can expect to see the following changes to their offers:
Be patient with them
Results day is nerve-wracking, and if your prospective student doesn't get the grades they were hoping for, they may be upset.
Give them the space they need to absorb their results and let them know you're proud of what they've achieved.
Once they're ready, discuss their options with them.
Encourage them to keep going
Clearing can be overwhelming, even if your prospective student has spent time preparing for it.
Provide them with drinks and snacks and encourage them to take regular breaks away from their screen.
Make sure they don’t rush their decision – they might be tempted to accept the first offer they receive in Clearing, but it’s important that they take a step back and really consider what is the best option for them.
Confirm their offer
Once your prospective student has an offer, they will receive an email from the university confirming what they need to do next.
If they applied to university via UCAS, they can add a Clearing choice to their UCAS Hub from 2.00 pm on A Level results day.
If they applied directly to the university in Clearing, the Admissions team will explain how they can accept their offer.
Update Student Finance
If they’ve already applied for Student Finance, they’ll need to log into their account and update their application with the details of their new course and university.
If they haven’t applied for Student Finance yet, they’ll need to do this as soon as possible to give them the best chance of receiving their loan in time for the start of their course.
To start a Student Finance application, they need to visit the GOV.UK website .
Visit the university
If you’re able to visit the university before September, we’d really recommend doing so.

View Course Details
I’m currently studying Diagnostic Radiography at the University of Cumbria, and I applied through Clearing in 2023.
It was a last-minute decision because I didn’t achieve the grades I had hoped for on results day.
Luckily, I already had a good understanding of how Clearing worked since we covered it during college, and I had researched it myself as a backup plan in case things didn’t go as expected.
On results day, I had a list of universities I was interested in and used my laptop and phone to call them one by one.
It was a mix of emotions — I was upset about my grades, nervous about making those calls, and anxious about whether any university would accept me.
But I would definitely recommend applying through Clearing to others!
Clearing is a great option if your original plans don’t work out, especially because many course requirements are lowered on the day.
It’s worth calling up your chosen universities to check availability and browsing UCAS to see what’s open.
My advice is to have your Clearing number handy, along with your grades and qualifications ready to share.
What I enjoy most about my course is the perfect balance between learning practical skills and understanding the science behind them, especially anatomy.
Having placements where I can apply and improve these skills has been invaluable.
At the University of Cumbria, I appreciate the small, tight-knit community where everyone is friendly and willing to support one another.
In my first year, I stayed in university accommodation, but many of my friends commuted.
Due to placement locations, I decided in my second year to commute as well — first by train and then by car — which I find much better for me now.

I didn’t know a lot about Clearing before the process, only that it was an option, but thankfully it was easy to navigate, and I was able to find both a course and university well suited to my interests.
I applied by phoning the hotline and wound up speaking to one of the Biomedical Science lecturers!
I unfortunately wasn’t going to be free for the open day the following weekend, but he was kind enough to offer to show me around.
So, on results day, I drove over to the campus and had a look around.
I decided there that Cumbria was the place for me.
I would definitely recommend Clearing, it’s a great way to scout out your options!
You can apply for a bunch of courses, and you don’t have to accept straight away; there’s still a bit of time to think about it and consider which university is the best choice for you.
Make sure you look at different universities and different courses.
If things don’t go your way on results day, try not to be too disheartened.
Look into how Clearing works before results day to familiarise yourself with the process, and try not to get too stressed, the staff are there to help you!

Our degree course has been designed by professional zoologists with a real understanding of what the world needs from zoologists and what zoologists need to pursue a professional career.
It mirrors closely the QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Biosciences.
In addition to the formal background “backbone” knowledge all zoologists require, our degree allows you to explore more specialist areas.
To encompass the main patterns of employment, you are given the flexibility to focus on a “whole animal” or a “bits of animals” approach.
The latter provides the skills required to pursue laboratory and experimental pathways such as disease research, DNA technologies and wildlife forensics.
The “whole animal” pathway trains you to become proficient in the identification and study of wild animals, especially British wildlife.
Even within the same subject, degrees at different universities tend to have differing flavours and priorities.
Our degree is delivered by a research active team with diverse interests and particular 3 strengths in animal behaviour, ornithology, entomology and applied zoology.
We draw upon our own experience of working in zoology and related sectors in the UK, across Europe and around the world – these experiences are utilised in specific optional modules allowing you to choose according to your own areas of interest as you progress.
On successful completion of the programme, it is expected that you will understand the key anatomical and physiological attributes of each animal group and why these have led to their success and analyse, synthesise and evaluate knowledge, ideas and experiences and apply them in an appropriate context.
Analysis of zoological data, writing of formal reports and careful design of scientific methods particularly with regards animal surveying are all key transferable skills, which translate into a range of careers in biological sciences.
Formal work is assessed throughout the degree, and you are encouraged to keep lab books which contain working documents of lab practicals, observations and illustrations of dissection work for example.

I am leader of the BSc Zoology programme and enjoy teaching across (nearly) all of the modules but my favourites are ‘Zoological Monitoring Techniques’ where we get to do lots of fieldwork and learn about how to monitor some of the great wildlife across Cumbria, and ‘Challenges for Global Biodiversity’ where we get to discuss and debate how we can better look after biodiversity around the world.
The students always bring great passion and fantastic ideas to these sessions, and I enjoy facilitating their discussions.
Dr Richard Francksen
Much of my teaching is on my specialist topic of animal behaviour, leading the modules: Animal Behaviour, Behavioural Ecology and Behavioural Applications for Conservation.
I am also interested in evolution; therefore, I lead the modules Animal Form and Function and Vertebrate Zoology.
My lifelong interest in the natural world means I am also the leader of the British Wildlife module.
I also contribute to several other modules where I teach statistical modelling techniques: Exploring Research and Professional Skills for Zoologists.

New sentences found on https://cumbria.ac.uk/blog/articles/what-degree-should-i-do-top-tips-for-choosing-your-university-degree-subject.html:
Choosing what degree to study is exciting, but it’s natural to feel uncertain too.
You’ll typically spend 3-4 years studying your chosen course, and your degree will open doors for you in your future career, so it’s important to think carefully about your decision.
To help you decide on your next steps, these are our top tips for how to choose what university degree to do.
In your education up until now, you might have been used to studying multiple subjects, but at university you’ll usually specialise in one or two subjects to develop a deeper understanding, knowledge and skill set.
Given this, have a think about which subjects you'd enjoy devoting all your study time to.
You might have a hobby you enjoy in your free time, but it might lose its appeal if you study it full time, in which case it's probably best to keep it as a hobby.
Don’t forget to consider your strengths, too – no one enjoys getting grades that are worse than they’d hoped for!
You’ll also want to pass your degree modules to ensure you can progress within the course and ultimately graduate successfully.
If you find something you both enjoy and are good at, that's the sweet spot!
Looking to the future can be daunting, especially if you’re still in school, sixth form or college, but you won’t be expected to have your entire career mapped out at this stage.
However, some careers have specific degree requirements, so considering your career goals can help narrow down your choices.
Once you have a better understanding of your interests, strengths and career goals, it’s time to explore the subjects available.
Dig into the prospectus and course webpages of the universities you’re interested in – you might be surprised by the range of subjects you can specialise in.
At the University of Cumbria, we offer everything from Midwifery to Business, Computer Science, Film and Television, and more!
Download our prospectus here .
While you're there, check out the entry requirements for the courses that pique your interest, and compare these to your actual and expected qualifications.
You can find these in the prospectus and on our course webpages.
If you don’t quite meet the entry requirements of your chosen course(s), don’t panic.
Many of our degrees can be accessed with lower entry requirements by taking an integrated foundation year, which is an additional year at the start of your course where you’ll gain the skills, knowledge and experience needed to progress onto the full degree programme.
To find these, look for ‘With Integrated Foundation Year’ in degree titles on our website and in our prospectus.
In addition, if you’re aged 21 or over, our admissions team uses a contextual admissions policy.
This means that certain contextual factors will be taken into account alongside your qualifications when assessing your application, and the admissions team will look for your potential when making admissions decisions.
At this stage, you'll probably have a shortlist of courses you are interested in and eligible to apply for.
Delve deeper to look into exactly what these programmes involve.
Module breakdowns are a great place to start – you can find these in the ‘Course Overview’ section of each of the course pages on our website.
Another important consideration is whether your shortlisted courses involve practice placements.
If they do, find out how much time is spent on placement, and think about whether this sounds enjoyable and would fit into your lifestyle.
On some degrees, such as Nursing and Diagnostic Radiography, half of your time will be spent on placement.
Although placements aren't everyone's cup of tea, for many they can be really rewarding experiences.
There’s only so far you can get online or by reading a prospectus.
To get a real feel for your chosen course and university, book an open day.
There, you'll find out more detail about what it's like to be a student on the course, you'll be able to chat to an academic who teaches the programme, and you'll also have an opportunity to ask any questions you might have.
Exploring the campus and surrounding area is always fun, too!
Discover our open days here .

I think it is a life changing experience because it helps you grow as an independent individual, no matter what degree you are studying.
I knew that university would open an avenue of opportunities, but what I never realised is how big the avenue was, and how much I can progress even after completing my degree.
Well first, putting aside the education, I think we can all appreciate how beautiful the campus is, and how aesthetic the town of Lancaster is, with its amazing views and activities!
I always preferred a small, quiet environment, where the lecturers interact with you, and get to know you on a personal level.
You can count on the universities helping hand, whether it is regarding educational support, or even general health- there is always someone there!
The resources the university provides are endless, and I never even discovered half of these resources until I was in my final year, when I needed it the most.
I chose Diagnostic Radiography as a career because I always wanted to work in healthcare helping patients.
The world of radiography is so fast moving, with constant new developing technology, and there is always something to look forward to, because of ongoing research in medical imaging.
Daily, we meet so many different patients, all with various stories.
To us, we are taking an x-ray, or performing a certain scan, but to the patient, that image taken could be life changing, and we do not appreciate this enough.
We don’t realise how much of a difference one of our x-rays can make, and a lot of the time, our patients are thankful for all we do.
This difference we make is the reason I chose this course.
I love helping people and knowing that I have had a positive effect on even one person’s life is enough for me.
As a part of this course, we must complete a certain set of placement hours, throughout all 3 years, and this is my favourite part.
I am putting all of what I learn into the real world and dealing with actual patients, although this might sound terrifying, the job itself is so rewarding!
You meet various people and gain a lot of advice from your professional colleagues.
This helped me develop a diverse set of skills, which I now use in my everyday practice.
I had my breakthrough moment in my second year of this course, when pretty much 99% of my course was taught through live online sessions, and my efforts pulled through in my grades.
It gave me the confidence to go into my third year and ready to tackle any obstacle that came into my way.
Honestly, ENJOY IT!
Enjoy your time as a student!
Starting university can be daunting, especially if you are moving away from your friends and family, but I promise you make new friends straight away, and this is coming from someone who was in the same position 3 years ago.
If you are planning on going to university, I would advise you to look around at various courses.
Attend shadowing days to see whether the course would suit you (for healthcare) and seek guidance from your careers team or, contact the university directly if you are feeling super eager!
In terms of the educational side of things, don’t be afraid to ask questions during lectures, and always keep on top of your notes.
I had a lecturer that once said to me “Be kind to your future self”, and that has stuck with me for these past 3 years.
I always try and do my work as little and often as I can, and it has honestly saved me from the (forbidden) cramming, which all students love to do.
Making checklists has always helped me, because even if I ticked one thing off the list, I still feel like I achieved something from my day.
As I am writing this, I am about to hand in my final set of assignments and sit my final set of exams, as well as (hopefully) have a job lined up for myself, as I transition into my first post as a Diagnostic Radiographer.
It has been a very hard journey, however, one that I will always remember as one of the biggest achievements of my life.
Being a student at Cumbria really helped me develop into the young professional I have always dreamed of being.
From the moment I had my first lecture back in 2019, through all the various placements that I have had, up to the moment of me typing this, I have always had the support of my lecturers, and I can’t thank them enough for their encouragement and determination to help me get to where I am today.

Feeling quite uninspired after two years of sixth form, notwithstanding positive results, I wasn’t fervent about the idea of continuing academic studies; however, after a period of deliberation concerning what might be next, I was enthused when I realised the array of courses that the University of Cumbria had to offer, drawing prospective students away from traditional studies into a blend of theory and practice that would truly unlock potential career pathways.

I was going to a physiotherapist due to a persistent shoulder injury, and the physiotherapist explained in a lot of detail what could be the issue, and that some of my symptoms were connected to a different cause and not the initial injury.
The physio then proceeded to use manipulation techniques on my neck to stop numbness in my hand.
This completely blew me away, her understanding and her knowledge of anatomy, as well as neural anatomy, and now – after being on the course for two years – I understand exactly what dermatomal pattern my numbness was in and which nerve route she manipulated.

Woodlands need to adapt to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and experts in forest science can help them do this.
Perhaps most importantly of all, researchers and managers are needed to help trees, woods and forests combat climate change through their mitigation potential.
You are increasingly being expected to understand the best ways to maximise how trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through net photosynthesis, how they can store the greatest amount of carbon in their ecosystems, especially in the soil, and how wood products can substitute for higher carbon footprint materials to give a carbon substitution effect.
Our future depends on our capacity to combat climate change, arguably the greatest challenge of our times, but because managing woodlands is one of the only ways of actually removing some of our greenhouse gas emissions that are already in the atmosphere, you will have vital expertise to offer as practitioners, researchers, teachers and policy makers in your future career.

What’s more, you don't have to start paying them back until you are earning over a government-mandated salary threshold.
In most cases, you won’t start repaying your student loan until you have been teaching for a while and have progressed in your career.
Although some schools are permitted to employ teaching staff who are not formally qualified, most state schools require QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).
Moreover, undertaking formal training prepares you to be a dynamic, capable teacher and increases your chances of employment.
The large proportion of trainee teachers are graduates undertaking a PGCE qualification, however, at the University of Cumbria, you can study for your undergraduate degree with QTS embedded, meaning you are fully qualified to teach when you graduate.
We offer teacher training options to suit every student.
If you're looking to train remotely, why not explore our part-time PGCE Online programme, which you can supplement with a QTS Direct Assessment to become fully qualified to teach.
At the University of Cumbria, we work with school-based partners, located in the North West and beyond.
This means that you can train remotely with one of our partners, whilst benefitting from the guidance of one of the UK's leading providers in teacher education.

MA in Outdoor and Experiential Learning
Living and working in Cumbria, the geographical location of Ambleside campus was perfect for me.
I had completed my undergraduate degree in Ambleside too and the reputation of the staff in the department was a definite draw.From my initial meeting with the programme leader once I had successfully been accepted onto to the MA course, I knew that I had made the right decision.
Flexibility of the programme
As the programme was module based, and as my workplace were so supportive in giving me leave to attend face to face modules, I agreed to choose some modules where I could use the expertise to develop my pedagogy and share research related practice with colleagues.
Due to a pre-organised teaching commitment I was not able to attend the first compulsory module and it was arranged that I would complete that module in year two of my studies.
I eventually spent three years studying part-time for the MA and the university were very flexible in this extension.
Whilst studying I also qualified as a Level 3 Forest School Practitioner and covered the assistant headteachers maternity leave for four days a week.Working whilst studying will always present with unplanned challenges but the open communication with the programme staff allowed for flexibility and understanding.
What I had not expected from the MA was the community that evolved; both from students and staff.
I felt so incredibly supported and although found the work challenging, the tutors were able to facilitate sessions which enabled me to critically reflect on a personal and professional level.
The expertise of the teaching staff was first class on the modules that I attended.
Deciding on next steps after my degree
After initially thinking the MA would be an opportunity for me to consider a career change, I have found it has broadened my educational view and encouraged me to look beyond my own setting at wider educational practice.
Since graduating I have become an assistant headteacher and also relished the opportunity to present at conferences discussing outdoor learning in primary schools.
The knowledge, skills and experience gained by completing the MA have been life changing.
I have grown in confidence; developed my own teaching and learning strategies; made new professional connections; widened my world lens and become excited and motivated in looking for new opportunities.
Undoubtedly the MA was hard work, in terms of course content and managing it alongside my life and a career.
Unquestionably I loved every minute of it and cannot recommend the course highly enough.
Undeniably it has had a positive impact on my career and continues to do so.

Class of 2021
Teaching was always something that I thought about going into, although it was more of a niggle in the back of my mind than the innate calling some people speak about.
I don’t think that makes me any less dedicated to the profession than anybody else, but I think I needed a few years after completing my undergraduate degree to reflect and evaluate what I wanted out of my career.
People had always told me that I would make a great teacher and when the opportunity presented itself, I decided to take the plunge and finally give it a go.
I haven’t looked back since.
After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked as a civil servant for two of DEFRA’s executive agencies.
My role was to complete complex case working and processing in order to support British farmers with their funding applications.
I was also a site processing mentor, helping other processors to complete their day-to-day tasks and providing support when necessary.
I enjoyed my time in the Civil Service but quickly understood that it wasn’t going to be my lifelong career.
There was little room to grow within the role, there wasn’t an opportunity to be creative and there was no autonomy either.
I wanted the ability to look back in 50 years and be proud of my career, its accomplishments and the difference I have made.
I wasn’t going to get that sat in a dull office, working 7hrs and 24 minutes a day!
I know now that I have made the right decision.
Working full-time and contemplating starting my PGCE was a little daunting, especially when I thought of how I would manage financially.
But I’ve made it work.
I decided that I wouldn’t work during my PGCE year as I wanted to focus solely on the course.
I knew that it was going to be a demanding year and I didn’t want to set myself up to struggle balancing the workload.
Reflecting back, I probably could have managed to work part-time as it hasn’t been as demanding as I imagined but I don’t regret my decision to focus on my degree.
I applied and received offers from University of Cumbria, Edge Hill University and a local teaching course.
Although when the time came to finalise my decision, University of Cumbria was the obvious choice.
Being from West Cumbria, the University was a commutable distance away from home, my stepfather is a Senior Lecturer at the University and I know many people have successfully completed their ITT (Initial Teacher Training) here.
I knew that the lecture sizes would be smaller than at Edge Hill and so I wouldn’t just be a number in a large crowd.
I also got the feeling that we would be able to create fantastic working relationships with the lecturers and I couldn’t have been more right.
I wanted the University experience again!
It is a familiar institution even though I didn’t do my undergraduate degree at University of Cumbria.
I liked the idea of having that proper instruction and taught provision, in a setting like the University.
I also wanted to complete an MEd, to further develop my pedagogical knowledge and I felt that I would benefit most by having my level 7 modules taught in a lecture hall.
I would say the lecturers are probably the best thing about the PGCE course.
They have an abundant wealth of knowledge as they have been teaching practitioners for several years.
My undergraduate degree isn’t anything to do with teaching, nor is it even something found on the National Curriculum and so I didn’t come to the course with very much teaching knowledge.
Their passion and enthusiasm for the profession and for training us ITT students is been pretty inspiring.
I hadn’t had any classroom experience before starting the course (thanks to the pandemic) but I quickly found my feet in the classroom.
I have surprisingly not really found anything on any placement which I wasn’t expecting already.
The first few weeks on the course really prepares you for your first placement.
So, I don’t think there was anything that I found to be a shock.
I’m wanting to complete the NQT (Newly Qualified Teacher) process in a school abroad.
I am waiting to hear back from a couple of schools that I have interviewed with and should find out if I have been successful in the next couple of days.
My local area is really small and so teaching jobs are few and far in between around here, but I could do with a few years of nice weather.
That is the beauty of a PGCE you can teach anywhere, including abroad.
I think the first thing I am looking forward to is having my own classroom.
I cannot wait until I can put things exactly how I want them rather than teaching in someone else’s room, where nothing is where I would put it myself.
On the back of that, I’m looking forward to my very first class that I can call my own.
Seeing them right through from September to July, every good day and bad one, seeing them experience and try new things and learning myself along the way.
One of the teachers at my placement school said to me “the second that you think you know everything there is to know about teaching, is the day you should leave and never return.
It’s no longer right for you”.
I couldn’t agree more.
You are learning every day and I am looking forward to becoming the best teacher I can be.
We've got you.

Research
Research integrity means conducting research in a manner that evidences the highest possible professional standards and quality.
This is applicable across the full research process, including planning and conducting, recording and report dissemination, and application.
The University is a signatory to the UKCORI Concordat to Support Research Integrity (refreshed April 2025) and is committed to its five core principles.
Research ethics represents one critical aspect of integrity, focusing on the principles of respect for persons, equality, informed consent, confidentiality, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
This page contains the University of Cumbria's policies, practices, and guidance on research integrity and ethics with a view to promoting best practices in the ethical conduct of research.
Our staff and students must maintain high professional standards through the conduct of their research.
The University has policies and procedures in place to ensure this, outlined in the University's UoC Code of Practice for Researchers .
This Code sets out the principles of good conduct in research to be adhered by and directly supports the University's commitment to the UK Committee on Research Integrity's Concordat to Support Research Integrity (refreshed April 2025).
The Head of Research & Knowledge Exchange is the confidential liaison for whistle-blowers or any other person wishing to raise concerns about the integrity of research being conducted at the University.
Allegations of misconduct in research must be provided in writing to Anish Kurien .
Research governance is provided through our Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee of which the Research Ethics Panel is a sub-group.
The University of Cumbria is a signatory to the UK Committee on Research Integrity's Concordat to Support Research Integrity (refreshed April 2025), a commitment by 136 UK universities to support and embed a culture of research integrity.
In line with the requirements of the Concordat to Support Research Integrity , the University’s Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee reviews and approves an annual statement summarising how research integrity is promoted and supported, including details of related activities undertaken across the University.
The University of Cumbria expects that all university researchers will uphold the highest possible standards of research integrity , as clarified in the UoC Code of Practice for Researchers .
This applies to all staff, postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and their supervisors, and all student researchers reading for taught degrees and their supervisors.
As a core element of this integrity, formal ethics approval is prospectively required for all research activities that directly involve humans, human tissue, data relating to humans, animals, data where intellectual property is unclear, matters that could impact upon the university’s reputation and others indicated below, and in the formal Research Ethics Policy .
It is the responsibility of a Principal Investigator (PI) or a PGR’s lead supervisor to determine whether ethics review of a project is required from the UoC Research Ethics Panel (REP).
It is the responsibility of Research Module Leaders on undergraduate and postgraduate taught degree programmes to provide an appropriate framework for ethically reviewing student projects, and the responsibility of a student’s research supervisor to determine whether ethical approval is required.
Conducting research at any level without necessary ethics approval will be considered research misconduct, which will be investigated in all cases.
Immediately below is some key information that might help UoC staff and PGRs understand and navigate the UoC ethics process for most types of research.
While teaching teams are responsible for the management of research ethics on taught programmes, much of this information might nevertheless prove useful in design and decision-making.
The purpose of ethics review is to help secure the safety and wellbeing of participants and researchers alike.
To these ends, the Research Ethics Panel (REP) is responsible for ensuring that proposed research submitted for consideration meets required ethical standards, and that feedback to applicants will help support and develop their understanding of good ethical research conduct.
The REP is primarily concerned with research undertaken by University staff, on any form of contract, and postgraduate research students.
The UoC REP recommends that four to six weeks is allowed for initial review.
This is to make certain that the reviewers, who evaluate ethics applications around their own workloads, have sufficient time to give all applications the attention they warrant.
The duration until to final approval, meanwhile, is contingent upon the quality of the submitted forms, the complexity of the proposed project, the range of amendments requested and so forth.
It is entirely the responsibility of the applicant(s) to submit all necessary materials to the REP in good time, so that any data collection can start as planned, and only after ethics approval has been obtained.
In cases where ethics approval for the research has already been secured via another HEI or similarly reputable body (e.g.
the NHS), a full UoC application is not necessary.
Rather, the PI should simply complete the following form to register the study with the UoC Research Office.
As per the Research Ethics Policy , ethics review is required for any research which involves any one or more of the features below:
NHS Research Ethics Committees (RECs) review research taking place in or through the NHS, and other health and social care research.
Projects potentially requiring NHS ethics review and clearance should firstly follow the most recent guidance provided by the Health Research Authority (HRA) , and ideally using the HRA’s decision tool .
Where NHS REC review is not deemed to be required for a project, then UoC REP review should be sought instead.
Ethics review is generally deemed unnecessary for projects that clearly do not involve any of the key features listed in the previous section.
These typically include:
Where it is unclear to the researcher(s) whether a proposed project requires ethical review, they should seek guidance from the Chair of the Research Ethics Panel via the Research Office .
Where it is determined that a project does not need ethical review, the PI should nevertheless complete the following form to register the project with the UoC Research Office.
To acquire ethical approval for research projects involving human participants or other live subjects, an application must be made to the Research Ethics Panel using the forms below.
This is then independently scrutinised by two panel members and a decision made by the Chair and issued to the applicant in writing.
The below application form for staff and postgraduate research students must be completed and submitted to research.office@cumbria.ac.uk .
Research Ethics Application Form Human - for Staff & Research students
Completion Notes - guidance for the completion of the research ethics application for Staff and Research students for studies involving human participants.

The university had given me a chance to prove myself, so I did just that.
(With my dissertation, right before I submitted it)
I don’t know what I expected the Law LLB (Hons) course to be like, but I do know that the more I studied, the more interested in law I became, and the lecturers were very supportive.
I worked hard, and I pushed myself to get the grades I needed to succeed.
During my studies, I was self-supported, working relentlessly outside of university to make ends meet and support myself.
If there’s anything I’d recommend, it’s getting involved in all the volunteering and extra work that you can, the university has great connections with local businesses and charities.
I volunteered at the local law centre for most of my studies and learned loads about justiciable issues in the local community and how the law works in practice.
I was also actively involved in digital marketing for the university where I developed lots of transferable skills that I was able to bring with me to my career now.
(At the Law Ball)
So, despite my earlier hang-ups about my academic ability, I will be leaving the University of Cumbria with a first-class degree, and as the winner of the Sweet & Maxwell Law Prize.
I will continue my studies, work part-time at the firm, and complete the LLM in Legal Practice so that I may train as a solicitor at this same firm – meaning all being well, that I will be a fully qualified solicitor within the next 3 years.
University has literally changed my life and I am overwhelmed by how much I have been able to progress in my career because I pushed for more and because of the support and reassurance I received along the way.
What I’m trying to say is, don’t doubt yourself, if you want something then you will get there, you just need to work for it.
(Now working as Legal Advisor at Butterworths Solicitors in Carlise)

Application Timeframes
Completed applications are considered by an Application Review Panel made up of the Programme Leader and other members of the assessment team.
The Panel will assess the evidence provided by your application against the DfE’s guidance for Assessment Only eligibility .
Application Review Panels are held as follows:
The Assessment Only route will enable you to demonstrate the professional understanding and skills necessary to meet QTS standards, evaluate your current practice, and support your continuing professional development.
Everything that you need to guide you through the assessment will be provided:  a detailed route handbook for both you and your school mentor, document templates and proformas, and access to our Virtual Learning Environment where you will complete your electronic portfolio.
Your school mentor will support the development of your e-portfolio and provide lesson observations during your assessed practice.
We will allocate to you a named university tutor who will provide advice and support throughout the whole process.
Your school mentor and university tutor will work in partnership to assess that your e-portfolio evidence and classroom practice fully meet the Teachers’ Standards.
The length of time from your initial assessment interview to the completion of your assessment is between 6 to 12 weeks.
On being accepted for an initial assessment, the assessment process then proceeds in four stages:
For a detailed summary please read our programme specification for this route.
Programme Specification
QTS Assessment Only fees are £2,800 in the academic year 2025/26, payable in the following instalments:
Please note, should candidates fail to provide sufficient evidence at the initial assessment stage to continue to the assessed practice stage, the £570 paid is non-refundable.
No additional costs are anticipated.
Before you apply you must have the following essential entry criteria:
Applicants must have the active support of a sponsoring school who can provide the following:
For further guidance on entry requirements please see the Department for Education guidance for the Assessment Only route to QTS.
Gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) while teaching in your current school via the Assessment Only route at the University of Cumbria.
Achieve QTS with the University of Cumbria within 12 weeks by demonstrating your teaching experience via interview, e-portfolio, and assessed practice.
This route is perfect for experienced unqualified teachers in maintained or independent schools who teach the English National Curriculum in primary or secondary age ranges.
The unique feature of this route is its ‘assessment only’ characteristic.
The University of Cumbria does not provide any training.
This route is designed for candidates who can demonstrate that they are able to fully meet all of the Teachers’ Standards without the need for further training.
The University of Cumbria has been inspiring teachers through training and professional development for over 100 years, beginning with our founding institutions, St Martin’s College in Lancaster and Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside.
Take advantage of our straightforward and supportive route to achieve QTS and help advance your career.
Potential candidates are strongly encouraged to attend one of our free online information sessions to gain further insight into the QTS Assessment Only route, meet members of the assessment team, and have the opportunity to answer questions.
In previous years, 100% of successful Assessment Only candidates stated that attending an information session really helped them with their application.
‘The online session provided extensive information which was honest and transparent about who the route was suitable for.
Queries I had after this were followed up quickly and in detail.’
(Candidate feedback, 2023)
Online information sessions for 25/26 assessments will take place as follows.
Please register your interest via these webforms.
A Teams link will be sent you a week before each session.
Wednesday 8th October 2025 4:00pm - 5:00pm Wednesday 14th January 2026 4:00pm - 5:00pm
Your assessment must consist of evidence that you have met all of the Teachers’ Standards in at least two age ranges.
The possible age categories for assessment are below, with the two age ranges identified here in each case:
Assessment Only entry criteria states that applicants must have experience of teaching in two settings.
Candidates will need at least 20 days’ teaching experience in a second setting before they are eligible for this route.
A 20 day whole class teaching experience would need to be arranged independently between schools in preparation for your assessment.
This teaching experience must involve substantial teaching (ie at least 50% of timetable), not learning support.
It may be undertaken as a block, or weekly over the term.
A timetable and reference are required from your second school to confirm that your teaching meets the Teachers’ Standards.
When making arrangements between schools, target any ‘gaps’ or limitations in your current teaching experience.
For example, related to boys/girls, age range, ability range, pupils’ backgrounds, class sizes, subject & pedagogy, GCSE/BTEC requirements, school approaches and organisation etc.
It depends on what teaching experience you have behind you.
As a general rule, you should be able to evidence experience of teaching around an 80% full-time timetable for a minimum of two years (or pro-rata equivalent).
However, we will consider each applicant’s unique situation in accordance with the DfE guidance on sufficient breadth and variety of experience.
Many applicants are from the independent sector, including Prep schools, or teachers who work in Special Schools, colleges or PRUs.
For all applicants in these settings consideration will be given to their teaching experience as a whole, across their two settings, to make sure that they have had the opportunity to fully demonstrate meeting all the standards across their full age and ability range.
Where necessary, additional evidence of teaching may be required to provide further evidence.
For example, related to boys/girls, class sizes, age ranges, full ability range, subject & pedagogy; GCSE/BTEC requirements, pupils’ backgrounds, school approaches and organisation etc.
We realise that this is the teaching context for some applicants, who work with smaller class sizes.
We will discuss each context individually to ensure that the eligibility requirements are met.
Where necessary, additional evidence of teaching may be arranged, eg teaching larger classes, to address the full expectations of the Teachers’ Standards.
Assessment Only is NOT A TRAINING ROUTE.
This route is for experienced unqualified teachers who already meet all requirements of the Teachers’ Standards.
No additional training is provided.
Please note, this means we also cannot accept evidence or experience gained as part of a teacher training route in your application or portfolio.
If your school has appointed you as an unqualified new teacher to teach your own timetable and it supports your professional development and journey to QTS, as long as you meet the other eligibility criteria, this route would become suitable for you in due course.
This route is not suitable for trainees and it is not compatible with an in-house teacher training route, eg, similar to other teacher training routes.
If you do not teach a full timetable, this should only be because of your other responsibilities in school, not because you are regarded as a trainee.
Other recognised teacher training routes are suitable for trainees, but Assessment Only is only suitable for experienced teachers.
We are not able to consider your application until you fully meet all essential criteria.
We would encourage you to discuss your ambition with your Headteacher/Principal and seek in-school support to gain the additional teaching experience you need.
TAs and HLTAs who have successfully gained QTS via the AO route have been able to evidence significant experience of whole-class teaching an 80% full-time timetable for a minimum of two years (or pro-rata equivalent).
Whole-class teaching involves planning, assessing and reporting, not only delivering already prepared lesson plans.
If you can evidence you fully meet the entry criteria without further training, we would welcome your application.
In secondary schools, assessments are made in relation to a named subject only.
You must be able to provide evidence of substantial experience of teaching your named subject in two age ranges and across the ability range, teaching an 80% full-time timetable for a minimum of two years (or pro-rata equivalent).
No, although usually applicants are already teaching in their own schools when they apply.
It is not a requirement that you are currently employed in teaching at the point of application, if 1) you have recent relevant experience, 2) your evidence meets all the Teachers’ Standards and 3) you have secured a sponsoring school which will support your application.
The sponsoring school must meet the requirements of the Partnership Agreement, as set out in the Partnership Agreement Handbook, provide a suitable teaching timetable and references which confirm that your teaching has been recently observed and meets the Teachers’ Standards.
The University of Cumbria is not able to help with identifying or providing sponsoring schools on the Assessment Only route.
You do not need to have a degree in a particular subject.
It is the Teachers’ Standards for QTS that specify the subject knowledge required for the award of QTS.
There is no statutory requirement for primary applicants to have a degree in a national curriculum subject, nor is there a requirement for secondary applicants to have a degree in a specified subject, as long as they meet all of the standards for QTS, including those that relate to subject and curriculum knowledge.
If your degree is third class it is still possible to demonstrate that you have the appropriate experience and are able to meet the Teachers’ Standards at the highest level.
All candidates will be required to complete a detailed Subject Knowledge audit as part of their assessment process.
This will relate to a specific subject for Secondary/Prep applicants and across the curriculum and/or EYFS for Primary applicants.

Class of 2012
Coming from London, Imran was used to big city life, but felt it was time for a change.
"I was attracted to the University of Cumbria because of the personal feel of the course, the campus and cohort was relatively small so you got to know everyone well.
I wanted to experience a different lifestyle to London and I very quickly fell in love with Carlisle."
Imran chose the course as "it was a course that offered 3 years of dedicated learning around Primary Education (as opposed to a 1 year PGCE) and offered a direct route into teaching.
The degree completely changed my life, teaching is a career that changes your life as it is such an important one where you are shaping the life of the children you teach and making decisions for the future of a school.
Plus I met my wife on the course!"
"Studying at the University of Cumbria shaped my life and my career and I enjoyed every moment of it!"
Imran is now a head teacher, working for Norfolk County Council.
"I love making a positive difference to lives of all the children I teach and being able to make decisions that lead to positive outcomes for the children’s wellbeing and learning.
"Prospective students should know the University of Cumbria supports its students whilst they are studying and far beyond graduation – the tutors really care about you.
My advice to current and prospective students considering a similar career should know that education is demanding and you have to put in a lot of hard work but it is a really rewarding career."

New sentences found on https://cumbria.ac.uk/student-life/student-stories/teaching--education-undergrad/kerry-burns.html:
Why did you choose a career change into teaching?
Initially, I worked as a journalist for the BBC.
I left school at 19 and I did an apprenticeship scheme, so I'd never been to university before.
I worked as a journalist for six years and then decided that it didn't really suit me anymore; it wasn't fulfilling me.
I wanted to do something that would allow me to actually make a real difference to people's lives, which led me to the idea of wanting to become a teacher.
Why do you want to be a teacher?
I want to be a teacher because I think it's a really amazing career where you can actually make a hands-on difference in people's lives.
Working with children is such an incredible opportunity, as you get to impact little lives and help them grow and develop on their path.
Seeing their progress throughout the year, and knowing that as a teacher, you have helped them to achieve that.
I think it's busy and difficult, but what a fulfilling career, and I can't think of anything better.
Why did you choose the University of Cumbria?
When I was considering what university to attend, it was really important to me to find the right balance between an excellent academical degree and the right environment to study.
The University  Cumbria offered an excellent academic degree, providing me with qualified teacher status that would enable me to launch straight into my career afterwards.
Additionally, it gave me access to the Lake District, Cumbria, and even Scotland.
It offered a really nice mix of university life with that rural twist that I was really excited about.
"The University of Cumbria offers a good blend of brilliant academics while also recognising that you need to have fun and be creative as a teacher.
I highly recommend studying teaching at the University of Cumbria for all these reasons."
What have you enjoyed the most about your studies, so far?
The best part of my studies was going on placement in local schools, where I could apply the theory I had learned in lectures and put it into practice in a real world classroom.
We do this degree because we want to work with children, so any opportunity to go into schools was always a highlight for me.
How have the tutors supported you during your studies?
The teaching staff at the university have been amazing.
I was really nervous when I started, particularly with academic writing, meeting university deadlines, referencing, and all these new challenges.
However, the staff were nothing but helpful.
They were always an email away and willing to give me time at the end of a lecture if I needed to ask a question.
Additionally, the wider university staff have also been really helpful.
The Library Skills at Cumbria, who assist in reviewing assignments before they are handed in, have just been absolutely amazing.
What's been the most difficult obstacle you've overcome in your student journey, so far?
I think the most difficult obstacle that I've had to overcome has definitely been balancing the workload whilst on placement.
It's a really busy course with a lot of academic tasks to keep up with, alongside the pressures of teaching in schools.
So, it was a big obstacle making sure that I was succeeding at both and not letting the ball drop with anything.
However, that's where the support and facilities at the university came into play.
I was able to get help from my lecturers, utilise the library, and receive advice when struggling with workload.
I feel better going into second year, and a lot more prepared to juggle those two workloads.
As a mature student, have you faced any challenges getting back into education?
It's been it's been a difficult learning curve in some ways, coming back into education as a mature student.
I haven’t written an extended essay since I was 18, and starting university at 25 meant getting back into the swing of studying, which was definitely something that I might have underestimated a little bit.
However, I had full support of all of my lecturers helping me get back up to speed and it's been something that I'm really pleased that I've done.
I've not at all looked back and thought that was a silly mistake.
The Union has really embraced and welcomed me here and I've loved getting to try something a little bit different and bring skills from an old career and see how they can benefit my new career.
What was the moment when everything fell into place for you?
Everything fell into place during my final placement.
It was a lengthy stint, and I was in an amazing primary school when a pupil came up to me and said, “Miss Burns, I really like it when you teach maths because you make it really simple”.
I make no pretence that maths is my favourite subject; it is actually probably the subject that I struggle with the most!
So, to have a pupil come up to me and say you've actually made that really easy for me to understand, was when it all clicked into place.
It was then I realised the things that I'm learning at university and making me a better teacher, and that genuinely is going to impact children, enabling them to progress with the lessons I've taught them.
Tell us about your experiences on placement
Placement has been an amazing experience; an incredible part of my time at the university.
I think this course is unique as you’ve got that balance of university lectures and actual hands-on school opportunities.
I definitely learnt more about teaching once I went into the classroom.
I loved every single second of it.
It was busy and stressful at times, but being in school really confirmed that this is what I want to do.
What advice would you give to others looking to get into teaching?
I think the advice that I would give to any of the students, either already studying at university or considering coming to the university, would be to give things a go, to say yes.
There were so many opportunities that I've had at the university that I've only experienced by pushing myself out of my comfort zone, by saying yes to things that I might not ordinarily during a placement.
I was offered to go to Newcastle for a couple of days with some of the students, and that that was something that kind of terrified me slightly.
I didn't know if I was ready for that level of responsibility, but I said yes, and it ended up being one of my absolute highlights of my first year.
To anybody coming here or already studying here, I'd definitely say ‘yes’ and push yourself a little bit out of your comfort zone.
Student life is really good in Carlisle.
I think it's a good mixture of the city, the nightlife, and lots of events.
Carlisle is a buzzing, bustling place, so there's always lots happening and lots of events that you can get involved with.
The university also offers a wide range of societies that you can get involved with.
You also have the amazingly unique aspect of being able to hop onto a bus and be halfway up a fell in an hour and half.
Having the Lake District on my doorstep has been really amazing, and I believe that's completely unique to this university.
How is the course preparing you for your future in teaching
The course is really preparing me for my future by allowing me to go into schools and apply what I've been learning in lectures, and actually see how that will play out in real classroom settings.
It's good to understand why I've been learning certain things in lectures that might not have made sense at the time, but once I'm in schools, seeing how it applies is invaluable.
I believe this course is definitely preparing me for a future teaching career.
What are you looking forward to the most with regards to the career in teaching?
The thing that I'm looking forward to the most in my teaching career will be the little victories.
These are moments of breakthroughs where a student who has been struggling with something for a while finally gets it, and you know that it's a result of your perseverance, hard work, and ability to think outside the box to help them.
When something clicks for them, it feels amazing and brings brilliant moments as a teacher.
While there are school trips and productions with big, showy moments, it's those quiet little victories that I believe I will love the most about being a teacher.
Tell us about the outdoor classroom; what is it used for, and what are the benefits of using it.
The outdoor classroom is a resource that we have here at the University of Cumbria, which allows students to practice what it would be like to teach children in a slightly unconventional setting.
We learn a lot here; teaching is not always best done at a desk with pen and paper.
Children actually learn a lot more through exploring, adventure, play, and making mistakes while learning how to fix them.
An outdoor classroom provides an amazing space where children are able to do just that.
At the university, we've had lectures in the outdoor classroom.
We spent our Freshers' week in the DEM building, which was hilarious and provided a great team-building opportunity for the rest of my students to get to know each other.
We've also held maths lessons out there, and I've had the opportunity to work alongside a local primary school in their early years, nursery, and reception classes, going out there with them to do some planting and learn about life cycles, looking at tadpoles and frogs.
It's just a really brilliant space where you can diversify your teaching and bring it to life by actually being outside, rather than being stuck in a classroom.
What advice would you give students who are comparing universities?
The advice I would give to anybody looking to pursue a teaching degree would be to carefully consider the universities.
Make sure that they offer a good mixture of placements and actual lectures, ensure that you will attain qualified teacher status at the end of the course, and verify that the academic program provides you with everything you need.
Additionally, make sure that the university fosters a mix of fun.
Teaching is not only a fun career but also an amazing one.

In the placements I have been a part of so far, they have both been very different form each other, but both have taught me a lot about teaching and also about myself.
My first placement was in a year 6 class, whose students were ready to move on to secondary school.
There were many times where I was left on my own to teach the class, but luckily I had a lot of support for my mentor, and it was felt that I could handle that situation.
There were times when I felt really overwhelmed, but I loved rising to the challenge.
Within each placement, you get to know the different personalities within the class.

At the University of Cumbria, we offer a range of CPD courses to boost your skills, open up career prospects, and improve your specialist knowledge.
Due to the structure of these courses fees are assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Find out everything you need to know about CPD fees and funding down below.
Your offer letter will indicate the total number of credits associated with your course and the fee rate for a standard module.
The cost of modules studied in subsequent years of study may be subject to increases.
The tuition fees for part-time courses are based on the equivalent full-time fee.
It may be invoiced either pro-rata or by module depending on the course.
This will be set out in your offer letter.
Most part-time students are invoiced by module in each semester.
Tuition fee loans may be available for students studying for their first higher education qualification which is at least 25% of the intensity of the equivalent full-time course.
To be eligible for funding you must be registered for a minimum of 25% of the course each academic year.
For example, if the programme is a total of 120 credits on a full-time basis, as the modules are all either 20 or 40 credit modules, this means you must study for a minimum of 40 credits during the year.
If you only study one 20 credit module, for example, you will be ineligible for any funding and will become personally liable for fees for the year.
Tuition fee loans are not means-tested and you can be apply for up to the maximum amount of your fees, which is up to £7,145.
Tuition fee loans are paid directly to the university so you don’t have to worry about arranging payment.

BA/BSc or an Initial Teacher Training course at an intensity of at least 25% in the academic year may be eligible to apply for the part time maintenance loan.

We offer a range of grants, scholarships, and bursaries to support low-income students.

About The Cumbria Bursary
The Cumbria Bursary is our targeted financial support package for 1st year ‘home’ undergraduate students studying a qualifying course who are commencing their studies in the 2025/26 academic year.
It is a non-repayable bursary designed to support students with a household income of less than £25,000.
The Cumbria Bursary is provided through a fixed number of allocated awards and uses a scored prioritisation process to impartially rank all eligible applicants (with household incomes of less than £25,000 per annum).
We award bursaries to those with the highest scores.
These awards are worth £1,000 per year of full-time study or £500 per year of part-time study, for a maximum of 5 years (part-time) for students entering onto full time or substantive part-time* undergraduate programmes.
A proportion of our Cumbria Bursaries will be allocated specifically to students who are aged 21 and over on the 1st September 2025, who also meet the eligibility criteria outlined below.
*Part-time students must be studying at least 50% of a full-time equivalent course and registered on a minimum three-year course.
How does it work?
You do not need to apply separately for the Cumbria Bursary; simply applying for your student funding through your funding body will enable us to assess your eligibility alongside the information you provide on your UCAS application form.
It is important that you apply for income - assessed student finance through your funding body (e.g.
Student Finance England) as early as possible.
In your application, both you and your sponsors must give consent to share financial information with your Higher Education Institution.
All bursaries are subject to specific eligibility criteria (please see below).
Where there are more eligible students than awards available, these will be allocated according to the prioritisation criteria (outlined below).
Eligibility criteria
Cumbria Bursaries will not be available to students who are:
Prioritisation criteria
Usually, there are more students who meet the criteria than there are awards available.
Bursaries will be allocated according to the following prioritisation criteria:
*You must be identified as a Care Leaver or Estranged from your family by the Student Loans Company.
How do I know if I’ve received a Cumbria Bursary?
Cumbria Bursaries for 2025/26 will be allocated to eligible students after 3rd October 2025.
Successful candidates are notified in writing during October and November.
Letters sent via the Student Loans Company are forwarded to the correspondence address given on your Student Finance application and accessible online via your student finance account.
If I am unsuccessful, can I appeal?
There are a limited number of Cumbria Bursary awards available, allocated at the beginning of the first year of an eligible three or four year degree course.
Often students meet the criteria for the Cumbria Bursary award but do not receive an award as there are usually more eligible students than awards available.
New students are scored against the prioritisation criteria to determine who receives an award.
To maximise the beneficial impact of awards, and to maintain consistency, each student will be scored once only.
Bursaries are only awarded to students in Level 3 or Level 4 of their course, though the bursary is paid in each year of study.
The decision on granting Cumbria Bursary Awards made by the panel is final.
If you believe that the process of scoring you for a Cumbria Bursary may have been adversely effected by errors or omissions – for example if the Student Loans Company or the University did not have complete information about the relevant factors in your case – please contact us using the link below, for a review of the scoring process.
We aim to respond to a request for review within 10 working days of receipt.
The Student Support Fund is also available to students who experience financial difficulties or unexpected financial emergencies whilst attending their course.

The University is open and transparent about where its money comes from and how it is spent.
Our financial year runs from the 1st August to the 31st July and each year, we publish full audited accounts, showing how much income was received, where it came from and what it was used for.
You can access the published accounts here .
The University’s total income for 2023/24 was £78.3m , increased from £73.6m in 2022/23.
The majority of this (73%) came from our students, their employers or sponsors, as payments for tuition fees.
A further 13% came from Government agencies that distribute public money to universities, including from the Office for Students and Research England.
These grants have a range of purposes including providing supplementary funding for resource-intensive courses, such as those within healthcare and science areas, supporting the University’s efforts to widen participation in higher education and helping to fund research projects.
Overall we spent £78.2m in 2023/24, an increase of £4.3m from the previous year.
Excluding accounting adjustments relating to staff pension schemes, the value of the University’s land and buildings and release of capital grant funding, we generated a cash surplus of £3m, which is invested in buildings, equipment, IT, infrastructures and facilities.
For every £100 received we spent £48 on the provision and direct support of teaching and research activities.
This equated to £35.6m on the direct costs of teaching, learning and research, with a further £2.2m spent on providing support to deliver these services including, for example, quality assurance and academic compliance processes.

This section explains what you need to do to ensure that your sponsorship or funding is showing on your tuition fees account.
If you have funding through Student Finance your funding details should automatically be relayed to the university electronically, providing your funding application has been approved showing University of Cumbria on your funding approval letter from them.
If this is the case, you do not need to provide the information below to the university separately.
The university will only define a student as sponsored if the tuition fees are being paid by a funding organisation on their behalf and the funding organisation will pay the tuition fee balance directly to the university.
Students whose tuition fees are being paid by their parents or guardians are classed as self-funded.
Students must provide this proof of sponsorship each year they are being sponsored.
Letter of sponsorship
The income and fees team requires a letter of sponsorship from a funding organisation as proof of sponsorship before any funding is applied to a student’s record.
This letter must be on official letter headed paper and a copy emailed to sponsorletters@cumbria.ac.uk quoting the student number in the email.
Please note that an email itself is insufficient - we require a scanned copy of the official documentation.
It is advisable to send this as soon as possible in advance of the course start date so it can be applied to the student’s account prior to billing.
The letter must include the following:
Students will be classed as self-funded until the income and fees team receives your sponsor letter.
Sponsor letters from previous academic years will not be accepted unless they cover the full duration of the course.
The university reserves the right not to accept sponsorship letters that do not fulfil the above criteria.
NHS Sponsorship
The university has received notification from some NHS Trusts that invoices must quote a purchase order number.
if you are submitting a sponsor letter from the NHS it must quote a valid purchase order number.
If no purchase order number is quoted on the sponsor letter, then it must be state within the document that a purchase order number is not required by their NHS Trust.
Payment of sponsorship
Upon submission of a valid sponsor letter, sponsorship will be applied to the student record and the income and fees team will invoice the sponsor for payment shortly after the start of the course.
It is important that you make your sponsor aware of this prior to supplying your sponsor letter to the university.
Should a sponsor default on the payment of tuition fees then the responsibility for payment of the fees will revert to the student.
You can arrange to pay us in up to 3 instalments but the invoice must be paid by the end of the academic year or before you receive your next invoice for the same service.
Instalment options are only available to UK tuition fees over £1000.
The following teams are here to help you:
Contact accountsreceivableteam@cumbria.ac.uk if you have a query about how to pay an invoice or make a pre-payment.

For over 40 years, the School was based at Newton Rigg near Penrith, until the historic move to its new site at Ambleside in 2014.
The School is now part of the University of Cumbria and retains its distinctive identity whilst being able to draw on a wider range of expertise and skills within this larger organisation.

Living in Ambleside allowed me to find myself through every outdoor sport possible, and I quickly realised I couldn’t have gone anywhere else.
Geography was always the one subject I had a passion for at school, and I wasn’t sure what career path to follow at all.

I was given the opportunity to mix human, cultural, physical, and environmental geographies, as well as taking more outdoor focused modules.
I love the fact that through the whole degree I’ve been out in the field nearly every week, and trips to Scotland and Southern France in second and third year provided me with  the practical aspect of learning I like, and field skills I know will be helpful.
The small class sizes are similar to those I had at school, so I felt I could truly have a voice and interact.

So make the most of the fact they’re there for you.
Also, make sure not to shy away from talking to everyone you can from the get-go.
After three years I definitely know everyone in my year group, and at graduation the sense of community and celebration of everyone from Ambleside campus was really special.
Now I’ve finished I’m staying up in Ambleside, it’s too nice to leave just yet!
I’ve realised there’s no need to go straight into a job that uses my degree, so working in an outdoor shop part time is enough for now!
I’ve got plans for going on to a master’s degree at some point, but the lecturers are now helping me move towards publishing some research from my dissertation.

Settling in
Prospects
Going to university comes with many new expenses and understandably the cost can be a major concern.
Parents and carers are often most worried about finances, particularly concerning perceived debt.
However, we like to think of it more as a future ‘tax’ that the graduate will pay, rather than a debt.
It’s important to remember that any young person who normally lives (i.e is permanently resident) in the UK can apply to Student Finance for a variety of grants and loans to support them at university.
The government and the university also offer bursaries (non-repayable grants) for certain subjects, so there could be extra help available.
Explore our FAQs below or visit our Student Finance Hub for a full course fees breakdown.
Students can apply for both Tuition Fee support and Maintenance Loans through Student Finance .
These assist with covering the cost of the course and the Maintenance Loan can help with other university associated expenses.
Everybody is entitled to the Tuition Fee Loan for their first full-time undergraduate degree, and the loan meets the full cost of the tuition fees of their course so there is no requirement to pay any money upfront.
The amount of tuition fee loan they can apply for does not depend on their household income.
Students are able to apply before they confirm their place with their chosen university or college.
Tuition fees can vary based on whether the course is full or part-time, and award level (for example, full-time undergraduate courses have different fees to part-time postgraduate courses).
Tuition fees in subsequent years may be subject to small increases in line with inflation.
For the current tuition fees, please see details here:
Undergraduate Fees
Postgraduate Fees
Teacher Training PGCE Fees
Health Course Fees (Undergraduate and Postgraduate)
The Maintenance Loan is there to support with living costs associated with going to university.
This could cover rent, travel, food, bills, social activities or course resources.
The loan is subject to you giving your household income details and the money is paid directly into the student’s bank account at the start of each term.
Household income includes any of the following;
By visiting www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator you can approximate how much maintenance loan your child may be eligible for.
Interest starts being added to the loan from when your child receives their first payment.
Whilst they are studying, interest is 5.6%.
This is made up of the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%.
RPI is currently set at 2.6%.
This rate applies until the 5 April after they finish or leave their course, or for the first 4 years of their course if they are studying part-time, unless the RPI changes.
After that, their interest rate depends on their income in the current tax year.

A: There is also support available for students studying Medical, Pre-Registration Healthcare, Social Work and Teacher Training:

Updates can be made by contacting Student Finance if they change their mind on their course or institution.
If the applicant is from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland there are different processes in place, links are below for the Student Finance support and applications.

With the right research and support you could be in your new role in no time, without too much disruption to life as you know it.
At University of Cumbria we have a lot of experience with people coming to us to change their career, so we completely understand the concerns you may be having.
We’ve gathered some of our own advice about making a career change alongside hints and tips from some our current students and alumni.
Teacher, Psychologist, Lawyer, Nurse.
You may already know where your passion lies but there are usually more choices to be made.
So, you love the thought of being a Psychologist, but what kind of Psychologist?
Clinical?
Forensic?
Counselling?
The point here is, make sure you do the research behind your career change.
Use university open days to get a feel for courses and subjects.
You can even just use it as a chance to speak to experts who have worked into the industry and can guide you onto the right path for you.
If you’re anything like most of our mature students then you’ll have a clear career goal in mind.
When you’re choosing where to study for your change of career, make sure that they’re as passionate about you reaching that goal as you are.
You may choose a place of study because it offers the course you want to do or because it’s close to home and though they are very valid reasons, make sure that the course structure and lecturers will compliment you.
Here are some of the questions that we recommend you arm yourself with.
There are a number of concerns that our mature students experience before they begin their studies.
We’ve gathered some of those that seem to pop up, again and again, to try and guide you through your change of career.
Entry Qualifications:
One of the most common concerns we hear from our students looking for a career change is around their level of qualifications or having been away from study for so long.
Don’t be concerned though, if you don’t have the relevant qualifications there’s likely to be an access course in place to bring you up to the required level.
If you’re simply concerned about your skill level, such as writing, all of those concerns should fall away once you begin your studies.
If they don’t disappear quickly then there’s usually plenty of support in place to help you develop your skills.
Check before you enrol what support functions are in place such as one-to-one tutoring.
The Matter of the Mortgage:
This may be the most worrying element for most people.
There’s a great deal of support out there for students, including those looking to change their career.
Student finance is run by the Government and allows you to apply for Tuition Fee Loans and Maintenance Loans.
The amount you get depends on your personal circumstances and the type of course that you’re taking.
You may also get extra help if you have children.
In addition to the above, we have gathered some advice from some of our mature students that may help you achieve your career change goals.
Family First:
Whilst studying for your career change you will have to spend time on campus away from home.
You’ll also need somewhere to lock yourself away for studying at home, away from the distractions of modern family life (screaming children and Netflix).
What you really need to remember is that it’s not for long.
You have to outweigh the disadvantages with the benefits.
If you do have children, it just means that time spent with them will be that little bit more special because you’ll relish every moment, as well as knowing that you’re making a career change for them, as well as yourself.
There’s often support out there for mature students with young children.
For example at University of Cumbria we have a nursery on site for our students with childcare needs, other universities may offer the same, so we’d recommend checking if that option is there before you make any decisions.
Being That ‘Mature’ Student:
One of the most common concerns we hear about is being the ‘old one’.
You’ll probably be surprised by the amount of mature students at universities.
Many people only figure out what they want to do with their lives after they’ve spent several years doing the ‘wrong thing’.
A large amount of our students who are returning to study for a career change say that these concerns just disappear on your first day.
Even if you are the oldest in the room, you’re there with like-minded people with the same goals, you won’t even notice the age difference.
If anything you’ll end up with a group of friends with varying ages.
So, you’re almost decided but there are one or two niggles.
We strongly recommend reaching out to somebody who’s been there and done it.
Be it someone you know personally or a friend of a friend.
If you don’t know anybody who’s changed their career then there are platforms to discuss this with real people who you don’t know.
University of Cumbria have Access Platform which has a number of existing students there to chat to, including mature students who are more than happy to chat through any concerns with you.
Our final step is simple… Go on take the plunge and change your career.

Year two is designed to support your development of knowledge and skills that were delivered in year one.
Within this year of study, you will examine principles of pharmacology and medicine management, care of people with long term conditions and chronic health care needs, primary and community care and gain experience of caring for people in their own homes along with assessing and managing the acutely ill person and emergency care.

BSc (Hons) Sport Rehabilitation
I hadn’t been in education since leaving college at 19 with a HND in Sports Science (Almost 15 years ago!).
During this time, I had been raising a family and working in Internet Marketing.
My partner at the time was enrolled in University and encouraged me to look into the possibility of doing something I would enjoy, as I was actively looking for a career change but had not considered University.
I decided to apply to the University of Cumbria from advice given by friends and family who had attended the University and with it being in such a close proximity to my home it allowed me to combine my academic life with my home life.
I choose a BSc Sports Rehabilitation IFY due to my interest in both sports and injuries but having not been in education for a long time, I opted for the integrated foundation degree in the hope to have a platform to build on and prepare me for university life.
I would probably say the most difficult thing to overcome has been the belief in myself that I could achieve a degree.
I had never considered myself to be very academic whilst at school and college and returning to education hadn’t been something that had crossed my mind.
It wasn’t until it was recommended to me that I began to seriously think university was a possibility.
Once I started the degree, I began to enjoy all the aspects involved from lectures to practical sessions and utilising feedback from assessments.
It allowed me to progress and make adjustments to the areas of my development that needed improvement.
After my foundation year and when I entered year 1 of the Sport Rehabilitation degree programme.
Constant feedback from assessments was extremely useful in highlighting what was good and where improvement could be made.
This gave me an insight for each assessment to try and focus on areas requiring improvement.
The support from lecturers was second to none, they were always helpful and made time to answer any questions and help point me in the right direction.
For anyone thinking of coming to the University of Cumbria, I couldn’t recommend the university any more highly.
Try and use the foundation year as a base to build on, I guess that’s why it's called a foundation year!
It gives you all the skills that will be required such as referencing, introduction to journals and writing skills.
So definitely try to gain all you can from it, as when you progress and these elements are taught, it's more of a refresher to make sure you do them the right way.
I would also say if you’ve been out of education for a long period of time then consider a foundation to get you back into the routine of education.
The most enjoyable part of university has been the blend of learning through both practical and theoretical elements.
Being able to practice hands-on the things discussed during lectures makes it easier to learn, comprehend and develop skills.
Additionally, I liked the dynamic of being part of a group who were all striving for the same end goal.
There were so many different characters, backgrounds and experience but it felt like everyone was there for each other and this definitely played a big role in progressing through the degree.
The support provided by the staff was outstanding and the campus is easy to navigate to find where you should be and well equipped with everything required for the degree.
I finished my degree and graduated with a First Class.
I was also awarded The Institute of Health’s Most Inspiring Student.
This was a far cry from anything I could have imagined and not something I ever thought achievable upon leaving school.
Studying has converted me to have a different way of thinking and I have embraced education.
So much so that I have continued my studies with the university, and I am now undertaking a master’s degree in Physiotherapy.

Class of 2020
Teaching has always been a career I have wanted to get into for a very long time.
The time for me to start the training was right and so I decided to apply for the PGCE course without telling anyone.
I have always wanted to work with young children and after having been turned down for a number of teaching assistant positions over the years I thought I would grab the bull by the horns and go for my PGCE, and I am really glad I have.
It is the best thing I have done, it has been hard and challenging but really worthwhile and hopefully, I will be able to get a job straight away and start my teaching career this September.
I had worked in a variety of sectors since finishing university in 2007, all of which have been invaluable and have added to my life experience.
I worked as an assistant manager for Clarks shoes, was a manager of a small independent shoe shop in Lancaster, worked as an administrative assistant at a Family Court and as an administrative assistant at a letting's agency.
My last position was in a SEMH school in Blackburn as a teaching assistant, which was for children aged between 8-16 years old and it really opened my eyes.
To be honest, I was glad I was offered the job because it made me realise that being a teaching assistant was not the role for me but being a teacher was, and this is what inspired me to apply for my PGCE.
I gave up full-time work to do this course, but it was well worth it.
I have two children, a boy aged 9 and a girl aged 7.
I'm not going to lie, it wasn't easy having children and doing a full-time course.
On the plus side though, they come in useful for ideas and as guinea pigs to test out my lesson ideas on.
The decision to start on my PGCE journey was one which we discussed as a family and the children knew that I was going to be very busy and not able to pick them up after school or go to school assemblies like I used to be able to do.
We all had to make sacrifices as a family, but luckily for me, I have a husband who was able and willing to provide for us and who is very supportive of me.
Without him as a soundboard and support I’m not sure where I would be now (probably a nervous wreck in the corner).
My parents are also very supportive and look after the children when they finish school whilst I am at university and my husband is working.
I am very lucky to have the love and support of my family.
I completed my first degree at the former St Martin's College in Lancaster, which is now the University of Cumbria's Lancaster campus.
I knew that the campus was close enough to home for me to travel to every day and that the staff are very supportive and cohort sizes are not huge, therefore tutors can get to know their students on a personal level.
I love how passionate they are and how you are encouraged to try different ways of learning and to be creative not only inside the classroom, but also outside.
Their knowledge and experience really does show when they teach you and that's why I chose Cumbria.
"I have always wanted to work with young children and after having been turned down for a number of teaching assistant positions over the years I thought I would grab the bull by the horns and go for my PGCE, and I am really glad I have."
I have to be honest; it has taken me a while to get back into education and to enjoy what I am doing.
But once I was on placement and stood in front of a class who were responding to the lesson I had planned, that was what I loved the most.
That is what made me realise I made the right choice in deciding to study for a PGCE.
Don’t try to read everything at once otherwise, you will overwhelm yourself.
You are only human, read what you can, when you can.
Take every day as it comes, you can’t do everything, and you won’t know everything just because you are the teacher.
Deal with one thing at a time.
You think you have enough stationary but trust me, you don’t.
Try not to panic about placements, you will ease into it and get to know the staff and children.
Don’t look too far ahead, take one little step at a time.
Be prepared to feel very overwhelmed, especially at the start.
There might be a few tough moments but think of that end goal and YOU WILL SUCCEED!
To have a job in the pipeline and be ready to have a class of my own so I can start my teaching career as soon as possible.
I’m really looking forward to having a class of my own, but this is also scary because you are in charge of 30+ little people who rely on you to teach them and give them the knowledge they need to succeed.
Having said that, this career has been a long time coming for me and I can't wait to start.

Class of 2016
BA (Hons) Graphic Design Course
We caught up with our 2016 graduate Vincent Walden to find out where his career has taken him and how his degree has contributed to him getting there and Vincent had some exciting news to share!
After working for agencies and in-house for different businesses, he is now the proud owner of Studio Walden, an eco-friendly and sustainable Graphic Design studio in Cumbria.
Want to become a Graphic Designer?
Check out our BA (Hons) Graphic Design.
I chose my course because of three main things; the studio, the tutors and the environment.
I loved that I would walk through a park, under trees and past wildlife on my commute each morning—something that I came to really cherish throughout my time studying in Carlisle.
I have always studied art and, quite luckily for myself, knew from roughly 14 years old, that I wanted to follow Graphic Design .
It was a mixture of factors that made me realise that my passion was in following design.
Funnily enough, the largest factor was a Graphic Design module at my high school that I did rubbish in and quite frankly disliked - I knew there must be more to the industry than what I had been shown and through further research and consulting with my cousin who is an animator, I proved my hypothesis and quickly discovered a true north in my career trajectory.
To the best of my knowledge, nobody ever tried to dissuade me from following a creative career.
In fact, I had a lot of encouragement from my fantastic art teachers in sixth form alongside extended family members who were already professional creatives and shared resources and tips with me.
I chose the University of Cumbria because of the Brampton Road campus .
Having a campus full of creative people, with resources for all projects and situated next to a public park was essentially my dream university experience.
I choose the University of Cumbria because of the Brampton Road campus...
I thought it was an absolutely brilliant place to learn.
What I loved the most about my course was the setting and the tutors.
The things I loved most about my course was its setting and tutors.
I found their methods for teaching entertaining, informative and eﬀective – I’m still friendly with many today.
The course had a studio for just the course participants which created an amphitheatre of sharing and learning, allowing me to feel conﬁdent to share ideas and conversations with older and younger students alike.
After graduating I have gone through a number of roles from in-house design to agency work and now eventually working from myself under the banner Studio Walden , an eco-friendly design studio.
Throughout all the industries I have worked in (publishing, education and large-scale print) the course gave me the conﬁdence to tackle everything head-on and accept that sometimes I was going to have to go back to the drawing board as part of the process.

BSc (Hons) Mental Health Nursing

She is a true inspiration to us all, an amazing tutor (and nurse) and the cheerleader of all her students."
"I have been given lots of opportunities to develop as a person and have encouraged all the way to pursue the jobs I really really want."
Catherine didn't just focus on her studies though.
"I have been involved in a lot of extracurricular work and being able to do this as a student has been great.
I have made a real difference to the nursing world and beyond and this is something I never thought possible when I started my degree."
What would Catherine advise to those considering studying at the University of Cumbria?
"Go for it!
If you want good quality teaching and want to be a person, not a number, in a classroom, this is the place to come.
And for anyone who is nervous about going away from home for the first time or is worried about coping with university life, this is the place for you.
You will be so supported you will settle straight in."

My name is Nicole and I am 20 years old.
I moved to Carlisle, Cumbria, from South Africa in April 2019 and started a Fine Arts degree at the University of Cumbria in September 2019.
I have now lived here for a year, and here I will share with you what I have learnt so far through my experiences.
The UK is known for having excellent universities.
If you decide to get your education in the UK, your degree will be recognised and respected, no matter where in the world you end up being employed after graduating.
Completing your degree in the UK may also take less time than it would in your home country.
Whereas most other countries take at least four years for an undergraduate degree and two or three years for a postgraduate degree , it usually takes three years for an undergraduate degree, and one year for a postgraduate in the UK.
This was the case with my degree, which means that I will now be able to graduate a whole year before I would have graduated in South Africa.
Of all the choices of universities within the UK that offer Bachelor’s degrees in Fine Art, I chose the University of Cumbria because of its amazing location and beautiful surroundings.
The high quality of teaching and the way in which the staff care for each individual student is something that has made me feel completely at home and safe, and which you would be hard to match anywhere else in the world.
Most universities offer scholarships, grants, and bursaries, some of which are exclusive to international students.
I was fortunate enough to be awarded an international scholarship for my first year at the University of Cumbria.
Information on the scholarships and bursaries offered by the university is available at: https://www.cumbria.ac.uk/study/student-finance/scholarships-and-bursaries/ .
Every year, over 400,000 international students decide to study in the UK, which means that you’ll get to meet and become friends with people from all over the world.
Britain has a rich, interesting history, and Cumbria is no exception.
You can visit historical and cultural sites such as Hadrian’s Wall, Roman Forts, ancient stone circles, and countless abbeys, priories, cathedrals, and castles.
The UK is a great place to base yourself if you are wanting to travel within the rest of Europe.
From my base in Carlisle in the North West of England, I can reach Edinburgh or Glasgow in Scotland in around 90 minutes.
Travel to Wales or Northern Ireland is also relatively easy and allows me to experience the different cultures and lifestyles of each country that makes up the United Kingdom.
Public transportation is easy to use and cost-effective, making it simple to travel the entire country and take in the sights and sounds.
As a student, you can receive special rates for transportation and entrance to most places of interest.
The English Channel Tunnel can take you right into the middle of Europe within a day.
Depending on your nationality, you may need to acquire another visa (a “Schengen” visa) to travel to countries outside of the UK, so make sure to do your research beforehand.
The University of Cumbria regularly organises day trips for students to interesting locations around Cumbria and nearby places of interest, as well as longer, international excursions.
I went on a university-organised trip to Berlin, Germany a couple of months ago.
It was amazing to be able to experience a new city and its culture with my friends.
The university is located in one of the UK’s top tourist destinations.
It is near the beautiful English Lake District with some of the most spectacular countryside to be found in the UK or even Europe.
All of the University of Cumbria campuses are compact and self-contained and everybody is very friendly and welcoming.
I study at the Brampton Road campus, which has a very supportive, vibrant, and creative environment; it is easy to feel at home here.
The class sizes are fairly small, which makes for a more personal experience.
The university’s student support is exceptional - help is always right there, whenever you need it.
As international students, we are guaranteed to be allocated a room in accommodation on campus for the first year as long as you apply by the deadline.
Living on campus is very convenient and it helps you to meet new people and make friends as soon as you arrive.
The cost of living here is also very low, which is a big help when it comes to stretching your student budget!
Overall, I have had an amazing first year living and studying in the UK at the University of Cumbria and I would not want to be anywhere else!

Education
View Courses
I have now been at University of Cumbria and before that, St Martin’s College, one of its legacy institutions since 2003.
I work in Initial Teacher Education, heading up the university’s primary postgraduate programmes across all campuses including school direct.
My specialist area is English, so I teach a lot of that as well as general teaching skills like behaviour management, lesson planning and assessment.
I also teach on the masters’ level modules for the PGCE and supervise PhDs.
Prior to this I was a primary school teacher and senior leader in a small school in west Lancashire and then a much larger Lancaster city centre school.
Whilst there I was a mentor for students and newly qualified teachers and I was invited by our school’s partnership tutor to apply for a role at S.
Martin’s College, where I had qualified from with my degree and Qualified Teacher Status seven years earlier.
So, as I mentioned before I worked in two contrasting primary schools prior to coming into higher education.
I taught mainly ages 7-11 (Years 3-6).
This gave a me a lot of experience of teaching, developing my skills, maturing as a person and teacher and I had a fantastic time, taught some great young people (some who I still see and some who have since done their teacher training with me!!!).
I have also worked with some great colleagues and had some fantastic experiences in the classroom, on school trips, residentials, leading sports clubs, choirs and a samba band.
Transitioning into academia was quite a challenge.
Moving from filling a one-hour lesson with 9-year-olds to two-hour seminars with 24-year-olds was a huge challenge.
Thankfully I had lots of support from a brilliant team, a hugely supportive line manager and some gracious students.
I also found completing the Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education really helpful in understanding some of the key differences in teaching approaches with students.
As someone who didn’t do brilliantly at school, I have never really considered myself academic, so achieving a PhD in 2021 was probably a huge highlight and achievement for me.
I have also published a couple of books – available on Amazon, or in the library – ‘Being Creative in Primary English’ published in 2016 and ‘Thinking for primary Writing’ (based on my PhD research) published earlier in 2024.
I used to be a Pig Farmer!!
I teach a wide variety of modules, so it is very hard to choose which ones to highlight here.
One of my favourites to teach is for our primary PGCE students which focuses them on elements of high-quality learning and teaching, such as outdoor learning, creative thinking, mindset theory.
The students then prepare an intervention in school on one of these elements and evaluate its success.
I really enjoy the work the students do on this module, they really grapple with some of the grey areas of their chosen aspect and learn loads.
There is also an opportunity for me to get into ‘creative thinking mode’ and have some fun with the teaching and learning.
The team that I lead and work with are fantastic.
We have a great bunch of tutors who care about students, care about learning and are huge advocates for teachers and teaching.
I really enjoy the small campuses – you know everyone, great relationships are developed in these environments and I think that is a huge strength of University of Cumbria.
I also love the students we attract – a real mix of characters and experience which adds to the richness of the learning.
We also have a gorgeous landscape around us!
The primary PGCE offers a unique and innovative pathway called ‘Environmental and Experiential Learning’ which looks at place-based learning, unique to Morecambe through Eden Project North.
It provides students with an exciting opportunity to get involved in curriculum shaping, explore key up to date concepts such as sustainability and climate change and make a difference to the learning experiences of many learners in the region.
We also structure our programme intentionally around three school placements whereas most providers offer two.
This means you get a wider variety of school experience and a range of year groups which is helpful when applying for jobs.
Three placements also means more opportunity to come back to university in between to evaluate learning, share experiences and learn from the tutors and other students before going back out into school.
One of the key pieces of advice I would give to those wanting to go into teaching, is get some experience of being in a school and working with children in this setting if you can.
Schools are interesting places and haver their own sets of dynamics which are important to navigate.
Those students who understand that and can bring good interpersonal skills to the programme do tend to do very well on the course.
You also have to make sure you are fascinated by how children learn and actually enjoy being with children.
It makes a real difference to the job and to the lives and experiences of those you will teach.
I would also say, don’t always listen to the negative ways in which social media and popular press often paint teachers and teaching.
I have the privilege to work with many wonderful schools, some brilliant and innovative teachers and some superb children.
There is some great work going on in our primary schools that you can be a part of.
There are other avenues that the PGCE with Qualified Teacher Status can open up for you.
You may wish to pursue something like museums education, play therapy, educational psychology and many other opportunities to put your transferable skills to very good use.

Business
Since 2016, I've been teaching at the University of Cumbria.
My journey into academia began with a desire to improve working conditions and create happier, more positive workplaces for both individuals and organisations.
This passion led me to pursue a career in academia and focus my PhD studies on Human Resource Management (HRM), particularly on career development.
Throughout my academic journey, I've been dedicated to understanding HRM and its connection to people's careers.
I aim to help organisations support their employees in achieving their goals and finding happiness in their work.
Teaching at the university allows me to share knowledge, insights, and engage in meaningful discussions with students, helping them grow and develop.
It's a privilege to inspire and empower future professionals to positively impact the working world.
Overall, my academic journey has been fuelled by a passion for improving working conditions and fostering happier, more fulfilling work environments for individuals and organisations.
I have a diverse background in the public sector, primarily within Human Resources, where I've held various roles.
My experience in the public sector provided me with valuable insights into organisational dynamics and the challenges faced by employees.
The transition to academia occurred when I recognised the potential to leverage my expertise to help individuals find sustainable and happier careers through research.
My desire to make a broader impact led me to pursue opportunities in academia, where I could delve into the issues surrounding career development and  career sustainability and contribute to solutions through research and education.
This transition allowed me to combine my practical experience with academic pursuits, enabling me to empower others to navigate their career paths effectively and sustainably.
In my journey through academia, I've had the privilege of collaborating on several research projects, each exploring important aspects of human experience and organisational dynamics.
Together with various colleagues, we explored how individuals navigate and empower themselves during challenging times, such as the unprecedented circumstances brought about by a pandemic.
We also sought  to understand how to foster both a strong entrepreneurial spirit and overall well-being among university students, regardless of cultural background.
One of our endeavours led us to examine the relationship between Human Resource Management practices and intelligent career development within the public sector.
Additionally, I have been involved in examining the impact of industrial placement years on students' skill development over time.
Aiming to shed light on how these experiences shape the competencies and capabilities of future professionals.
In parallel, we investigated the multifaceted factors influencing student well-being within the higher education setting.
Our aim was to understand the challenges students face and identify strategies to support their holistic development and overall happiness.
These research endeavours, along with numerous opportunities to present our findings at conferences and contribute book chapters to academic publications, underscore my commitment to understanding the intricate interplay between career development, well-being, and organisational dynamics.
As prospective students, you can expect to join me in this journey of exploration and discovery, engaging in research that not only addresses pressing societal issues but also contributes to positive change in both academic and professional spheres.
I primarily teach modules related to Human Resource Management (HRM) and Organisational Behaviour (OB).
One of my favourite aspects of these modules is engaging in discussions with students and exchanging ideas.
I find that these interactions not only enrich the learning experience but also foster a collaborative environment where everyone's perspectives are valued.
It's incredibly rewarding to see students actively participate in class discussions, sharing their insights and challenging each other's viewpoints.
This dynamic exchange of ideas not only enhances understanding but also promotes critical thinking and deeper engagement with the course material.
What sets our course apart is our commitment to fostering independent learners and cultivating vibrant debate within the classroom.
Beyond traditional lectures, we offer a range of extracurricular activities designed to enrich students' educational experience.
One key aspect is our strong links with local businesses.
We actively collaborate with these organisations to provide students with real-world insights and opportunities for practical learning.
Through guest lectures, students gain valuable perspectives from professionals in the field, helping them to bridge theory with practice and develop essential skills for their future careers.
Moreover, our emphasis on debate and discussion creates a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to voice their opinions, challenge conventional thinking, and engage in meaningful dialogue.
This not only enhances their understanding of the subject matter but also fosters critical thinking and analytical skills.
For students considering studying on our business and management course, I would offer the following advice:
Take the time to explore the different aspects of business management to identify what areas resonate with you the most.
Seize every opportunity to engage with the material beyond the classroom.

Criminology
I joined the University in 2021, prior to this I’d spent some time in policy research as well as holding lectureships at Hull and Leeds, and I’ve also taught at the University of Hong Kong.
My journey into academia started back in 2007 when I was awarded a scholarship which allowed me to complete a Masters and PhD.
Even earlier than that, I chose to study Sociology and Criminology as an Undergraduate as I wanted to understand why the world is organised the way it is (a long standing interest of mine is social inequality and power!).
Studying the social sciences allowed me to embrace my critical mind!
My research to date has predominantly been concentrated in the commercial sex industry.
I was part of a research team at Swansea looking at student involvement in the informal economy, and later was part of a research team at Edinburgh Napier conducting longitudinal work into the impact of welfare reform on vulnerable groups.
My main achievement to date was being awarded a small research grant to conduct research into illegal brothels in London and the impact of legislation in relation to this.
As part of this, I was able to unveil my findings at an academic conference in Boston which was a fantastic experience.
That can always change, but at the moment I teach modules including Social Exclusion, Explaining Crime, Research and Practice, Crimes of the Powerful and ‘Becoming a Criminologist’.
By far my favourite modules are Social Exclusion and Crimes of the Powerful, as I really get to open up critical discussions regarding the way things are in society with my students.
One of the courses I am involved in runs a Major Incident Event, which sees students travel to Ambleside and join forces with police officers, ambulance staff and police dogs to replicate a major incident.
This allows students to get some ‘on the job’ experience of being involved in working in the scene of a serious crime.
We also have just started a really exciting Criminology Society, and so far we have had trips to the University mortuary (no longer in use – Fusehill Street was once a hospital!), movie nights with pizza, and a Ghost Walk!
I’d say it is very much a community here.
All the staff know who students are, you are definitely more than just a student number.
The students, of course!
I am an avid collector of Hello Kitty items.
It is also my dream to be a contestant on the TV show ‘Gladiators’!

I was also the Chair of the British Psychological Society’s Male Psychology Section which was a really important role to help bring about awareness of the issues affecting men and boys, including domestic violence, within the wider area of psychology.
I have taught a lot of different modules in my time here, but my favourites are always the research methods modules.
I get so excited to share all the different and creative ways we can do research beyond the traditional experiments and surveys.

Diagnostic Radiography
I joined the Medical Imaging Sciences team in September 2022, ten years after graduating from the University of Cumbria myself.
I had always aspired to a career in academia but working within the national Covid-19 research team during the start of the pandemic prompted me to make the move!
After qualifying as a diagnostic radiographer, I worked in the NHS.
I gained experience working in Projectional Radiography, Fluoroscopy and C.T.
I eventually specialised in Mammography after completing my postgraduate studies in Advanced Medical Imaging at the University of Salford in 2016.
Although I work in academia now, I maintain my clinical competency through bank shifts at the hospital where I previously worked.
I am a history boffin, and a member of the British Society for the History of Radiology.
I submitted an essay titled ‘Florence Stoney: Formidable Feminism in the History of Radiology’ to their John Clifton Essay Prize late last year and was awarded 2 nd place.
Florence Stoney is considered to be the first female radiologist in Great Britain, and contributed massively to the development of radiography post-World War I.
My essay is due to be published in ‘Invisible Light’, which is the journal run by BSHR, in summer this year.
I have also recently submitted my essay to be considered for presentation at UKIO, an annual radiology conference held in Liverpool.
I am lucky to be a module leader on both our undergraduate and apprenticeship programmes.
The undergraduate module I lead is ‘Clinical Radiography 1’.
This module is for our first-year students and aims to equip them with all the practical radiography skills needed for placement.
I love teaching in our x-ray labs and sharing all my experience from clinical practice.
It’s always nice to see how much the students progress over the course of the first semester.
The apprenticeship module I lead is for our ‘top-up’ students, who are qualified assistant practitioners within clinical practice, studying to become radiographers.
This module is titled ‘Preparing for Professional Practice: The Radiographer in the Wider Context of Healthcare’ and aims to explore the many other aspects of healthcare that radiographers are involved in.
I really enjoy teaching our apprentices, as they are all very experienced clinically, which means I can use their knowledge and experience to enhance what I am teaching.
Aside from the two modules I am lead for, I assist with the teaching on many other modules, across both programmes.
The focus of my additional teaching is practical radiographic skills and clinical knowledge.
I also assist with our simulated placement sessions for the undergraduate students.
Our undergraduate course in Diagnostic Radiography is different from other courses, due to the placement opportunities offered to our students.
All students are allocated a ‘home trust’ which they remain based at for the duration of their studies.
We also offer a 50:50 split between placement and university.
We also offer our students the chance to focus their studies on a modality of their choice in the 3 rd year, which is unique to us here at Cumbria.
We host a day to showcase all the options at our Ambleside campus in 2 nd year.
The afternoon is usually spent on a lovely walk around the Lakes, or eating cake from the Apple Pie Bakery in Ambleside!
Our Radiography bridge and top-up programmes are unique.
We have students joining us from all over the country.
Thanks to our specialist apprenticeship programmes, assistant practitioners now can qualify as radiographers in 18 months.
We are also really privileged to have fantastic simulation facilities within the Institute of Health.
Aside from our live working x-ray labs and ultrasound suites, we have the immersion room.
This amazing facility allows us to plan exciting sessions, where students can quite literally immerse themselves into the topic we are teaching!
Any professional course that involves clinical placement requires dedication, determination, and a passion for what you are studying.
It’s important to be sure that your chosen course is the right one for you.

I would also recommend organising a work placement at your local hospital, to experience what really happens in Radiology!
The team are amazing.
Everyone is so passionate about their modules, and the profession.
The wider university is so supportive to both its staff and students too.
If I had not trained to be a radiographer, I would have likely become a history teacher!

I joined the University of Cumbria in November 2021.
Prior to this I worked clinically in a ‘clinical lead’ role, training newly qualified radiographers in CT and MRI imaging.
I have always loved teaching – joining Cumbria as a lecturer meant that I could pursue this further, using my previous knowledge and skills whilst learning new ones!
My background is predominantly in CT and MRI imaging.
I had worked clinically for 13 years prior to my transition into academia.
Whilst I loved clinical and I do miss it at times, academia has enabled me to challenge myself further, learning new skills but also actively using my previous clinical experience every day.
I have successfully completed my PgC Teaching and Learning in Higher Education (TLHE), and I had already achieved a PgC in Computed Tomography previously in my clinical role.
The PgC TLHE helped me develop my skills in teaching and learning, has helped build my confidence whilst arming me with new techniques, and theoretical knowledge that I now actively apply to my teaching.
I have just started my Masters in Educational Professional Practice (Higher Education pathway), and my first module is a research proposal.
This is exciting for me as research was one of my reasons for joining academia and I feel this is my first step forward.

This includes modality-specific learning pathways that the students get to choose, they are encouraged to choose a modality they have found particularly interesting and want to explore further.
They then get to study this both theoretically on this module and clinically on an adjoining module.
Other aspects of this module are focused on a multimodality approach to the patient pathway, expanding their knowledge of radiology services as a whole and applying it to real-life scenarios as they transition from student to a newly qualified radiographer.
The students enjoy this module and engagement is excellent.
In addition to our course offering exceptional academic teaching and learning.
We have amazing clinical placement sites.

Criminology and Forensic Investigation
I’ve been a member of the University of Cumbria since the beginning of 2018, teaching various modules involving forensic investigation.
I first found my interest in forensic investigation through watching CSI New York as a teenager and went on to study forensic science at university.
Ever since then, I’ve had forensic investigation in my life in some form either through study, research, or teaching.
During my undergraduate studies, I found my passion and proficiency for forensic investigation.
This lead to me publishing papers in Forensic Science International and the Journal of Forensic Identification on topics concerning fingermark enhancement and the maximisation of evidence.
Some of this work helped inform UK policy for fingermark enhancement.
When graduating my undergraduate programme, I was awarded the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences Prize and the Wright Health Group Prize from Abertay University, Dundee.
From there, I went to Northumbria University, Newcastle to complete my PhD, investigating the application of multivariate analysis to textile fibre dyes.
My current research interests look into the application of multivariate analysis and machine learning to a variety of forensic evidences.
I teach a variety of modules involving forensic investigation at the university, including “Crime Scene Investigation” and, my personal favourite, “Forensic Examination”.
In “Forensic Examination” I get to work with the students in the laboratory, teaching them the hands on skills needed to work with forensic evidence like fingermarks and body fluids.
It’s an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable module as the students love the hands on aspects of the module, and I get to see them grow in confidence as they get more experienced with the different techniques and processes.
One of the things that makes our course so different is our Major Incident Exercise – a multi-disciplinary, interprofessional event that students are involved with annually.
Students take various roles in this event each year, starting as CSIs at the scene, then moving to analysing evidence in the lab, and cumulating in them becoming the crime scene managers and leading a team of their peers.
Many other universities have tried to replicate this “Major Incident”, but we believe no one does it quite like us.
My favourite thing about teaching at Cumbria is the students.
We tend to foster a very close knit community within our modules and it’s great to be able to build that rapport with students and actively contribute to their success.

In addition, we retain excellent links with Cumbria Special Constabulary and actively encourage, mentor and support any of our students who are interested in joining as a Special Constable.
I would advise any student considering our course to be as informed as possible regarding police selection and recruiting, and the current entry standards.
I would also add that there is nothing to stop any student who is over 18 from joining the Special Constabulary (or serving as a Police Support Volunteer, in a variety of roles), even before they start their university journey.
Finally, all police forces in the country require applicants to hold a full car driving licence, so students should plan to pass their driving test before they graduate, so that they can maximise their chances of successfully applying to their force of choice

Wildlife Media
I started at the University of Cumbria in the Autumn of 2023 but before that I was parachuted in for specialist days as Professor of Practice with Wildlife Media and Film and TV.
Passing on my experiences of working within industry is something I’ve loved doing for a long time - I also run the Adventure Filmmakers’ Workshop in Canada and have done for 17 years so joining the University seemed an obvious move.
I started my professional life when I joined the BBC as a trainee straight from school.
After 6 years I resigned from my job in pursuit of a dream.
Mixing adventure, wildlife and filmmaking was where I saw my future and it took that huge leap of faith and a lot of patience to turn those dreams into reality.
Since then, during my freelance career of over 35 years, I have been involved in over 80 major film projects on all seven continents and to some of the world’s most spectacular and challenging environments.
Many of the projects in which I’ve been involved have been ‘world-firsts’.
As a keen mountaineer and adventurer, I’ve specialised in extreme location filmmaking for a long time and have taken that highly specialised skill set into wildlife film shoots for the likes of the BBC, Netflix and Disney/National Geographic.
The stories from dozens of these wild shoots are endless and the projects have been recognised internationally with a number of personal industry awards including an EMMY for Cinematography, the Royal Television Society's Camera Craft Award and the Guild of Television Camera Professionals Award for Excellence among others.
I could add that operating a camera at 29,000 feet was challenging.
I teach the Media Skills module as well as Documentary and Natural History Filmmaking modules through all 3 years of the course.
I love seeing the students turning their project ideas into reality in whatever medium they choose - be it film, photography, the written word or a mix.

Illustration
My journey with the University of Cumbria actually began as a student back in 1996, when the Brampton Road campus was still known as Cumbria College of Art and Design.
After finishing school, I pursued further education here, which laid the foundation for my creative career.
I returned to the university around 2005, initially teaching on the Graphic Design programme, before the Illustration programme had even taken shape.
At the time, I was working primarily as a freelance illustrator, having also worked as a graphic designer.
When the opportunity arose to help shape the new Illustration programme, I jumped at the chance.
It's been incredibly rewarding to be part of the programme's evolution, and I’ve been committed to it ever since.
I became Programme Leader in 2018, so it’s fair to say I feel a great deal of connection with the institute and programme.
After earning my degree in Graphic Art from Leeds Metropolitan University (now Leeds Beckett), I launched my career in the creative industries, first as a graphic designer in the entertainment sector, and then as a cartoonist for the largest greeting card company in Britain.
After several years of drawing teddy bears and designing Christmas cards, I decided to return home to Scotland and pursue a career as a freelance illustrator, specialising in editorial work for newspapers and magazines.
With representation from a major illustration agency, I’ve had the opportunity to create work for clients such as The Guardian, The Financial Times, and Warner Bros.
It was during this period as a freelance illustrator that the University reached out to me, initially to teach Photoshop.
What started as a small teaching role quickly grew, as did my enjoyment of working with passionate and creative students.
Like many in academia, my transition from industry to teaching began quite organically, and I continue to find immense satisfaction in helping the next generation of designers and illustrators develop their skills.
I have been working on an ongoing project called ‘On the X95’ for many years.
The project began during my time as a freelance illustrator, around the time I embarked on my academic journey.
The project, which involves documenting my fellow commuters on the X95 bus between my hometown and Carlisle, was where an interest in reportage illustration first took root.
Using a sketchbook and, more recently, an iPad, I record passengers as they read, look out of windows, chat and (mainly) look at their phones.
Many of the drawings have been shared on Instagram (@dwaynesdoodles) and published in zines and books which I have sold globally.
I enjoy the fact that when I post these books across the world my fellow commuters are travelling far beyond their original bus journey’s destination.
As my professional focus shifted from the illustration industry to academia, I took the opportunity to revisit and reassess my own creative output—a process that became one of the most rewarding aspects of a professional transition.
In 2016, I began an MA in Creative Practice here at the University of Cumbria, balancing this with my teaching responsibilities.
This experience allowed me to deeply examine my creative process, which, at the time, had become primarily concerned with the editorial and client-based work I had been producing for nearly a decade.
Through the MA in Creative Practice, I was able to step away from that established body of work and reconnect with what has always excited me about illustration and graphic art: drawing.
The MA in Creative Practice allowed me to devote all my creativity to this passion.
My MA work, which evolved from years of drawing commuters on a bus, focused on reportage illustration, where I embraced a back-to-basics approach with just a sketchbook and pen.
Through reportage drawing, I explored a variety of subjects, including family relationships, health crises, cottage industries, and the liminal space and experience of a hospital waiting room.
An animation I produced as part of a project exploring a family during a health crisis won an award at a prestigious creative showcase in 2017, and my final project, produced in conjunction with a local hospital, remains one of the most rewarding experiences of my creative career.
My primary interest and research subject continues to be observational drawing though in recent years, I have also dedicated considerable effort to exploring how online and digital tools can enhance the delivery and clarity of the illustration programme.
This includes researching and implementing digital solutions to streamline, increase accessibility and clarity to all aspects of teaching, learning, and assessment processes.
This ongoing research aims to integrate these digital tools effectively with long-standing and traditional approaches ensuring that students benefit from a comprehensive and modern approach to their education.
I teach across all practical illustration modules, which is to say modules with a focus on the essential and technical skills of conceiving of and producing illustration work.
One of the most enjoyable aspects of any module is the opportunity to share new artists and their work with students—and to have them introduce me to artists I may not have encountered before.
The programme is at its best when the roles of teacher and student dissolve, and we all become enthusiasts (I’m more than comfortable being called a nerd or a geek) united by a shared passion.
However, the most rewarding part of my job is witnessing a student make a breakthrough.
Whether it’s producing a fantastic, professional-standard outcome for a project or overcoming a small but personally significant challenge, these moments are incredibly fulfilling.
We put a lot of effort into developing our assessment briefs, ensuring they align with creative development and industry practices.
When a student fully engages with their work and experiences growth as a result, it’s immensely rewarding.
One of the things that makes our illustration programme stand out is its close relationship with the Graphic Design programme here at the University of Cumbria.
Illustration and graphic design share a common language and understanding, and being part of a shared, creative hub enhances both disciplines.
Our expansive, open-plan studio, shared by all years of both programmes, fosters an environment where ideas, understanding, and experimentation flow freely, enriching the learning experience of students studying both subjects.
Additionally, we pride ourselves on our strong industry connections and the opportunities we provide for our students to engage with professionals.
Through our 'An Audience with...' programme, we regularly host a diverse range of guest speakers from illustration and related industries.
Recent guests include Glyn Dillon (known for designing Robert Pattinson’s Batsuit), Dermot Power (concept artist for Harry Potter, Wednesday, Star Wars), Sara Ogilvie (The Folio Society, Bloomsbury Publishing), and comic artist Duncan Fegredo (Hellboy).
These sessions offer students the chance to interact directly with leading practitioners, ask questions, and gain insights that are directly relevant to their own work and ambitions for the future.
There are timeless pieces of advice that have guided commercial illustration for over 150 years: draw from observation regularly, practice and develop sophisticated skills with a variety of media and remain broadly curious by absorbing influences from diverse sources.
However, in today’s landscape, my top piece of advice for prospective students is to recognise that not all illustration on social media, regardless of scale of its popularity, translates to having strong commercial prospects.
Our programme is designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge for a rewarding, lifelong career in illustration.
This involves broadening your creative awareness, embracing new directions, and understanding that social media likes don’t always reflect commercial viability.
We strive to ensure that by the end of your time with us, you’re producing work that you couldn’t have imagined at the start and that isn’t bound by existing ‘style’ or trend.
If you leave having only improved on what you already knew, none of us have done our job properly (most of all you).
Our goal is for you to push beyond your current abilities and explore new, as yet untapped, creative possibilities.
My favourite thing about leading the illustration programme at The University of Cumbria is the sense of community.
Being part of a small team in a small institution means I actually get to know my students.
I know who’s into dark gothic stuff, who still watches Gravity Falls, who reads Batman, and who enjoys Harry Potter films.
These connections allow us to discuss our subject in a way that’s directly applicable to the individual, whether it’s suggesting an artist I’ve discovered on Instagram, a particular material or approach for a specific project or a useful Photoshop tutorial that will take a student’s work to the next level.
At its best, my job is all about being an illustration enthusiast surrounded by fellow enthusiasts.
It’s incredibly fulfilling to spend my days discussing illustration, exploring new work, and engaging in creative projects with others who share the same passion.
Also the illustration section in our library.
And the cheese scones from our canteen.
I used to work in forestry so am one of the few lumberjacks who now teaches illustration at an undergraduate level.

I started as a Lecturer in Zoology at the University of Cumbria in 2024.
I have been a zoologist for over 25 years, specializing in the fields of animal behaviour and behavioural ecology.
I have been interested in animals and the natural world from an early age, and this is what led me to become a professional zoologist.
I have since realized how important statistical modelling is for scientific research of all kinds, so I am also now a qualified statistician, and enjoy teaching these skills to students as an important part of their zoological and scientific training.
I have previously been a lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University and Leeds University.
I was drawn to Carlisle and the University of Cumbria, in large part, by the beautiful surrounding countryside and the unique opportunities this provides for teaching in the field.

This means we have a much closer relationship with the students.
It also enables us to use teaching methods that engage the students much more than a plain lecture, such as seminars and group discussions.

Whilst you are a member of the University, IT systems and electronic information will play a huge role in your everyday life.
We have made it easier for you to access your most commonly used systems such as your email, your timetable or your library systems, by collecting them together into a single web page, known as the “ Student Hub ”.
This means you only need to sign on once and you are automatically logged in to your other systems for learning and collaboration.

We have a number of systems that will be used within your course to support your learning, the main one being our virtual learning environment (VLE), Blackboard .
Most courses make use of this system to give you access to learning resources and materials (such as access to lecture slides and handouts, programme and module information, etc.), links to digital reading lists and access to collaborative online learning spaces such as discussion boards.
Blackboard is also used to make announcements and to update you on learning opportunities within your course.
As well as the main Blackboard VLE we also use Blackboard Collaborate , a webinar tool built into Blackboard.
This will be used for online teaching on your course, as well as for additional support webinars offered by Student Services.
Some courses also utilise PebblePad for electronic portfolios.
It’s a very flexible system that allows you to store digital assets (documents, photos, videos, etc.) in one place.
These assets can be used to develop online eportfolios, support reflective commentaries, personal development planning, recording of progress and many more activities.
You can share elements of your PebblePad account with peers, tutors and people outside the University who may be interested in your progress.
Both Blackboard and PebblePad have mobile apps which allow you to access and add to information from your mobile device.
Microsoft Teams can be used for one to one tutorials with your personal tutor, as well as for group study with your fellow students.
We also have modern library and study environments for social and informal study, silent and individual study, all fully integrated with IT facilities and also with self-service technologies for convenient book loans, laptop loans and online payments.
