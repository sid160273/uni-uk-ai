Aberystwyth University students
09 July 2025
Aberystwyth University is the top university in Wales for student satisfaction for the tenth year in a row according to the latest survey of students’ opinions on the quality of their courses.
The 2025 edition of the authoritative National Student Survey (NSS), which is published today, has been compiled using over 357,000 student responses from across the UK.
With an improved and consistently high student satisfaction rate, 86% of Aberystwyth University students are satisfied with the quality of their course, 4 percentage points above the sector average in Wales.
Based on the higher education institutions featured in the latest edition of The Times / Sunday Times Good University Guide, 90% of the University’s students are satisfied with their teaching, putting Aberystwyth in the top 10 in the UK.
Aberystwyth also features in the UK top 5 for ‘Academic Support’ and ‘Learning Resources’ and in the top 10 in the UK for ‘Assessment and Feedback’ and ‘Organisation and Management.
Aberystwyth also outperforms the UK sector in all seven core themes that are featured in this year’s survey: Teaching on My Course, Learning Opportunities, Assessment and Feedback, Academic Support, Organisation and Management, Learning Resource and Student Voice.
Professor Anwen Jones, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Education and Student Experience at Aberystwyth University, said:
“This is fantastic news.
Our University has a long-standing and enviable reputation for student satisfaction and today’s results underline that.
They demonstrate that Aberystwyth University is rated by our students as one of the best universities in the UK, reflecting the dedication of our staff to provide the best possible learning experience.
“The survey results go to show that we are an excellent place to learn, and that our teaching is simply outstanding.
“Aberystwyth is an inclusive, welcoming and supportive place, located in one of the most inspiring locations to live and study in the UK.
Our town is a friendly and vibrant community, and a safe and affordable place that welcomes staff and students from around the world.”
Undeb Aber, the Students’ Union at the University, said:
“It is great to see the NSS once again backing up what we already know - Aberystwyth University offers students a brilliant experience.
We are proud to work side by side with staff at the University to make sure that Aber students love student life.
This result is testament to the amazing work that continues to happen right across the institution.”
The NSS is an annual survey of students in universities, colleges and other providers across the UK.
Final-year undergraduate students are asked to score their university across a wide range of measures of student satisfaction.
Students in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were also invited to express their overall satisfaction with their university.
The NSS is managed by the Office for Students on behalf of the UK funding and regulatory bodies – the Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland), the Scottish Funding Council and Medr.

Dr Manudeo Singh, Department of Geography and Earth Science, Aberystwyth University
28 August 2025
Writing in The Conversation, Dr Manudeo Singh explains how Himalayan floods are natural, but poor planning turns rain into disaster.
On August 5, a cloudburst near the Kheer Ganga river triggered a flash flood that tore through Dharali, a village in the Indian Himalayas.
Within minutes, the river swelled with water, mud and debris, sweeping away homes, roads and lives.
Every monsoon season, the Himalayas see similar tragedies – flash floods caused by cloudbursts or glacial lake outbursts.
The first explanation we often hear is climate change.
Extreme rainfall and melting glaciers are part of our warming world, but that is only half the story.
The other half lies in where and how we build.
A cloudburst is an extreme, sudden downpour – often more than 100mm of rain in just an hour, falling over a small area.
It’s like the sky suddenly emptying a huge bucket of water over the mountainside.
A glacial lake outburst flood happens when a lake formed by melting glaciers bursts through its natural dam of ice or loose rock, releasing a sudden torrent downstream.
Both cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts send huge volumes of water rushing down steep valleys.
On their way, they pick up mud, rocks and trees, turning into debris-laden flash floods that sweep away whatever lies in their path.
These are natural events in higher mountainous regions, such as the Himalayas.
They cannot be stopped.
What makes them disasters is when towns, hotels and roads are built directly where these floods predictably flow.
To understand why the damage is so severe, we need to look at the land itself.
Geomorphology is the study of how Earth’s surface is shaped.
It shows us how rivers, slopes and valleys have been formed and modified over time by floods, landslides and debris flows.
In the Himalayas, many safe-looking places are anything but.
Take the alluvial fan , which is a cone-shaped pile of sand, gravel and silt that forms where a steep stream slows and drops the debris it carries.
Over time, repeated floods build up this fan.
It looks flat and inviting – perfect for a settlement, hotel, or car park – but when the next flash flood happens, the water and debris flow straight back down, burying whatever is built there.
This is not theory but history repeating itself.
Dharali, which is built around the ancient Kalp Kedar Hindu temple , has faced flash floods before.
Records show the temple has been buried multiple times, most recently in 2013 .
This also highlights our short memory span.
Rising temperatures can lead to more intense and erratic rainfall, and this does raise the likelihood of cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts.
But focusing only on climate change makes disasters sound unavoidable.
In reality, much of the destruction is preventable.
Poor planning and reckless construction have put people in harm’s way.
Roads, hotels, even entire towns, are expanding into zones geomorphology tells us are flood prone.
When disaster follows, we blame the climate.
But the harder truth is that our own decisions magnify the risks.
Ignoring geomorphology has serious consequences.
For governments, it means billions spent on disaster relief and rebuilding after every monsoon.
For developers, it means investments washed away in a single night.
For tourists, it means the risk of being caught in floods during what should be a holiday.
And for mountain communities, it means living in constant danger.
What is needed is geomorphic literacy.
Planners, policymakers, developers and citizens need to read the land and respect its signals.
The land itself tells us where floods have happened before, and where they will happen again.
Listening to it can save lives.
Flash floods due to cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts are a natural part of the Himalayan monsoon.
They cannot be prevented, and climate change may make them more frequent.
But the devastation they cause is not inevitable – it is shaped by where and how we build.
Geomorphology is nature’s diary, showing where water and debris have flowed for centuries.
Learning to read it can keep people safe.
The Dharali disaster is a painful reminder that the real danger is not only in the sky, but in our failure to understand and respect the land beneath our feet.
Unless we take that lesson seriously and build geomorphic awareness into planning, policy making and public understanding, tragedies like Dharali will keep happening, year after year.

27 August 2025
To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, we’re pitting Jane Austen’s much-loved novels against each other in a battle of wit, charm and romance.
Six leading Austen experts have made their case for her ultimate novel, but the winner is down to you.
Cast your vote in the poll at the end of the article, and let us know the reason for your choice in the comments.
This is Jane Austen Fight Club – it’s bonnets at dawn…
Championed by Lucy Thompson, lecturer in 19th-century literature and creative writing, Aberystwyth University
Sense and Sensibility is Austen’s most quietly radical novel.
As her first published work, it may be less polished than her later fiction, but it is no less incisive.
It lays bare the emotional cost of living in a world governed by reputation, family obligation and gendered expectation.
Excluded from inheritance and displaced from their home, the Dashwood sisters must navigate constant scrutiny.
Through Elinor and Marianne, Austen dramatises two strategies for survival in a society obsessed with appearances.
Born from an earlier epistolary draft , the novel retains a sharp interest in how information circulates and misleads.
Gossip doesn’t just constrain; it distorts.
Letters are spied upon, conversations overheard.
Assumptions take on the weight of fact.
In this world, everyone watches – but not everyone truly sees.
Sense and Sensibility may wear a quieter face than Emma or Pride and Prejudice, but it is Austen’s sharpest early critique of how appearances govern lives.
This article is part of a series commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth .
Despite having published only six books, she is one of the best-known authors in history.
These articles explore the legacy and life of this incredible writer.
Championed by Andrew McInnes, reader in English literature, Edge Hill University
Everyone already knows the best Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice .
Why?
Elizabeth Bennet.
Lizzy is so charismatic that you might mistake the novel’s title for an abstract problem, and not Darcy’s pride versus her prejudice.
We share her prejudices because Austen makes them so delicious.
We roll our eyes at Mrs Bennet because Lizzy finds her exasperating.
Wickham is seductive because he satisfies our inner bitch.
And we fall in love with Darcy alongside Lizzy.
Pride and Prejudice is the funniest and sexiest of Austen’s novels.
In it, she allows herself a swoon-worthy romance without a hitch.
Unlike Northanger Abbey’s Henry Tilney, Darcy doesn’t fall in love because Lizzy adores him, but falls first.
Darcy is a complex man – shy, domineering, funny – and not a drip like Eds Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) or Bertram (Mansfield Park).
And unlike Emma, Lizzy builds healthy relationships with other women.
Austen called Pride and Prejudice “too light and bright and sparkling” and joked that it could do with an essay on Walter Scott or Napoleon.
But we know that would be a crime.
It is just light and bright and sparkling enough to outshine the others.
Championed by Amanda Vickery, professor in early modern history, Queen Mary University of London
Pride and Prejudice is often the first grown-up novel young girls read, but Mansfield Park is the only Austen novel about a little girl growing up.
All Austen’s fictions are versions of the female-centred courtship novel, usually covering a single year, with the heroine safely married to a deserving gentleman by the last page.
Yet her heroines are mostly formed young women.
Only in Mansfield Park do we meet our heroine as a little girl – and a puny and cowering little girl at that.
Mansfield Park is Austen’s bildungsroman (the novel of becoming) on a par with that other girls’ classic, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847).
Like poor, plain Jane, Fanny Price is a girl of no consequence – a Cinderella figure in a mansion of the rich and selfish.
Fanny is shy, frail and physically timid, but she is not a moral coward.
She learns to bear her lot with dignity, and to hold fast to what she believes.
By volume three, Fanny is at last the centre of her own story.
Mansfield Park is not just a love story, it is a life story.
Championed by Ruvani Ranasinha, professor of global literature, King’s College London
Emma Woodhouse is Jane Austen’s most vividly realised, proto-feminist heroine.
Witty, clever and attractive, Emma is supremely self-confident and flawed.
She challenges every expectation of female propriety and is full of contradictions: self-centred yet deeply attached to her hypochondriac, indulgent father; snobbish but kind.
Emma revels in meddling in the romantic lives of others, especially her protégée, Harriet Smith.
When her carefully laid plans unravel, the busybody makes mortifying mistakes and learns self-knowledge: “It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr Knightley must marry no-one but herself!”
All Austen’s novels are shot through with the awareness of the role of wealth and class in marriage.
But Emma – “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds” – is free from the intense competition among the women for young men with positions and prospects.
At the same time, she attracts men like Mr Elton seeking women with landed connections and dowries.
This is why the novel both responds to Austen’s historical moment and speaks to our own.
Championed by Octavia Cox, departmental lecturer in English literature, University of Oxford
Northanger Abbey is a riot of jokes.
Nobody and nothing is spared: not the heroine, convention, society – even readers.
There’s everything marvellous you’d expect from an Austen novel (sharp satire of patriarchy and socioeconomic weaponisation, laughter at human absurdity and pompousness, beautifully wrought witty expression, a rollicking good yarn, irony), but with extra sass.
Its bombastic intrusive authorial narrative voice (perhaps the closest we get to Austen’s own), constantly makes in-jokes with readers about the action.
It’s Austen’s most meta-fictional text, playing with readers’ expectations about novels (for example, joking that her novel, ironically, “is a new circumstance in romance” despite depicting nothing “new in common life”).
Its “defence of the novel” passage is a proto-feminist rallying call-to-arms for female authors to celebrate each other’s work.
Northanger Abbey’s meta-fictionality reveals much about Austen’s aim and style as an author, making it a must-read for all Austen-lovers.
Oh, and it’s funny.
Damned funny.
Championed by Richard de Ritter, lecturer in English literature, University of Leeds
Persuasion contains the greatest love letter in all English literature.
It is the culmination of a slow-burning romance between the heroine, Anne Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, the man she has loved for eight long years.
“You pierce my soul,” Wentworth writes to Anne with striking vulnerability: “I am half agony, half hope.
Tell me not that I am too late.” (Spoiler: he is not too late.)
The brilliance of Persuasion lies in the depiction of its complex heroine.
At 27, Anne Elliot is older and wiser than Austen’s earlier protagonists.
Disregarded by her comically narcissistic family, the depth of Anne’s personality is revealed by Austen’s prose style, which is at its most luminous and expressive.
Readers are plunged into the mind of the novel’s heroine.
We witness her innermost thoughts and feelings as she negotiates the awkwardness, excitement and, finally, the sheer joy of embracing a future with Wentworth.
Persuasion is the final novel that Austen completed before her death in 1817: she was at the peak of her powers.
It is her most moving and her greatest work.
Now the experts have made their case, it’s your turn to decide which of Austen’s six completed novels is her best work.
Vote in the poll below to and see if our other readers agree with you.

Guglielmo Persiani collecting water samples from abandoned mines in the south Wales coalfield.
26 August 2025
With an estimated one-quarter of UK properties located above abandoned coal mines, the potential for geothermal heating is vast.
A pioneering heat exchange system set up in 2023 warms 350 homes and several businesses in Gateshead using naturally heated mine water.
A larger project is underway in County Durham, where 1,500 homes will be heated entirely by this method.
The groundwater in flooded former coal workings is heated by natural geothermal processes and is a fertile breeding ground for naturally occurring bacteria.
These microbes can significantly influence the chemistry of mine water, and have implications for the efficiency and longevity of geothermal systems.
A team of microbiologists from Aberystwyth University sampled the water flowing out of old mine workings in south Wales and used advanced DNA sequencing to analyse bacterial populations and map the multitude of microbes present.
Bacteria can impact geothermal energy capture in many ways, including by affecting the chemistry of the water used, corroding pipes, and biofouling - the accumulation of biological substances on the heat transfer surfaces which reduces performance and efficiency.
Professor in Microbial Geochemistry at Aberystwyth University, Andy Mitchell, said:
“The water in flooded coal mines is a vast underused source of low-carbon energy which could heat homes and businesses across Britain.
Until now, evaluating the potential of this resource as a geothermal heat source has involved temperature testing and assessing whether water can be successfully extracted and reinjected into a different coal seam after heat has been recovered.
“However, it is also vital to understand how microbial activity might affect the long-term viability of mine water heat exchanger installations.”
Published in FEMS Microbiology Ecology , the research has uncovered how underground microbial communities play an important role in cycling iron and sulphur - processes that can influence the acidity, metal content, and overall quality of groundwater.
Dr Arwyn Edwards, Director of the University's Interdisciplinary Centre for Environmental Microbiology, said:
“In the global context, this study shows that the abandoned coal mines of south Wales offer a uniquely helpful insight into the exotic lives of the many trillions of trillions of microbes hidden deep underground.”
“Our findings show that microbial communities in these mine waters are not randomly distributed.
Instead, they are strongly influenced by the underlying geology and the way groundwater flows through the coalfield.
These bacteria’s life cycles and activities could contribute to the warmth of the waters rising up from deep in the coalfield, and they are key players in shaping the geochemistry of mine waters.
Understanding their role is crucial for designing efficient and resilient geothermal systems.”
Much of the research was undertaken by Dr André Soares while he was a PhD student at Aberystwyth University, supervised by Professor Andy Mitchell and Dr Arwyn Edwards; and by Dr Sara Rassner, Research Fellow in the Interdisciplinary Centre for Environmental Microbiology at Aberystwyth University.
The research was supported by the Sêr Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and the Environment project Geo-Carb-Cymru and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Dr Andrew Filmer, Department of Theatre Film & Television Studies
The relaunching of Glasgow’s famous Citizens Theatre – known locally as the “Citz” – marks the end of a significant seven-year redevelopment project that has seen the people of the city go without a cherished cultural landmark.
It also highlights wider trends in how historic theatres are being redeveloped to make them more accessible, socially connected and sustainable while also preserving their heritage.
Extensive work has been done to improve almost all areas of the theatre, from foyer spaces and audience access, to sightlines in the auditorium and technical facilities.
The redevelopment makes a feature of the Citizens’ history by revealing previously hidden sandstone walls in the foyer, and restoring its beloved statues of William Shakespeare, Robert Burns and assorted Greek goddesses to their position above the front entrance.
Opened in 1878 as the Royal Princess’s Theatre, the building has been the home of the Citizens Theatre Company since 1945, known for its bold stage productions, its youth and community theatre and participatory arts programmes.
Like many theatres, the Citizens has been continuously adapted over its 147-year history.
In 1977 its neoclassical facade was removed following an earlier fire, and in 1989 a new foyer space and studio theatre were added.
The current redevelopment, which began in 2018, was undertaken to ensure the building continues to serve the needs of the company and its community in the working-class Gorbals area, south of the river Clyde.
The redevelopment and restoration of older theatres such as the Citizens has become important as their social value and anchoring presence in towns and cities has been recognised.
And of course it makes better sense environmentally and economically to reimagine and modernise old buildings than construct new ones.
Recent trends in redevelopments such as the Citizens provide insights into our shifting cultural values.
Theatres are being renovated and redeveloped to make them more accessible and inclusive, more energy efficient and more flexible, while also keeping their history and heritage at the heart of the project.
Accessibility is a key feature of the redeveloped Citizens, reflecting the importance of the theatre as a place for social connection, community and inclusion.
Attention has been focused on connecting the theatre to its urban environment, and improving the physical accessibility of audience spaces through step-free entrances, better circulation and lifts.
Audiences will also be able to glimpse views of backstage activities.
Theatres increasingly serve an expanded social role with cafes, bars and spaces for exhibitions, not to mention education and participation programmes.
Redesigned foyers signal this spatially, reinvented as public spaces.
The Bristol Old Vic , which reopened in 2021, has a substantial new foyer which connects the existing theatre to the street, serves as a social space and can house events and performances.
Energy efficiency measures and lower carbon emissions are another factor in recent redevelopments, reflecting the need to address the climate emergency.
According to a 2008 report by the Greater London Authority, around 80% of carbon emissions produced by London’s theatres come from building operation.
Lowering energy consumption through energy efficiency measures like insulation, passive ventilation , and lighting controls are increasingly common.
Even relatively modern civic theatres from the late 20th century are hugely inefficient compared with contemporary standards and technologies.
Theatr Clwyd in Mold, first opened in 1976 and recently refurbished, has replaced gas heating with air-source heat pumps, solar panels and natural ventilation.
The renovated theatre now has “green” walls and roofs and has avoided significant use of concrete in favour of more sustainable materials.
Another feature in redeveloping older theatres is the need to design in flexibility so venues can house multiple types of events and also be adaptable for new art forms and technologies.
Regular schedules for maintenance and the gradual upgrade of electrical and mechanical systems are being introduced to avoid less frequent, and more costly, redevelopments.
In July 2022 the Sydney Opera House completed a ten-year renewal programme which has seen significant upgrade of its concert hall.
New features including movable wooden acoustic panels, automated systems to change the stage level and sound dampening drapes enable it to better accommodate different musical performances and events.
Theatres play an important role in the social and cultural life of towns and cities.
The mix of old and new features in the redeveloped Citizens’ Theatre is a final important aspect which is common to all redevelopment projects.
Theatres anchor communities, serving as places of memory and sites for the stories which connect us to each other, to the past and to our possible futures.
The reopening of Glasgow’s most famous theatre reflects how we value accessibility, social connection and sustainability.
Theatres are never just performance spaces, but rather places which support our shared cultural life.
The decisions we are making in their renewal today reveal a positive vision of the cultural life we want to sustain in the years ahead.

You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you”, says world famous primatologist Jane Goodall.
Here at Aberystwyth University we recognise this, and have accordingly developed a number of degrees specifically to ensure students understand and can help develop solutions for the biggest challenge facing the planet and its people today, Climate Change.
This isnât just a challenge for scientists, so we have developed a wide range of Climate Change-related degrees across diverse subject areas, spanning the Arts/Humanities and the Sciences:
Biology and Climate Change: looking at the how humans have brought about change to the processes underlying climate change, and the impact of climate change on biodiversity at the level of species, habitat and ecosystem.
BSc Biology and Climate Change FC71 * BSc Biology and Climate Change (with integrated year in industry) FC72 * BSc Biology and Climate Change with foundation year FC7F *
Business and Climate Change: preparing future business leaders to tackle climate change impacts through the development of meaningful corporate social responsibility strategies and practices, by imparting both a knowledge of the relevant science and encouraging the skills to lead a successful sustainable business.
BSc Business and Climate Change FN71 *
Economics and Climate Change: combining a knowledge of the science underpinning climate change, combined with a range of economic tools to allow understanding and development of policies and incentives supporting the move to a carbon neutral economy.
BSc Economics and Climate Change FL71
English Studies and Climate Change: combining a knowledge of climate science with a critical understanding of the debates surrounding the subject, and investigation of how climate change and environmental degradation have been communicated in literature from the nineteenth century to the present day.
BA English Studies and Climate Change FQ73
International Relations and Climate Change: the global climate emergency can only be tackled if it secures co-operation from the local to national, regional and global level, so this innovative degree looks at how states and societies manage the planetâs resources and ecological systems, and how they can develop effective societal and political solutions to the issue.
BA International Relations and Climate Change (BA, 3 years) BA International Relations and Climate Change (with integrated year in industry) (BA, 4 years)
*Welsh medium provision available in these schemes
These new schemes complement and extend Aberystwyth Universityâs long-established sector-leading provision in environmental change in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences , and in the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences including human and physical geography as well as environmental science, environmental earth science and sociology throughout which climate change is a fundamental theme.
In partnership with Channel Talent, world class Aberystwyth academics have been running live webinars discussing Climate Change in regard to their subject area.
Recordings of these discussions are also kept on these pages.
In this Politics webinar for school and college students and teachers, Professor Milja Kurki from Aberystwyth University asks How do we Tackle Climate Change and What do Political Ideologies Have to do With It?â
Climate change and related ecological challenges present some fundamental challenges to politics on the planet: local, national and global.
But how can climate change be tackled when states and communities often focus on securing their own survival and prosperity, at the expense of othersâ?
And what is the relevance of âpolitical ideologiesâ in addressing the cutting edge challenges of climate change?
In this session, Milja shows how both classical and more recently developed political ideologies are highly relevant to todayâs climate debates and demonstrates how they are tied up with bringing about change â if very different kinds of change!
Business: Exploring The Reciprocal Relationship Of Business And Climate Change With Professor Andrew Thomas , Dr Ian Harris & Mr Tim Gillison From Aberystwyth University
In this Business webinar for school and college students and teachers, Professor Andrew Thomas, Dr Ian Harris, and Mr Tim Gillison, from Aberystwyth Business School introduce: Exploring the Reciprocal Relationship of Business and Climate Change?
Typically evaluated in business theory as part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) the reciprocal impacts of business and climate change are becoming significantly expanded; predicated by new generations of consumers and the greater awareness they bring of the effects consumption has on the environment and climate change, and ultimately âtheir futureâ.
The developed world for the last 50 years has seen the age of the corporate, organisations designed to maximise profit for their investors with few checks and balances on their behaviour and the consequences of their actions.
However, climate change and related ecological challenges present new and fundamental challenges to business: local, national and global.
But how can climate change be tackled when business communities typically focus on securing their survival and prosperity, at the expense of others?
And what is the relevance of âethical business ideologiesâ in addressing the cutting edge challenges of climate change?
An introductory session that supports Level 3 Business specification content such as Business Management and Leadership, Choosing Strategic Direction, Operations and Marketing Decision Making.

Biology: The Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity with Dr Jim Provan and Dr Gemma Beatty .
One of the great ironies of the challenges facing the planet in this era of climate change is that of the countless species that inhabit the Earth.
It is the actions of just one of these species that could have profound impacts on the vast majority of the others.
What will these impacts be?
In the face of climate change, species can either adapt to new conditions, migrate to more suitable habitats, or â ultimately â become extinct.
This webinar will explore the threats faced by the entire spectrum of biodiversity in our rapidly changing world, and the capacity of different species to respond to these threats.
In this interactive lecture for school/college students and teachers, Professor Mark Whitehead will outline the key sustainability issues facing the planet and the challenges that exist when trying to secure a more sustainable future for humanity .
The session will reflect on population growth, energy use, food and water supply, and climate change.
It will also consider the different ways in which we can think about and measure sustainability.
Students will be asked regular questions during the session and will be expected to complete a short five minute exercise related to Sustainable Development Goals.
The key session objectives are:
In this Economics webinar for school and college students and teachers, Professor Mike Christie from Aberystwyth Universityâs Business School will discuss: Externalities and policy response
When firms make decisions about what, and how much, to produce, they tend to only consider their private costs and benefits, thus maximising their profits.
Similarly, when an individual consumes a good, they also focus on their private costs and benefits to maximise their utility.
In both cases, their decisions tend to ignore external costs and benefits.
For example, if John flies to Rome for a weekend break, he will consider the costs of his flight and accommodation and weighs these up against the benefits he receives from the vacation.
However, his decision will not include the externality costs of the carbon emitted while flying and the subsequent impacts of climate change.
An externality is thus the cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.
In Johnâs case, the externality is the climate change impacts of the emitted carbon.
Externalities are often the root cause of many environmental problems including climate change.
In this webinar, we will draw on economic theory to discuss: (i) the externality impacts of climate change , and (ii) the national / international policy responses to tackle climate change .
Policy responses discussed will include: the Stern Review on the Economics of climate change, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
This webinar is targeted to support AS / A (Level 3) Economic specifications, including Market failure, Externalities, Government intervention, Policy instruments and Global economics.
This Webinar sets a baseline for the innovative, new BSc Economics and Climate Change degree, which will be offered by Aberystwyth University from September 2020.
In this webinar for school/college students and teachers, Dr Neal Alexander from Aberystwyth University explores the following matters:
This entertaining yet challenging interactive session aims:
In this interactive lecture, physicists ( Dr Rachel Cross & Dr Huw Morgan ) from Aberystwyth University will discuss how we are working on issues linked to climate change.
Students will be asked regular questions during the session and are free to asks questions throughout.
Physics touches many aspects of our everyday life in ways you may not realise; from the study of the very small in materials physics to the very large in space physics.
In this session we will consider the different careers using physics and some of the ways physics is being used to investigate the realities of climate change.
The session will discuss the fundamental physics behind some of the effects of climate change being observed, how we use space weather observations, and the research into renewable energy sources, such as solar, to meet our rising energy demands in a sustainable way.
The key topics discussed in this session are:

A film produced by Rhodri SiÃ´n from Nebo, Llanrwst, who graduated in Professional Welsh in 2016.

The work received great praise from the examiners, and was awarded a First Class mark.
The film 'Cymru Dafydd ap Gwilym' provides a clear and concise introduction to the life and work of one of the great poets of Wales and Europe in the recent Middle Ages.
Dr Rhianedd Jewel is Lecturer in Professional Welsh in the Department of Welsh and Celtic Studies.
Her research focus is in translation, particularly literary translations from European languages into Welsh.
This lecture is based on Rhianeddâs research into the Welsh translations of Samuel Beckettâs Samuel Beckettâs absurd ist plays.
These plays have only been tackled by two Welsh translators, both of whom were renowned Welsh poets, dramatists and authors in the ir own right: Gwyn Thomas and Saunders Lewis.
A close analysis of the ir Beckettian translations shows how the y adapted the French plays for a Welsh audience, making the m both linguistically and culturally Welsh.
One of the se translators, however, was far less faithful to the original work than the other, and the resulting Welsh play was in fact significantly different from Beckettâs creation.
This lecture considers questions such as âto what extent should a translator choose to adapt a pieceâ and âwhat do those choices teach us in turn about the translator?â

These debates on COVID19 did not emerge in a vacuum, but draw on two decades of initiatives in âglobal healthâ.
This webinar identifies the politics of global health â how it developed, what it means and what the problems are with the politics of global health.

Dafydd ap Gwilym is one of walesâ most exciting poets.
Although many centuries have passed since he travelled the country reciting his poems, his words still enchant us to this day.
He is our most famous poet and debatably his most famous poem is âTrafferth Mewn Tafarnâ.
In this poem Dafydd tells a story about him trying to love a girl one night.
He encounters many problems along his journey through the darkness, this includes waking everyone up and waking three very angry Englishmen up.
But did you know that Dafydd was not actually in a âPubâ and the story was far more serious?
This webinar will bring Dafyddâs words alive and allow us to hear is voice again, close to seven centuries after the poem was written.

'The Challenges of 2030' Webinar Series
A new webinar series, âThe Challenges of 2030â, views the problems of the not so distant future through the lens of a variety of different subjects such as Geography, History, Theatre & Performance, Business and Criminology.
In conjunction with Channel Talent, we aim to give you an insight into the teaching methods and research of University lecturers whilst discussing the problems that the next generation of students will be facing in the coming decade.
Previous Episodes
In the first event in Aberystwythâs The Challenges of 2030 series, Professor Mark Whitehead from the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences presented Geography In A Digital Age: Reflections On The Smart Technology Revolution .
The session provides viewers with a critical introduction to the ways in which smart technology is changing our lives and particular attention will be given to the ways in which smart technology is reshaping our social and working lives.
Mark also explored the issues of surveillance and injustice that are associated with the smart technology revolution.
As part of Aberystwythâs exciting The Challenges of 2030 series, Dr Arddun Arwyn from the Department of History & Welsh History presented Fake News, Conspiracy Theories and Disinformation: Past, Present and Future .
Fake News, conspiracy theories and disinformation are prominent features of our society today.
They have a great impact on politics, are eroding trust and are creating dangerous divisions.
These issues are also a big challenge for our future.
Fake news is not, however, a new phenomenon.
There are numerous examples throughout history when disinformation and conspiracy theories have impacted politics and society.
This webinar explores the detrimental effect of disinformation on German politics and society in the Third Reich and highlights how the skills of the historian in critical thinking, fact checking, and analysis are central to combatting disinformation in the future.
As part of Aberystwythâs exciting The Challenges of 2030 series, Dr Louise Ritchie from the Department of Theatre, Film & Television Studies presented Theatre & Performance â The Show Must Go On .
For centuries Theatres have been celebrated as a place to gather; sharing and experiencing as part of a collective.
In our current covid world, theatre venues have become a restricted place, out of bounds and with limited access.
This physical closure raises questions about who theatre is for and how it reaches audiences.
As we look to the future, the session will focus on Theatre and Performance makers who work outside of traditional theatre venues and the ways in which they are connecting with audiences in new and interesting way.
As part of Aberystwythâs exciting The Challenges of 2030 series, Dr Lowri Cunnington Wynn from Department of Law & Criminology presents Criminologyâs Contribution To The Climate Crisis .
There is no doubt that the world is facing a significant and complex climate crisis.
Current debates within Criminology adopt a Green perspective, and this introduces students to the main theoretical approaches within Green Criminology, with particular emphasis on international perspectives and solutions to the climate crisis.
In addition, Dr Lowri Cunnington Wynn introduces concepts of âenvironmental harm,â vs âenvironmental law.â
Green Criminology is central to studentsâ understanding of a changing world, and this session explores the complex dependence between humans, nature, the changing climate and its relationship to harm and crime.
Dr Ian Harris from the Aberystwyth Business School presents Rise of the Machines â How Amazonâs Robot Revolution Destroyed Its Competition .
In July 2020 Jeff Bezosâ net worth topped $200,000,000,000!
Decades earlier he knew that Savings, Selection, and Speed were key to his success.
Bezos recognised that data, automation, and robotics would support these consumer requirements and create lasting competitive advantage and he invested heavily .
Competitors have been decimated, but is his workforce headed for the same fate?
Within the session, there were three interactive polls addressing each of the focal points of the presentation: Selection/Speed/Savings.
The event links to A level/BTEC curriculum areas including: Supply Chain/Supply and Demand/Inventory Management/Markets/Business Structure/Business Finances/Marketing.
Dr Amanda Clare from the Department of Computer Science explores how new technology is digitising biology , discussing its potential and its ethical implications.
We can now automate laboratory experiments, decode and interpret genomes, store large amounts of data and model a wide range of intricate systems from epidemics to the connections of the brain.
The subject areas of biology, computer science and mathematics are being brought together to enable our future .
We ask questions along the way to find out how comfortable we are with the rapid changes weâve seen in what is possible, and what we could expect to see by 2030.
Personalised medicine?
Genetic information read from your mobile phone?
Then we ask: what will we do with all this biological data that weâre gathering, and how will we share it?
We are also very aware that data is not the same as knowledge: how are we going to make sense of it all?
The key topics introduced and discussed are:

Dr Jeff Bridoux from the Department of International Politics explores the future of world order.
The session tackles key themes including power in international politics, United States, China, and global challenges ( climate change, global health, nuclear proliferation, war, globalisation ).
The last ten years have been marked by a gradual shift in power amongst great powers.
More specifically, a relative decline in US power concurrent with the rise of China as an economic and military powerhouse have prompted analysts of international politics to declare that the world is entering a period of power transition.
The world order as we know it is changing.
Alexander Pitchford, Rolf Gohm, and Jukka Kiukas, from the Department of Mathematics at Aberystwyth University, introduce the mathematical principles of quantum computing, and discuss the impact of quantum information science on emerging technologies.
The rapid development of quantum information theory has fundamentally changed the concept of computing.
While conventional computers work on information encoded in bits as two-state (0/1) choices, quantum computers use information units (qubits) with a much larger set of possible states.
The âquantum advantageâ over conventional computers lies exactly on this extension, the mathematical description of which goes beyond the Boolean logic underlying the conventional computation model, requiring a combination of algebraic structures and probability theory.
Currently, major technology companies, including Google and IBM, are investing in quantum computing, with the expectation that it will in the near future become a part of mainstream computing industry.
Consequently, advanced mathematical skills will be an increasingly valuable asset in the job market of this area.
This webinar introduces, in simple terms, the basic mathematical principles needed for understanding how quantum computing utilises the set of available computational states, the two main quantum features being superposition and quantum entanglement.
Current quantum technology applications is also discussed.
The main objective of this session is to discuss how research that scientists carry out now can help tackle the combined challenges of climate change and habitat loss .
The session will outline the dual threats of climate change and habitat loss and allow students to discuss their potential impacts.
The session will then move on to looking at two applied research projects, ECHOES (based in Wales and Ireland) and DGbarcoding (based in Sabah, Borneo).
The overall aim of both projects is to provide data which will help mitigate these future challenges.
We will then discuss the limitations of the research.
The students will benefit from learning how science projects are carried out in real-world scenarios by multi-disciplinary teams.

Each 14 week module includes recorded lectures ( see sample ) from academics and industry experts, along with guided readings, discussion forums and two assignments.
Flexibility is a key benefit of studying with us, not only in terms of the wide module choice and the number you can choose to study, but also of the structure of the modules, that are divided into 3-4 week study blocks rather than strict weekly deadlines.

From the initial start date you have a maximum of five years to fit in as many or as few modules as you wish.
A part-time MSc cannot be completed in less than two years.
If you are undertaking a part-time doctorate you are permitted an additional two years; seven years in total.

At DIS we put the student at the centre of the distance learning process.
We know that as mature students, distance learners often have to juggle their studies with work (employed or volunteering) and family and other commitments, so we try to be as flexible as possible to help you progress and succeed with your studies.
Therefore, our distance learning programmes are designed with âstructured flexibilityâ.
For example, you can take some time out from the course, should temporary circumstances prevent you from studying.
Undergraduate :
Postgraduate :
Our distance learning courses offer Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for both undergraduate and postgraduate learners.
They range from Short Courses and Certificate courses, to professionally accredited Diploma, Degree, and Masterâs programmes.
Each programme comprises a series of âmodulesâ and each module is worth a specified number of credits.
The modules are designed to give you an overview or in-depth understanding of the subject, depending on the level and number of credits.
A module is then broken down into units and includes exercises and examples to enable you to think, apply and test your knowledge as you learn.
Some modules will be core modules, which means that they have to be completed as part of the course.
Others are option modules that you can select from accordingly.
Distance learning (2-5 years registration)
Our flexible, self-paced degree schemes allow you to complete your degree in 2-5 years.
DIS has been offering Distance Learning in this way for over 30 years, seeing thousands of students through to successful completion of a professionally accredited qualification.
They have been designed to fit in with busy working/family lives and allows maximum choice and flexibility, while also offering a clearly structured and supported route to qualification.
It is possible to complete the course within two years.
You normally need to be working in the information sector (libraries, archives, records office, information management) but please get in touch with us if you have any questions about this.
Distance learning (2-year course - for UK Postgraduate Masterâs Loan funded students only)
Our two-year courses are eligible for students in receipt of a UK Postgraduate Masters Student Loan only.
The module content and structure of these courses is identical to the 2-5-year schemes above.
However, the course must be completed within a two-year period in line with the Postgraduate Masters Loan requirements.
At the start of your distance learning studies, our support and guidance will ensure that you know how to study the programme and who to contact for further advice.
We also provide training in how to access and use our online support systems and resources, including our tailored Skills Induction Programme (SkIP).
Our distance learning is delivered through a blend of methods including: online modules, study guides, activities and resources, residential schools and workshops, telephone, MS Teams and/or Skype tutorials, workplace reflection exercises, personal and academic tutor support.
Modules are designed with study guides and a range of activities and resources such as case studies, video & podcast interviews, quizzes, and shared activities such as online discussion groups, with advice and support from the subject expert about the module and its assignments.
We understand that you have to balance your studies with already busy lives and we therefore aim to provide you with as much flexibility as possible, whilst at the same monitoring your progress against specified targets.
Distance learners will follow a recommended study schedule/plan to complete your programme within:
How you manage that time is largely up to you.
As long as you complete the recommended minimum number of credits per year, and any recommended study schedule, you can plan your own study time, including when you submit assignments.
Your personal tutor can help you to plan your studies, and your Programme Team will help you to track your pace of study.
Our distance learning programmes are structured to enable some flexibility within the overall time limits of the programme.
For example, it sometimes happens that students do not make the progress they would wish to and if your studies are affected by particular circumstances, you might be able to Temporarily Withdraw from the course or apply for an extension to your course registration period.
There are no individual assignment deadlines.
You set your own deadlines in line with your personal study timetable, to ensure that you can finish your course on or before your end of registration date.
Minimum pace of progress targets and study planners are also designed to help you with this.
Broadly speaking, a 20 credit module represents 200 hours of study.
In practice, this can vary from module to module for a number of reasons including familiarity with the subject and continuity of study.
All Programmes begin with participation in a 3-4 day study school.
Usually the September study schools are residential at Aberystwyth University and the Spring study schools (March/April) are online.
For more information on Study Schools, see the Study Schools Section .
After a certain number of module credits are completed, there may be further study schools to participate in, and all Programmes offer a dissertation school for those progressing to the dissertation.
All our postgraduate courses have Diploma and Certificate exit points and undergraduate courses have a Diploma exit point.
Students who are self-funding or partially sponsored can pay for their course one module at a time, and these can be purchased from our online shop when you are ready to start them.
For students who are being 100% sponsored by employers, the fees are broken up into annual payments over three years.
Once you are registered as a student, all access to University resources, programme and module resources, and email communications, will be via your Aberystwyth University computer account.

New sentences found on https://aber.ac.uk/en/lifelong-learning/whatislifelonglearning:
Lifelong learning is the ongoing, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for personal or professional development.
It is basically the idea that you never stop learning.
It means that education and learning aren't limited to formal schooling or a specific time in life but extend throughout an individual's life.
A never-ending journey : It's like being a student of life, always curious and ready to learn, no matter how old you get.
Self-driven : You learn because you want to, not just because you have to.
Maybe you're curious, looking for a career change, or want to learn a new form of art or language!
Anywhere and everywhere : Lifelong learning isn't restricted to the classroom, it is also from videos, podcasts, books, or just chatting with someone at a coffee shop.
Stay updated : The world's always changing.
By always learning, you keep up with the latest developments and never feel left out.
Growth : Some people learn for work.
Others maybe to speak a new language, understand a different art form, develop an interest or just to know more about the world.
Not just books : It's not just about hitting the books or getting degrees.
It's about understanding cultures, people, and how things work.
Being your own boss : You decide what you want to learn, making choices that help you grow and make decisions in life.
Question everything : Lifelong learners aren't afraid to ask "why" or "how." They love finding out new perspectives.

New sentences found on https://aber.ac.uk/en/lifelong-learning/employability:
Lifelong Learning provide opportunities and support for all students to develop qualities that equip them to succeed in a national and global employment arena.
It's common for individuals to change careers and work for several employers across different industries throughout their lifetime.
Changing careers can lead to flexible work patterns and better opportunities with increased salaries.
However, to succeed in many industries, you'll need a set of transferable or employability skills.
These skills aren't centred around any career path or industry in particular.
Instead, they are useful in any job.
Employers also search for employees with these skills to work in high-level positions.
What are employability skills?
Employability skills, or transferable skills, are the core skills and traits required to succeed in any job.
They are the soft skills that make you desirable to an organisation regardless of your previous training or professional experience.
Employability skills increase your verbal communication, work readiness and teamwork ability.
Why are employability skills important?
Employability skills are important because, while not often listed in job descriptions, most employers look for them when interviewing applicants.
Having employability skills can help you stand out from other candidates applying for the same position.
It's important to list employability skills that are most relevant to the role to improve your chances of getting hired.
Here are some of the most important employability skills:
Communication, through any medium, is an essential part of work.
You should be able to deliver and understand messages clearly to and from your employer.
This will help you accomplish tasks faster and improve productivity and cooperation with fellow employees.
Excellent communication skills will also help improve your efficiency in the workplace.
Studying Lifelong Learning courses will unconsciously improve your communication skills in terms of writing, speaking, listening and presenting.
Being motivated means having the ability to take action independently and continually progress towards your goals.
Motivated individuals are proactive and rarely allow challenges to keep them from making progress.
Your motivation should fuel your desire to succeed and inspire you to continuously improve your capabilities through learning and professional development opportunities.
Your company will benefit from your initiative and attain a competitive edge in the industry through the innovation you affect.
Teamwork skills enable you to work amicably alongside your colleagues to achieve a common objective.
These skills are essential since they better enable a company to reach its set goals.
Working and learning with others on our Lifelong Learning courses will help you to work as part of a team and teach you how to work on your own initiative.
Reliability means that you are trustworthy and your employer can depend on your word and capabilities.
Trust is earned by consistently completing assigned tasks on time and delivering satisfactory work results.
Our courses are assessed via written assignments which allow you to showcase your learning as well as your dependability and ability to work towards a deadline.
Strong learning skills are essential to quickly understanding concepts and new methods of accomplishing a task, continually improving your skills and effectively adapting to change.
Learning
with us will teach you how to familiarise yourself with the new approaches and methodologies of each course and its content.
Analytical skills are the ability to deconstruct information into processable pieces to draw conclusions.
This often involves using logical reasoning, creativity, research, communication and critical thinking skills.
By studying our Lifelong Learning courses, you will unconsciously learn and use these skills as part of your learning.
Employees who possess these skills can help an organisation solve problems, improve efficiency and increase productivity.
How to use your employability skills
The first step to being able to properly market your employability skills to employers is identifying them.
You should also identify the employability skills employers in your industry are seeking.
When writing your resume, include examples of situations where you've used your employability skills.
It can also be helpful to mention how these skills can help you carry out your new role effectively.

How to apply through UCAS
Before applying through UCAS.com, you will need to register.
You will do this at your school or college and you will need to ask your teacher or career advisor for your username and temporary password and most importantly the buzzword.
If you’re not attending a school or college, don’t worry, you can self-register yourself.
Below are the steps that you need to take when completing the online UCAS application form:
You will have already been told to do your research on the courses and universities that appeal to you.
For some people the list can be long and for others quite limited.
Make sure that you save the course that you like using the heart button on the online UCAS course search.
This will keep all your liked searches in one stored area.
We recommend that you start completing your profile around late June or beginning of July.
This helps you to get the boring part of the application out of the way and it will be ready for you to start applying to universities.
There are five sections that you will need to fill in which are:
Remember, you must save these sections once you have completed them, otherwise the information that you have inputted will be lost and you will have to start again.
Download our Guide to Applying for University for step-by-step information.
This page might appear if you have answered certain questions from the above category.
UCAS doesn’t organise your student finance, but if you need financial support at University (tuition fee loan, maintenance grant/ loan), you can give UCAS permission to share your information with the relevant student finance company.
This helps speed up the process of applying and the awarding of your student finance.
The Personal statement is one of the most important elements of your UCAS application, so to get the best advice, read our dedicated page that will help you to nail the personal statement.

Listen to some of the top tips in our dedicated Personal Statement video hub.

Download our 'how-to' guide on selecting university courses.
Top tips:
It’s so important to check over what you have written and make sure that you’re applying to the right university for the correct course.
It’s an easy mistake to put the wrong course code down or to mix up the University of your choice!

Aberystwyth Egypt Scholarship
Ahmed Shehata
(PhD Information Studies)
"It was my immense luck and fortune to be a part of Aberystwyth University.
Aberystwyth is a lovely place where I spent four years.
I joined the Ph.D.
program in the Information Studies Department, which helped me to boost my career as I worked later as a lecturer in Minia University in Egypt and after that joined Sultan Qaboos University in Oman as an assistant professor in the Information Studies Department.
The best thing about the university is the cooperative staff who helped me during my study and the library where I spent a great time studying and reading.
One more thing I enjoyed is Aberystwyth, the friendly, beautiful and charming town.
During my study, I considered Aberystwyth as my second home, which I am sure I will visit many times in the future.
Studying at Aberystwyth is a great opportunity for everyone I advise students from Egypt and all over the world to enjoy their studies and life in this charming town I am sure you will love it.
If you are planning to study at Aberystwyth, make sure to enjoy your study, make friends, visit the student union, spend more time in the library, and make many memories that you will never forget.
I am currently an Assistant professor at Sultan Qaboos University - Oman."

Aberystwyth Kenya Scholarship
David Tarus
(MSc Environmental Management)
" My MSC degree from Aberystwyth University afforded me the requisite skills and expertise which enabled me to competitively qualify for international roles.
I am currently working as a Seeds2B Project coordinator with AATF.
This is an organization that deals with the deployment of improved agricultural technology in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA).
My role involves managing and coordinating the evaluation and commercialization of improved varieties of several crops in selected countries in SSA.
Before this appointment, I was consulted by the Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) under the auspices of its Biosafety Capacity Building Project for sub-Saharan Africa as an expert and adviser in bio-regulatory issues.
Previous roles at AATF involved coordinating efforts in seed sub-sector policy and regulatory improvement, implementation of policy on the use of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides, and facilitation of regulatory aspects of aflatoxin control in maize and peanuts project in conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) and COMESA.
I also coordinated food safety capacity enhancement efforts involving the private sector, regulators and policymakers, an effort that was implemented in Eastern and Western Africa.
While at Aber, I enjoyed my stay as a student.
The university’s administrative procedures have been tailored to favour students at every level; from registration, academic assistance, library resources to the availability of work-study programs for students who would like to work and earn some extra cash during their spare time.
The most exciting and humbling moment for me was during my dissertation writing.
My MSC supervisor, Dr.
John Scullion, gave me the best that he could, in guiding and timely reviewing my work.
He always reviewed and sent back his comments within 24hrs; an experience I will never forget.
The organization and orderliness of student events and activities were high-notch.
The respect, decorum, and civility exemplified by both the university administration and the student population was amazing.
Aberystwyth University is a place of class, academic excellence and where merit is king.
My accommodation was the best, staying at the seafront, an experience I will never forget.
I graduated having gained the best in my academic pursuit and more importantly having experienced in its highest measure, what a world-class university can offer.
Networks with students from all over the world and sharing the richness of cultural diversity, in what I consider to be an exceptional and extraordinary platform, where I felt as if I was everywhere in the world."

IBERS’ International Distance Learning Scholarship begins to bear fruit (well, cobs!)
A light bulb went off in my head when Dr Phillips told me that each research paper always has a clear overall message.
His words were a game changer.
For the past two years, IBERS has been providing a scholarship to students from the Global South.
The aim of the scholarship is to provide agricultural advisers and influencers with access to the latest thinking in agriculture.
To qualify, students must be working in the agrifood sector either for a state-funded body or an NGO.
One of these students, Seke Kazuru, is a bioinformatics scientist working with researchers in both public and private sector agriculture in Malawi.
Seke says:
My job basically involves working with large amounts of data, processing, analysing, visualizing, and interpreting it for decision makers to make evidence-based decisions.
During the first covid-19 lockdown in Malawi, Seke began to feel that he needed a new challenge.
He has an ongoing interest in using technology to improve crops and decided that studying online would be a way to challenge himself and learn more about this topic whist still being able to meet work and family commitments.
I needed to study at a world class institution while still at my job and looking after my family.
IBERS courses clearly fit this bill, the courses are flexible and convenient.
Seke has done a few MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and so had some idea what it might be like to be a distance learner and the amount of effort required.
His main concern was that it would be a lonely activity, which is always a worry with distance learning.
However, this was not the case.
It was much more interesting than I thought it would be.
The first course I took had several students and I enjoyed the presentations and the forums.
I enjoyed the interactions with the tutors, especially the online meetings and the seminars.
Whilst he found the courses are more intensive than he expected, requiring more commitment to complete than a MOOC, Seke felt that format works very well especially for students from his part of the world.
One of the biggest advantages of these courses is that I directly apply my experience and knowledge to the modules, in doing so it is easy to notice gaps in my knowledge and this encourages me to do more research.
Even for the tasks that I routinely do, I now question myself more and I always want to find out what the current research on a particular topic is about.
Seke has now started the research project for his MRes.
He will be using high tech methods to dissect the genetics and morphological characteristics of some of Malawi’s local maize landraces in the hope of reducing the growth of aflatoxin-producing fungi in the crop.
Aflatoxins are particularly harmful to children causing stunted growth, delayed development, liver damage, and liver cancer.
This research is important as it will inform maize breeders and researchers what to consider in breeding maize varieties to enhance the future health of the population.
IBERS is proud to continue to provide scholarships to students from: Cameroon, Colombia, Malawi, Pakistan, South Africa, Tanzania, Trinidad, Uganda, and Zambia.

Aberystwyth Nigeria Scholarship
Ahmed Ridwan
( MSc Animal Science )
"I enjoyed every bit of my time at Aber, from academics to social interactions.
I can say the best part is the way students were treated both by the teaching staff and the non-teaching staff.
It opened my eye to how student-teacher relationships should be to make it gel.
Also, most of the locals are highly welcoming and willing to offer guidance.
The research experience I gathered for my dissertation at Aber was instrumental in securing a PhD position for myself at the University of Maryland, US.
I'll recommend Aber to everyone any day, anytime.
You can be sure of getting a quality education, building your self-esteem and vision, as well as enjoying a serene environment."
Andrew Banigo
( LLM International Commercial Law )
"The best things for me about the university were how close-knit the community was, the societies and activities that gave ample opportunity to network, discover yourself and learn new things, the beautiful scenery and the rich history of the town, and how this history interwove into the fabric of the community.
If you ever feel too far from home, societies such as the Afro-Caribbean society will ensure that you connect to a community closer to home and find a support system that ensures that you do not have to go through your journey in Aberystwyth alone."
Michael Arowosegbe
( MRes Parasite Control , Commonwealth Shared Scholar)

Dr Jarishma K.
Gokul
(PhD in Microbiology, specializing in Polar Microbiology and Glaciology)
"My time at Aberystwyth University has become the bar to which many of my life and academic experiences are compared.
Whilst there, I was a vital member of a highly collaborative, dynamic, supportive group of colleagues and mentors in IBERS, that continually embraced everything new, different and diverse while accomplishing the extraordinary (and not just because we were microbial ecologists!).
I experienced my first ever snow in Austria thanks to my then supervisor, Dr Arwyn Edwards, and can firmly state that I will never keep my nose out of the ice ever again.
In fact, I continue to work together with him and his excellent team to this day, and anticipate a great continued friendship across the seas.
My PhD from Aber gave me the ideal toolkit to explore microbial life on both the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets and mountain tops, from the deep Antarctic ocean, Japanese seas, and sub-Antarctic Islands, to the water and food we consume and in the land we depend upon to provide the food we need to survive.
My time at Aber left an indelible mark on my being and has aided in my becoming a successful scientist and leader abroad, and an overall virtuous human being.
For the first time in my life I was able to indulge my musical side thanks to the abundance of art representation (and a rather supportive musical Welshman).
I joined two amazing choirs, The University Singers and Abercoustic, to engage in classical and popular music, and was even awarded University colours for my contributions.
It allowed far more engagement the welcoming town folk which was incredible.
There are far too many things I love immensely about Aber - living so close to the sea and the hilltops, prom walks at sunset, “kicking the bar”, lots and lots of little lambs on the green hillsides when visiting Devils Bridge, long walks to Borth with the accompanying Gorse thorn scratches, choir rehearsals in the Old College, trips to Aberaeron for honey ice cream, walking about Nant yr Arian spotting red kites, late summer barbeques and bonfires on the beach with friends.
Living in Aber has had an unbelievable impact on my life, and I still envisage my growing from strength to strength while learning at every step of the way.
I encourage others to embrace the wonderfully different circumstances you find yourself in as a student in Aber.
Prepare, be safe and get that degree… But… Be your real self, travel, learn incredible things, explore, meet remarkable people, learn a bit of Welsh (or more!), grow into the best version of yourself and then grow some more.

Aber is a very green seaside student town with very friendly people.
The crime rate is very low compared to most towns in the world, the transport system was very easy to figure out (with friendly bus drivers might I add).

There is also a mosque for the Muslim brothers and sisters.

During my time in Aber, I was also able to do a short course in Social Psychology.

By Maureen Hamiyanze
Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in my country, Zambia.
I joined Heifer International Zambia in August 2014 as Programme Manager for Luapula Livestock Development Programme.
My main role is providing leadership in the planning, management and implementation of the Luapula Livestock Development Program whose goal is to provide improved livestock species to rural farmers of Luapula Province.
Prior to joining Heifer, I provided leadership for the Zambia Fodder Project Pilot (ZFP) which developed, tested, documented and disseminated ecologically sustainable fodder and fodder seed production for inclusion in farming systems in Zambia.
My quest has always been:
‘How can agriculture contribute more effectively to sustainable development without depleting the natural resource base or creating an imbalance in our fragile ecosystem?’
This quest informed my decision to undertake the MSc in Sustainable and Efficient Food Production in order to enhance my scientific skills and knowledge in sustainable livestock production.
The qualification will not only position me as a key decision maker able to influence agricultural policy, but also enable me to transition into lecturing work.
Further, the course addresses the skills gap that exists in my country and region especially among women who are the key players in the agricultural sector.
The course provides the perfect fit for these career aspirations.
Although balancing work, study and family responsibilities is challenging, Distance Learning is particularly attractive to me as it has granted me an opportunity to study and work at the same time.
Maureen has completed 3 modules (Organic & Low Input Ruminant Production, Grassland Systems and Silage Science).
She is currently studying Business Management for Rural Entrepreneurs and hopes to start her MSc dissertation early next year.

I love the views in Aberystwyth like the Pen Dinas and being able to exercise while enjoying the sight of picturesque houses/villas and breathtaking landmarks like the Castle Ruins.
The University is perfect for students because there are different spots on campus for relaxing, chatting with a friend, or just sitting in silence after a long study session.

Although it can be challenging, I love how my course is spread across two different departments, meaning I can learn different approaches to simple techniques like referencing from different lectures.

Initially, I did find it hard to settle in a new environment far from the typical city life and my family and friends back home.

Don’t worry too much about purchasing a handful of textbooks prior to the start of your course because the library has tons of options (with online access too!) Make sure you have a brief idea of how much you might spend each month.
It can be hard to make friends but don’t be afraid to initiate a conversation on social media prior to attending the university.
Almost everyone is nervous to meet new people too and that’s the beauty of being a student- Undergrad or Postgrad.
Have you joined any clubs or societies here at Aber?
I have joined the Aberystwyth Law Society and Catholic Society.
I love that both societies host amazing socials open to everyone, like the Murder Mystery for Law where people dress up according to a particular theme and get to know each other through teamwork and solving a mystery.
(BSc Computer Science)
"Nature was definitely my favourite thing about living in Aberystwyth.
Taking walks by the sea coast, hiking in the mountains, relaxing and even studying at the beach, watching the starlings by the pier.
Nothing can come close.
At university, I was surrounded by many extremely brilliant students and this alone rubbed off and motivated me to be my best.

My friends and the sunset.
The most fantastic thing in Aberystwyth is the sunset.
The town is at the seaside so there is always a wonderful view by the end of the day.
However, what I really love is all the people I met here and all my friends that I have.
This is what I really love about Aber.
As I am learning two different topics, international politics opened my mind to understanding how the countries work with each other and the climate, how the world works and how it will be in the future because of the climate crisis.
The combined courses can help me understand climate policies and how they shape international politics.
The town is lovely.
I like here because it is small, so everything is near.
Although I am from São Paulo and everything is so far, it is much easier to find here.
The only problem is the cold weather, but I am Brazilian.

BSc Geology .
I spent many years after graduation living and working with Aberystwyth as my base, and it was only in 1997, 13 years after graduating, that I finally left the town for good.
As a student, I remember most those walks back down Penglais Hill, when you could see the cold rain gathering and you just knew you wouldn't make the seafront before the squall hit...
On a serious note, I remember the great atmosphere between students and staff, the slightly sedate pace of life and the chance to use that for the better.
Can't also forget the pubs closing on Sunday (not any more, Ed.) endless fell-walking (again in that rain I mentioned), and that slow train journey back to (for want of a better word) civilization.
After an undergraduate geology degree, I then stayed on for a PhD in geology in North Wales and I was lucky to pick up a substantial volume of consultancy work that helped me into the oil and gas business at a bad time (1985) for the industry.
I built that consultancy into my first business and have run service businesses in the sector ever since.
A great career, as it has taken me all over the world, most notably into Russia (both before and after the fall of the iron curtain), Venezuela, and, for the last 14 years, Brazil.
Indisputably the quality of my education at Aber, and more particularly the mentoring of my supervisors, were critical in getting me on the right road, and with the skill set needed to go forward.
Even now, 27 years on, I still directly make my living based on what I learned at Aber.
Can I say more?
I know that the course I studied no longer exists as such, but the basics stay the same.
Take the studies seriously, and try to build on what you learn, principally because any course is always going to be just an overview which leaves a lot of interesting stuff there still to be found.
Of course, learning doesn't stop at university, but that is by far the best chance you are ever going to get to absorb it.
Aber gives you time to do that.

I love the location of Aberystwyth.
Being from Vancouver Island surrounded by beaches and mountains the coastline allows me to feel like I am back at home.
Being able to swim in the sea or go sit on the beach really provided me a sense of peace and comfort.
The campus is very close to the town so being a short walk away makes everything assessable.
There’s no shortage of restaurants and pubs which can make it easy to plan a night out with friends.
I have most enjoyed being taught by staff who are extremely passionate about their work.
The Interpol department being the first in the world has attracted some brilliant minds to teach us in their speciality field.
It allows me to have engaging and interesting lectures and seminars which results not only in class discussions but also in feeling like I am getting the most out of each session.
I feel supported by not only lecturers but also my personal tutors.
I can reach out to them at any time and get guidance immediately.
I also enjoy how my course is set up, we are given due dates in advance which allows me to do independent study and feel like I’m in control of my learning.
I fortunately didn’t have an issue with adjusting.
I found it was easy to navigate both town and campus after the first couple of weeks.
It is extremely safe here, I have never had any issues which I believe has had a large impact on how I’ve adjusted.
Everybody I have came across in town is extremely friendly and I have never felt like I don’t belong here.
My friends have became my family, I spend holidays with their family which has allowed me to make my own traditions.
Since it is such a small town where ever you are, you will see a familiar face.
If you want a small quiet town surrounded by nature that is only a train ride away from a large city I think Aberystwyth is for you.
I was extremely nervous to move here because it was unknown and new but now I cannot imagine my life without Aberystwyth.
Since it is such a small town with very friendly people I found myself quickly referring to it as ‘home’ while being away.
The coursework can be stressful but there are multiple outlets to get support and creating a routine to keep yourself active is not difficult at all.
What is your favourite thing about campus?
It’s a very pretty campus with lots of green space and views of the sea.
My favourite part is being able to see animals such as the cats that roam around who always will stop for pets.
I feel safe walking alone on campus because there are lots of lights.
I also like that it’s not a huge campus, it’s very walkable and I don’t feel rushed between classes which eliminates a cause of stress.
There’s loads of places to get coffee or food between lectures or just to meet up with friends.

Kyra Rhoades
(BSc Wildlife Conservation)
I love the small coastal town vibes with green grass and a sea breeze all year round.
The campus is lovely with some stunning views of the town and ocean.
I love that the modules are challenging yet fulfilling.
The balance of lectures to coursework is relatively easy on my mental health compared to the States and my professors are always helpful and eager to listen.
I was surprised at how seamless the transition was for me.
The town is simple to navigate and advice was just a text or phone call away.
I befriended my flatmates and fellow international students really quickly so I never felt alone.
If you enjoy the quaint sea village and a smaller university vibe, I think Aber would be the place for you.
The classes are relatively intimate making it a more personal learning experience - especially for less popular courses like mine.
If you’re a party animal, just be warned that while Aber does have a pretty good time, there are only a couple of club-like venues.
So far I've joined the conservation society where we do a Wednesday and Saturday thing each week.
I haven't been able to go on many due to classes and limited spots the mini bus but I did have an amazing time working with butterflies and helping them move plants in preparation for winter.
Almost all societies do a bar-hopping social which is lots of fun as well!
Ruby Fitzer
(BA English LIterature and Media)
Aberystwyth is such an amazing and welcoming place!
When I first moved here everyone that I met was so helpful and just really kind.
I had a ton of questions when I came to the university and everyone from my housemates to university staff was extremely responsive and willing to jump in and help.
The town also is small enough that I feel familiar with it but large enough that there’s usually things to do.
There’s a really fun nightlife and watching the sunset at the beach is a weekly occurrence for me.
It’s been such an amazing experience to be here!
What I’ve enjoyed most about my course is the interactions I’ve had with my lecturers and the other students.
Before coming to Aberystwyth I was in nursing school so I was so nervous that the switch to a more creative and writing based course would be really difficult, especially since I hadn’t done any writing in a really long time.
When I came to my first lectures and started turning in papers and doing group work, all of the constructive criticism I got from staff and students was amazing and I ended up doing really well my first semester.
There’s also a pretty big variety of modules to choose from so I’m able to pick things that sound really interesting to me and avoid things that I don’t think I would enjoy.
Adjusting was not the easiest thing in the world but I was extremely lucky to have housemates that I became friends with right away and I joined societies pretty early on so I had a lot of ways to make friends.
I was very homesick at the beginning but I was able to facetime my family and friends from home and I lean on my group of friends here quite a bit.
There are also quite a few international students here so knowing I’m not the only one trying to adjust to life in a new country is really helpful.
If you’re considering studying at Aberystwyth, I would highly recommend taking your time to learn about the University, really dive into the information provided about your course, and then just do it!
It ended up taking me about a year to do everything from start to finish when it came to my application, visas, saving money, etc and it was so worth all of that time and effort.
I love it here and I would highly recommend it to anyone!
I’m currently in Cocktail Society and in the Aber Uni Women’s Basketball Club.
I absolutely love Cocktail Society and it’s actually helped me to get familiar with the town since most of the socials are in town.
It was also the first society I joined and it was extremely welcoming and most of my friends that I have now are people I’ve met through that society.
I also have loved being on the basketball team and I’ve even joined the basketball committee as the social secretary.
The team has given me an opportunity to travel around the UK a little bit for matches and has given me some of my closest friends.
Having a leadership role on the committee is also really fun!
I had never played basketball before I moved here and the girls on the team are so helpful and encouraging.
BSc Geography
For me, Aberystwyth was a fresh start at an uncertain point in my life.
The University was willing to accept my unconventional hodgepodge of academic qualifications, and throughout my time in Aber, the tutors and lecturers were accessible and truly passionate about their subjects.
They offered sincere praise and fair critique, which helped me to grow as a student and writer.
I learned to read critically, and to interpret materials using perspectives I might not have otherwise considered; a skill that has proven valuable in both my career and day-to-day life.
Aberystwyth is a safe, welcoming, wonderful town all on its own, with a vibrant, surprisingly cosmopolitan culture for such a small place, but it's the friends I made there that made it feel like home.
Days and nights spent exploring the coastline, building beach bonfires, chatting in the pubs, and studying for exams with my friends are some of my most cherished memories.
My degree and the skills I honed while at Aberystwyth have made my career possible.
The highly focused nature of a U.K.
degree means I was able to spend 3 years building meaningful skills in my field rather than wasting time on "core classes." U.S.
employers have done double-takes seeing "Aberystwyth University" on my CV, but many of them recognise the value of an employee who has spent time in a different culture.
For U.S.
students considering Aberystwyth, it's certainly different from the typical American university experience.
Arrive with an open mind and don't be afraid to join societies, engage with your course mates, and try new things.
You'll find your niche and, after graduation, you might never want to leave.
As with all the most enjoyable experiences in life, the thing that stands out most for me are the friendships that I formed while at Aber.
Most of these were through my participation in sports, in my case - football.
Finding out that I had so much in common with people from such varied backgrounds was a real learning experience for me and helped to broaden my horizons tremendously.
It probably provided me with a level of comfort that helped me to be willing to accept new opportunities and to be mobile.
From growing up in a small town in Yorkshire I went on to work in London, travel extensively in Europe and the Middle East and, ultimately, to emigrate to New York.
Nobody was more surprised than me that, after graduating with a degree in Geography (and a Masters Degree in Hydrology), I found myself working in banking!
I probably had a fraction of the career knowledge and ambition that the average undergraduate student is armed with nowadays but, fortunately, I found that I loved the profession that I had somehow stumbled into.
After a number of years working in international banking I took an opportunity to move into private banking.
I now manage the New York and New England private banking business for a major U.S.
bank.
I love the business; it's fast paced, always changing and our clients are so varied that every day brings something different.
It certainly may not be obvious as to exactly how my degree helped me in my career, but I found my background in science to be a great learning experience for me.
It gave me discipline, a grounding in research and fact finding and a belief in analysis which has proved invaluable.
BA History
Like all other foreign students at virtually any university, there is that "oh my gosh, how did I get here?" reaction, no matter how much one has planned in the future, but that first step on Aberystwyth soil remains in one's mind as a dream.
The reader has to remember that my arrival was in 1963, long before any sort of internet, so my total amount of knowledge, aside from the university information sent to me, was from my professor who thought highly of Aberystwyth and its courses of study in my field of interest, and 'oh by the way, it does have the nicest weather of all of the UK.' The students, of course, that is what I remember best, the lasting friendships.
Fighting my way down Penglais Hill in gale force rain, headed for the main building and knowing that after classes, coffee at the Penguin Cafe.
Prince Phillip's visit to Rendel and his amazing answer to the students' complaint that there was no on-campus pub.
But it is the people, the occasional gamanfa ganu, the kicking of the bar at the end of the Prom.
No matter what your course of study, whether it is medieval history or chemistry or agricultural studies, or whatever, do it because you find it fascinating, fascinating for you yourself, challenging, and fun.
Sure, it's harder than indescribably hard from time to time, but the fascination and interest must be there.
Do it for yourself.
Embrace it.
Don't do it for others.
Do it because you want to!
We all agree that some fields of study are more likely to be instant job getters, but one also has to have that belief that a good deal of what studying is about is in the discipline, the stick-to-it-iveness, and the intellectual curiosity that leads one on!
BA International Law and Relations
Aberystwyth has a wonderfully diverse and intellectually curious student population.
The teaching faculty were top-notch and truly interested in advancing the education of the students.
I loved the traditions of the University, its cultural identity, and, in particular, I enjoyed walking the Promenade and "kicking the bar."
I am a practising attorney in California.
I am also a licensed certified public accountant.
My areas of emphasis are estate planning, tax and corporate law.
My Aberystwyth degree helped me especially in expanding my world-view and becoming more aware of the political and economic events that shaped the European Union and its tremendous impact in the global arena.
The knowledge that I gained has made me a more interesting person, better able to communicate with a wide range of clients who come from varying backgrounds.

( Law, LLB )
My favorite thing about Aberystwyth is that it is intertwined with nature and attracts students to study more effectively.
In addition, having a friendly and professional staff makes it easier to solve the more stressful problems.
As someone, who loves books, the most important thing for me is that any book is available both online and physically.
Aberystwyth University not only provides the resources, but also facilitates discussions with professors on topics of interest to us throughout the course.
As an introvert, I can say that this place is ideal for me because slow living is the main part of town.
Prospective students should get acquainted with the staff and ask for help if they have problems.
Most importantly, they need to find out in advance how suitable the university can be for their future.
The fact that the roads are surrounded by trees gives me positive energy when I go to university.
This shows that campus life includes both various facilities and harmony with nature.

"The best thing about Aberystwyth University is its student body.
I've made lifelong friends during my time studying in Aber, and the lovely seaside town is handily connected to the Midlands, however, properly distant from the hustles from big cities - a perfect spot for people to bond with each other regardless of distinct cultural backgrounds, departmental specialisations and professional ambitions.
As an international student, the experience in Aber has helped me to establish a true connection to the UK and gain unique experience and knowledge of Wales and the West Midlands (which is uncommon for Asian students as most complete their studies in England).
Both have become crucial factors that helped set me apart in my later career development – I now work in commercial banking.
If you're also an international student about to start your life chapter in Aberystwyth University, you will be totally taken very good care of at Aber, and my only advice to you would be: dream big from your Welsh hometown!"
Ray Wang
(MSc Management and Finance)
"Aberystwyth is one of the best towns in the world, the scenery there is very beautiful, you could see the sunlight and hike along the coast on a sunny day.
Seafood is very cheap, you could buy crabs and lobsters from the fisherman directly.
People there are very nice, they always smile at you, they are willing to help you when you need it.
Aberystwyth is a peaceful town, it’s easier for students to concentrate on study.
All Professors are patient and humorous, although studying is very hard, you will be very happy and enjoy your time there.
They are the best and most unforgettable memories in my life.
I am now working at Hongzhou technology in China, Beijing."
Liping Wang
(PhD Computer Science)
"The years of living in Aberystwyth are the best time of my life and Aberystwyth is my favourite place in the world.
During my PhD study I received professional training in doing research which will benefit my entire career.
I was also benefited from various training courses and workshops provided by the university.
Currently I work as a lecturer at Shandong Normal University in China.
Those years of life in Aberystwyth brings me lots of wonderful memories.
It is safe and convenient to live in the town.
I really miss the beautiful sceneries and the kind local people.
If you enjoy the peaceful life and would like to dedicate yourself to the study, Aberystwyth University can absolutely be your choice.
Try your best blending into the university and local life and it will be an unforgettable and valuable experience in your life."

"I am currently at a big company which is called Fosun group, it invests in many fields like real estate, medicines, culture-oriented travel, new energy power, steel, mining, etc.
And I am in charge of planning as a whole for all departments, in case of floating capital chain breakage, therefore I always have to coordinate all capital properly.
Currently my title is Senior Account Manager.
When I studied at Aber, the courses were well organised and all students are likely to discuss with each other the content of the course.
The lecturers were always giving good examples to help us understand well, therefore I think the education at Aber was the best I had ever experienced.
My favourite thing about living in Aber was there were so many attractions around this city, such as the middle age's castle and a small train to the peak of the mountain where the beach was at the foot, we visited on the weekend and after an important exam, those were all good memories.
In fact, the degree I achieved in Aber was very important to my career, especially the knowledge I learned in the lectures and seminars, such as financial data analysis, marketing, macro and micro market analysis and etc, because my work for now is all involved in finance-related knowledge.

At last, I would like to give advice for Chinese students is trying to relax and do not worry about your study particularly studying at Aber uni, of course it has a beautiful beach and sunset, you should be enjoying this fine view and learning what you have to learn every day, do not panic, do not think more about your further career, just study and enjoy your current time."

( BSc Veterinary Biosciences & MRes Parasite Control )
I love the environment and atmosphere Aberystwyth provides the best, especially during summer, it feels like you’re in a completely different place!
I have been incredibly lucky that I had very supportive and encouraging tutors during my courses, and the connections I made with my lecturers made me enjoy the courses a lot more and overcome my shyness when it came to asking questions about the materials taught.
At first, I was feeling homesick being so far away from home.
But making a lot of friends through my classes and extracurricular activities helped me feel more comfortable and at ease at Aberystwyth.
Take any opportunity you can get, sometimes you have no idea what you would be missing out on if you don’t take the initiative!
During my bachelors, I decided to restart the Animal and Veterinary Society with a few of my friends and have been on the committee ever since, I’m also an active member of the Showdance sports club since my first year at University.
My favourite thing about joining a society or a club is having the opportunity to socialise with people at university who are in different years and doing different degrees, it’s such a great way to make friends with common interests as well!
Linus Hui Kai Hei
(BSc Tourism Management)
"With a spectacular seaside view and cosy atmosphere, Aberystwyth is one of the best environments in the UK to keep you focused on your study.
Studying at Aberystwyth University is one of the best times in my life, where I had the chance to excel in my academics while having met with my life-long friends.
Big thanks to my tutor Carl, who had guided me, besides my study, on independent and critical thinking during the three years of study, which is beneficial for a lifetime and improves my career in the insurance industry.
For those of you who are about to pursue your study at Aber, I'd suggest you get yourself ready to start your wonderful university time in a frosty town!
Do make sure you can cook homestyle dishes to treat yourself when you miss home!
I'm c urrently working in a Ship Management Company as an Insurance Executive."

I love the atmosphere and people here.
Aberystwyth is small and a student town so people in Aber are friendly to students!

Going outside and trying new things is important.
In my first semester, I explored the town and tried new things such as going on a night out, hiking mountains, watching the sunset, eating out at a café.
These experiences bring me to find out what I like, what I don't like, what makes me more comfortable.
Enjoy your new life and this moment!

Yuko Nakauchi
(BA Welsh and Theatre & TV Studies)
Beautiful scenery and people.
Aberystwyth was very different from where I came from.
I grew up in the centre of Tokyo where people hardly know their neighbours, so I instantly fell in love with the friendly atmosphere in the town.
I felt people were so close to each other - I would always be bumping into someone I knew and start chatting on the street or on the campus, which does not happen very often in Tokyo.
I felt very comfortable and secure in Aber and never felt homesick.
I did a joint course in Welsh and Film & TV Studies and took both courses through the medium of Welsh.
Since I returned to Japan I have worked for S4C and BBC Wales as a fixer and translator.
I am also a radio presenter in Japan.
As I am the only Welsh speaker in Japanese media, I have been given opportunities to interview great Welsh artists such as Super Furry Animals, Katherine Jenkins and Duffy.
I am so grateful that my degree at Aber gave me such unique experience and skills and I am proud that what I'm doing now is very much related to what I studied there.
I have also been appointed as the Education UK Ambassador by the British Council (Japan) after winning a UK Alumni Talent Contest to find alumni in Japan who best demonstrate the value of a UK education through their skills.
Aberystwyth is a great place to focus on your studies and build close friendships.
Focus on what you like and pursue it - you may find something more that interests you.
Remember lecturers and university staff are always ready to help you.
Enjoy your Aber life!

Aberystwyth Mongolia Scholarship
Luke Johnston
(BA English Literature)
"During my time at Aberystwyth University, the English Department was superb; the lecturers maintained your interest in the subject through their own obvious passion, as evidenced by the fact that they were conducting research projects and at the top of their field.
The admin team and the library staff were also extremely helpful, particularly when I was feeling stressed over essays.
Furthermore, in my first year, I lived in the Penbryn residence and the catered food was to a good standard – the breakfast is still something I talk about with joy and sometimes miss.
Aberystwyth is a great location with access to beautiful nature and, of course, the beach.
The nightlife was fantastic with a vast array of pubs and bars where you were guaranteed to meet someone you knew at some point on a night out and, partly due to student nights in various places around town, was relatively cheap for both food and drink.
This meant that the whole town had a friendly atmosphere at all times and it constantly felt like you were at home.
In terms of my degree, without it I would not have been invited to interview for a teaching assistant position, which eventually led to the school paying for my teacher training.
Therefore, I am teaching English as a Head of Department in Mongolia today because of the degree I chose and the faculty who helped me to fulfil my potential in the subject – it almost feels like fate!
For anyone thinking about going to Aberystwyth, I would highly recommend it as a safe, friendly and welcoming place where you will instantly feel at home – my decision to go there was based on the warmth I felt during the open day from the guides and staff and that feeling never left me.
I can think of no better place to develop as a young person with aspirations and am genuinely thankful for what the town and university of Aberystwyth has given me."

During my master’s year, I was offered PhD funding and stayed for three more years before joining the Belgian diplomatic service in 2015.
Finishing my PhD while working as a diplomat (and mum to a newborn!) was tough, but the support of my supervisors and the department made all the difference.

It is hard to pinpoint one particular thing that I love about Aberystwyth, I believe it is a sum of the wonderful teaching experience that student gets here and the tight community that is Aberystwyth.

I have completed a bachelor’s in law (LLB) in Aberystwyth and I have returned for my Ph.D.
Both courses are very different thus I want to discuss them separately.
With regards to LLB, I must admit that students get all the support they may need.
The lectures are extremely friendly and always ready to help and one is always encouraged to ask questions.
In addition, there are many elective modules that vary from international law to sports law and one can really find their specific interest in law.
Furthermore, there are law-specific societies such as law society and mooting society where students can get involved.
With regards to Ph.D., as it is more of individual research, students are assigned a supervisor who is always ready to help and advise which is extremely useful as it is a very large research project and one could feel lost at first yet supervisors and other faculty members are always ready to help.
Furthermore, there is a graduate school that provides us with additional research training and a large variety of courses to help us not only with research but our future careers as well.
Of course, everyone has their own experience but, in my case, I found adjusting to life in Aberystwyth not that hard, I easily made friends for life.
I have met people from across the globe and had many wonderful life experiences.
I would recommend joining societies and socializing as much as possible, as it is a wonderful way to make new friends and have different life experiences.

Although currently practicing in a Greek civil law legal system, studying Law at Aberystwyth University helped me adopt the proper process required to analyse legal issues and taught me the basic principles of the legal profession.
The professors, lecturers and tutors of the Law Department were always supportive to the law students and open to discussions with them.
After my degree in Aber, I did my Masters in London (UCL), where I used all the knowledge and experience obtained during my bachelor's degree in Aber.
The successful practice of the legal profession depends on the strong foundations the law student acquires during his/her studies and the Law Department of Aber is successfully orientated towards this goal of providing one with that strong background of legal knowledge, a background which accompanies one throughout one's career.

I was part of the women's first hockey team, and played in BUC's and varsity.

Super Teams is something you have to experience!!!
Veterinary Biosciences has opened the world of Animals science and Veterinary science to me.

Sunny days are amazing and the landscapes are breath-taking."
Massimo Marletto
MSc (Econ) International Management
Aber was for me a peaceful, lively, international university town by an often stormy sea, surrounded by relaxing but steep green hills: a sort of landlocked paradise logistically difficult to reach, emotionally difficult to leave.
With a landscape similar to the Italian region I came from (Liguria), I felt at home at first sight: Moneglia-Aberystwyth, more than one thousand miles from one friendly place to another!
I have so many nice memories ...
first of all the people I met there, from the students from all around the world to the university staff, always very friendly and helpful.
Secondly, the atmosphere of the town: romantic, mysterious, cultivated, proud and brave (you need to be brave to live at the mouth of a "winding" river!).
Thirdly ...
well, the nice walks at Tanybwlch beach, the Sunday market - Car boot sale on Clarach Bay beach, the trips to Mwnt (what a nice place) and Aberaeron, the warm university flat in Waunfawr, the musical "The Sound of Music" at the Arts centre, some friends who came to visit me (and who did not manage to open the entrance door of the seafront hotel they were staying due to the strong wind), the smile of one of the library wardens, a crow with a broken wing which I was feeding regularly ...
very simple things which in Aber, where possibly time seems to go slower, you manage to appreciate to the full!
While in Aber I was a constant visitor to the Careers Office: it was there that I found a job vacancy for a junior research analyst position for an international organisation in the sugar sector based in Paris.
With the help of the Careers advisors, I applied and, well, got the job!
I spent eight years in Paris, so I could say that Aberystwyth brought me to Paris and that ...
yes, there is life after Aberystwyth!!
After Paris I worked as a consultant in the agri-food sector for an NGO in Brussels and for a research company in Bologna (Italy).
It was then time for me to try a change of career and I went into tourism marketing: I worked for a Congress Centre in Genoa (Italy) and for a Leisure Company in Lorca (Spain).
Now, besides freelance consultancy, I am establishing my own business in the wine and clothing sectors.
So, how has the Aber degree helped?
I had already a degree in Political Science from an Italian university and getting an MSc (Econ) in International management at Aber gave me a more complete and higher profile to enter the international job market.

When I first came to Aberystwyth I was worried there would be a language barrier where I wouldn’t be able to get my point across.
However, I quickly realised everyone around me (flatmates, lecturers, classmates and even the wider community) was willing to make me feel welcomed and understood
My honest advice would be to go for it!
It is an awesome experience that you are not likely to get in many other universities, thanks to the size of the uni making friends is easy and you get to know your lectures by name which makes it that much easier and enjoyable.

The rest of my time in Aberystwyth I joined the ACV (Conservation Volunteers), despite COVID disrupting a lot of the activities the society had planned I still got to enjoy beach cleans, dolphin watching, movie and game nights, etc..
and got to meet friendly and like-minded people who cared about how we treat the Earth and the things living in it.

Carl Danielsson
BSc/Econ International Relations
My very first impression of Aber is likely the beautiful landscape and the hills surrounding Cardigan Bay.
And the rather unpretentious train fare from Birmingham to Aber.
An observation, which persisted throughout my studies, was the frequent rainfall.
But this did in no way interfere or reduce my experience of Aber as a colorful, bustling and energetic town.
I also recall the student society.
It was more than I could wish for.
Aber is a small town with a significant student population consisting of a large and active international student community.
Seeing as Aber is far away from larger settlements, it means few students head home during weekends.
Everyone stays put and that helps creating a special community.
It is really easy to meet people and start new friendships and relationships in Aber.
Its still, after some 15 years, very close to my heart.
After graduating from Aber I went on to do a Masters degree at St.
Andrews.
Currently I am working as a senior adviser in international development cooperation at the Swedish Board of Agriculture.
In my position I am responsible for identifying, setting up and carrying out capacity-building projects in the area of public administration reform.
My work allows me to travel and work in many low-income countries.
My degree in international relations has helped me tremendously to perform well in an international multi-cultural environment.
Particularly the critical theories and political philosophy in general has equipped me with a mindset that allows me to quickly understand “systems” and their subordinated components on a theoretical as well as practical level.
Several “wisdoms” from Aber that I may have questioned at the time, is unconsciously guiding much of my work today.
Particularly my ability to take on a critical approach to assignments and existing structures and processes based on a fairly thorough understanding of theoretical systemic constructs.

I always wanted to study a degree in the UK because I had this firm belief that Britain offered top quality education in the world.
When I decided to study at Aberystwyth, I knew that the University was old, rooted in tradition and excelled in Politics and Security.
Interpol had some of the finest academics and experts in their fields at the time and it was such a privilege to study under their supervision.
The University has contributed so very much to my intellectual and personal development.
I did spend an utterly fantastic year at Aber, met so many wonderful people, made so many good friends and learnt so much.
Even though the town was a bit isolated, I never had a dull moment thanks to the hospitality of the University and the local Welsh people.
I do miss my long snowy winter days, walks in the countryside, great lectures in the legendary Old College, local pubs, boys’ night outs with my housemates and help from the ghost of Sir Ellis Griffiths in the exams.

The best things about the University
The University is surrounded by nature and I call the nature element as “Therapy for Study” because it indeed is!
That was the very first impression and still is until this very moment.
Other best things that I personally feel and experienced is being able to meet and make friends with a lot of other students from many countries.
It is exciting to hear not only different accents but also different cultures that we learn from each other here.
Also, I truly appreciate the facilities the Uni offers such as the Sports Centre for numerous sports activities like gym, wall climbing, swimming, football and more.
Favourite thing about living in Aberystwyth
The locals are very friendly and warm.
Also, the town is clean, well-organised and beautiful.
Aberystwyth has a nice seafront for a walk, running, having hot drinks at the cafes and watching the sunset whilst looking at and listening to the seagulls.

Bachelor Degree (4 year) 75% from:
Aberystwyth Philippines Scholarship
Jazmin completed her PhD at Aber's department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies in March 2010.
In addition to her successful academic and creative career, Jazmin acts as Aber's unofficial ambassador in the Philippines and is willing to help any Aber alumnus visiting or working in that country.
The place is beautiful and very conducive to study and thinking and reading.
I remember the silence and the sound of the waves close to where I lived on the seafront.
I remember the isolation of Aber, how it took so long to get there or to travel to the big cities; I have strong memories of traveling on the train or bus and seeing the poster-perfect countryside; this was what I wanted at the outset - I did not want to be in London or another big city, and the distance certainly did not prevent me from traveling to conferences elsewhere in the UK or other parts of the world.
Most of all I remember the people: the friendly locals manning the shops in town and the ever helpful staff of the university.
I made friends with staff and other students, some of whom became almost like family to me.
Also, I will never forget that my supervisor and the university student support office helped me with my flight expenses for an emergency trip going home in time to attend my father's funeral.
I am an Associate Professor of drama, theatre, and performance and serving as Chair of the Department of Literature at De La Salle University-Manila in the Philippines.
Outside of my main job, I am part of an arts network in the country in the fields of theatre and performance and literary arts.
I served as Chair of the National Committee on Dramatic Arts of the [Philippine] National Commission for Culture and the Arts for 2013-2016.
I also continue to be active internationally.
I currently serve in the Board of Directors of Performance Studies international (PSi) as its Membership Officer.
My Aberystwyth degree has helped a lot, especially because I worked with the best supervisory team one could wish for and because my department (Theatre, Film and Television Studies) is very well placed in my field, with many members of staff who work internationally.
Participate.
Get involved.
Make friends.
Know what the university has to offer and make the most of them for your study and also for your personal and career development.
Set your goal, stay focused, but also do not forget to enjoy your stay in Aber.
There is a vibrant arts community with various events going on all the time.
Also, explore the area, take walks, visit nearby villages and towns.
But, also, build your network in and outside of the university.
Go to conferences.
Present your work.
Publish.
Most important of all, don't be afraid to explore or test new ideas.
I certainly wish I could have done all these or more myself when I was a student.

I remember the stunning journey across mid-Wales to start each term, Aber's dramatic geography and the weather!

I am active in the Singapore start-up scene, as a Mentor and Entrepreneur, where I develop businesses around Human Resources and the related Technologies, such as the GatewaySingapore.com family of websites.
Previously, I was a Managing Director in HR, Technology & Operations at Deutsche Bank, in Singapore.
Thanks to the Careers Service I discovered voluntary work while studying at Aber and, after I left, I continued while I worked out what to do.
Since 1992 I have lived in Asia and taken regional and global roles across HR, IT and Operations.
History gave me an awareness of different cultures and the appreciation that we all think differently, which has helped managing across cultures.
I appreciate the basic training in intellectual rigour and the ability to form and express my own judgment from diverse material.
I value the critical thinking skills to deconstruct points of view, and test for cause and effect.
Managing change is a large part of what I do; and History is a rich stock of Change Management archetypes showing what can go wrong and how change has been documented, championed and derailed.
Follow your passion, experiment with different points of view and take risks.
You will not see this opportunity again, so live all aspects of it 100% - adventure off the reading list; seek out people who have nothing in common with you; take a deep breath and express your own ideas.
The more that you listen and read, the more you will understand yourself.

Students living in Aberystwyth are required to register with a local GP (family doctor) practice of their choice as soon as they have their new Aberystwyth address.
This is vitally important to ensure continuity of care, especially if you are in receipt of any prescription medicine or other treatment.
If you are registered with a GP in Wales you are entitled to free prescriptions from a pharmacist in Wales.
If you have a complex medical history, please ensure that you bring sufficient medication when you arrive and also bring your repeat prescription form or medication report from your current GP.
This will avoid delays and ensure continuity of care.
If you haven't already done so, please register with an Aberystwyth GP Practice by choosing one of the links below:
Please use your Aberystwyth address when registering.
UK students should bring their National Health Medical cards with them.
It will be helpful, but not essential, for students who have an NHS number (i.e.
UK students or non UK students who have previously registered with a GP) to have it available when they register with a GP.
Returning students should notify their GP of any address changes and re-register if their GP Registration has lapsed.
The three town practices offer the e-Consult facility.
eConsult enables NHS based GP practices to offer online consultations to their patients.
This allows patients to submit their symptoms or requests to their own GP electronically and offers around the clock NHS self-help information, signposting to services, and a symptom checker.
Pharmacies in Wales are now part of the common ailment scheme.
The pharmacy common ailment service is a scheme whereby your pharmacist can provide free confidential advice and treatment (26 common ailments) without you having to make an appointment to see your GP.
If you feel you need to see a GP, patients are asked to ring the practice and they will be signposted to the most appropriate treatment.
EEA/Swiss students who started their courses before 31 December 2020, will continue to be eligible for free NHS services for the duration of their courses.
You should however obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from your home country before coming to the UK to show you are eligible for free health treatment.

If you have paid the Immigration Health Surcharge then you will qualify for free NHS treatment on the same basis as anyone who is ordinarily resident in the UK.
EEA students are advised to apply for an EHIC card from their home countries, before travelling to the UK, as this may entitle you to apply for a full or partial refund of the Immigration Health Surcharge .
International students , including EEA and Swiss nationals, who are coming to study for less than six months and have not paid an Immigration Health Surcharge are advised to take out private medical insurance for the duration of their visit to the UK.
Family members of students who are not travelling to the UK on a dependant type visa will also need to take private medical insurance for the duration of their visit to the UK, as they may not be eligible for free NHS treatment.
Over recent years there has been an increase in the number of cases of certain contagious diseases among students.
To protect yourself and others Public Health Wales recommends that you are up to date with the following routine vaccinations, preferably before arrival: meningitis (MenACWY), MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), diphtheria, polio, tetanus, Human Papillomavirus vaccine (HPV).
NHS Press Release -Students - Is vaccination on your to do list?
Students from countries with a high incidence of TB should be vaccinated against TB.
Find out which countries have a high rate of TB .
Being up to date with all vaccinations is important for all of us, but even more so for students starting university and college who will be meeting, mixing and living with lots of new people.
Universities can be hot spots for measles, mumps, meningitis and sepsis as well as flu and COVID-19 as they present the perfect opportunity for infections to spread.
Some students who start university for the first time this autumn will have missed routine vaccines earlier in life that protect them against potentially fatal conditions.â¯
Before leaving for Aberystwyth, check you are up to date with vaccinations.
It’s important you do this even if you’ve already started your course.
You can check with your GP surgery if you are up to date with your vaccines.
You should have received the following vaccines up to the age of 16 as part of the routine vaccination programme: • two doses of MMR vaccine • one dose of MenACWY vaccine (available up to your 25th birthday) • five doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and polio containing vaccine • two doses of HPV vaccine
Males (born after 01/09/2006) and females can have the HPV vaccine until they reach their 25th birthday.
Men who have sex with men (MSM) can have the HPV vaccine up to 45 years of age at a sexual health service.
Also don’t forget to arrange to have the following vaccines: • an autumn booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine (for those in groups at higher risk from COVID-19) • an autumn Flu vaccine (for those in groups at higher risk from flu)
Also, it’s good to know: • the signs and symptoms of meningitis and sepsis • how to seek medical advice
Once you get to university you should: • Register with a GP as soon as you can – don’t wait until you have a problem.
• Arrange with your GP to catch up on any vaccines you have missed or are due.
Visit the Public Health Wales website for information
If you have a chronic health condition please ensure you bring a month’s supply of up to date medication with you and consider how you will store your medication and dispose of equipment (such as epi pens) safely.

New sentences found on https://aber.ac.uk/en/studentservices/trustedcontactguidance:
A Trusted Contact is a person that an Aberystwyth University student nominates to be someone who can be contacted when there may be serious concerns about their safety and/or wellbeing.
It is likely that most students will choose for their Trusted Contact to be a parent, carer, or a member of their family.
A Trusted Contact can though be someone else if they are over the age of 18 and agree to act in this capacity.
A Trusted Contact should not normally be another Aberystwyth University student or staff member, unless they are also the parent/guardian/partner/close family member.
It is for our students to decide who their Trusted Contact is, but we do encourage that the person chosen is someone who they trust and who they are comfortable asking for help and support.
At Aberystwyth University, we are a community that cares.
We are committed to doing all that we can to support our students, which includes working in partnership with them and, where it is appropriate, members of their support network.
To help us achieve this, we ask that all students provide us with the contact details for their Emergency and Trusted Contacts should it be necessary to contact them for their help and support.
The transition into and through university can be exciting.
It can though at times be challenging.
Our students when arriving may have a support network, be that family, friends and/or other supporters.
It can as such be helpful for our student if a Trusted contact and, when necessary, other members of their support network be there to offer support and reassurance.
We will ask you when registering each year to provide the contact details for your Trusted Contact.
New students will do this when they also provide emergency contact details, details of their GP/Doctor etc.
For returning students it is a case of reviewing and deciding whether you are happy with the current Trusted Contact or whether you would like to make a change to the details.
You can update these details at any point, and you can expect to receive notifications through the academic year to remind you to check your personal details to make sure that they are up to date.
We ask that all students make sure that they have the permission of their Trusted Contact before they add or update their student record.
We would encourage you to share a link to these webpages in order that your Trusted Contact knows what the role entails and when we would consider making contact.
If a student has chosen you as their Trusted Contact, then it is because they trust you and would like you to be the person who the University contacts should there be any serious concerns about their safety and/or wellbeing.
As a university, contact with Trusted Contacts will be infrequent, and wherever possible we will try to involve our students in any decisions when we are considering contacting their Trusted Contact.
If you have any concerns about a student’s wellbeing and/or safety, then do not hesitate in contacting the University.
You can contact the University’s Security team 24/7 by calling 01970 622 649.
If it is not an urgent matter, then please feel free to contact our Student Services team – you can do so by emailing studentwellbeing@aber.ac.uk or by calling 01970 621 761
We will not normally make contact with a student’s Trusted Contact without their consent.
The Trusted Contact we use will be the person most recently identified by the student in their student record, and who remains the named Trusted Contact at the time the support is needed.
If we are to contact this person, we will normally discuss this with the student at the time.
Examples might include:
There will be some exceptional circumstances where we may decide to contact a student's Trusted Contact without their consent.
This will be undertaken following an assessment of risk, where we are unable to contact/engage with the student and where we have serious concerns about a student's safety and/or wellbeing.
The following are some examples of when this may be considered (please note that this list is not exhaustive)
Every circumstance is considered on a case-by-case basis.
We will not use your Trusted Contact without authorisation by senior staff in the Student Services team and ordinarily it would be with the consent of the student.
For many students, it may be that the same person is their Emergency and their Trusted Contact.
This won’t be the case though for everyone.
Your Emergency Contact will be used very rarely and only in the most serious of circumstances.
This would usually be where there is an immediate need and where it is in the vital interests of the student.
This would also likely be where Emergency services have raised a concern and have requested this information because of serious concerns and/or an emergency situation.
You are not legally required to provide a Trusted contact to us.
However, it is in your best interests and as such we strongly recommend that you do so.
It is important you take ownership of your nominated Trusted Contact and review it regularly.
You can change your nomination at any time in your student record.

As a parent / supporter, the start of your young person’s university journey can be both exciting and overwhelming.
While some young people adjust quickly and thrive, others may face challenges, whether in making friends, settling in, or keeping up with their studies.
It's natural to worry if your young person seems unhappy, but there are plenty of practical ways you can support their transition.
We recommend that you take the time to explore the student resources the university offers.
Knowing where to turn for support - whether it's academic, emotional, or practical - will allow you to offer guidance when your young person needs it.
Familiarise yourself with University Services: Student Services
Here are some other ways that you can get involved:
There are a few essential life skills that can help your young person feel more confident and independent at university:
Parental Contributions to Maintenance Costs
To ensure the student gets their full Student Finance entitlement you will be asked to provide evidence of your household income.
When you submit your household income to Student Finance, they will assess your financial situation, including your income and any dependents, to calculate the students Maintenance Loan and any grant they may be eligible for.
The level of financial contribution you are asked to make is often unclear, but you can contact your Student Funding provider for more information.
Changes in Household Income
If your income has decreased by 15% or more since the previous tax year, Student Finance may reassess the students funding.
This could result in additional loan support.
To request a reassessment, you'll need to complete a Current Year Income (CYI) Assessment Form.
Additional Financial Support
If your young person encounters financial difficulties while at university, they can reach out to the Advice and Money Team for help and guidance.
It's normal to worry if your young person hasn't responded to your messages or calls.
While there's often a good reason, it's natural to feel concerned.
Here are some steps you can take:
Support available at university:
There are various resources at the university to help your young person, including:
If you have concerns:
If you are worried about your young persons wellbeing you can submit your concerns through our online ' Report student wellbeing concerns ' form.
The Wellbeing Team will review any forms and appropriately address the concerns.
If you have any issues completing this form, please contact Student Support on 01970 621761 .
If you have urgent concerns about the safety of your young person then please call the emergency services on 999 .
Out-of-hours concerns:
For out-of-hours concerns, call the security team on 01970 622900 .
While we can receive and consider your concerns, we cannot share personal details about your young person without their explicit consent.
The university respects your young persons privacy as an independent adult learner, and we are required by the Data Protection Act 1998 to keep their information confidential.
While this may feel frustrating, we ask for your understanding.
Rest assured we are committed to providing a wide range of support for our student community.
If there are serious concerns about your young persons wellbeing or safety, we have safeguards in place.
If necessary, we will contact their nominated emergency contact, even without their consent, to ensure their safety.

Kieran Atkins from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences
Led by researchers in the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences and in Computer Science at the University, the study demonstrates the power of targeted applications of artificial intelligence to improve the quality of our crops.
Traditional ways of recording the traits of a plants’ fruit, such as their shape and size, are very labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error.
Researchers have addressed the challenge with a new AI powered tool that analyses images to recognise seed pods and measure them with high accuracy.
The new tool can measure a range of characteristics, including pod length, width, area and volume, all of which contribute to yield and therefore to profitability.
The research links these physical traits to specific genetic regions that influence pod shape and size, helping scientists pinpoint genes.
Identifying these genes helps scientists better understand how plants grow and develop.
Such discoveries provide valuable targets for crop breeding, making it possible to improve traits like yield, shape, and resilience.
These new AI tools could in principle be applied to any plant’s fruit, and researchers have been testing it on the seeds of many crops including, oil seed rape, cabbages, and even cereals such as oats, barley and wheat.
Kieran Atkins, PhD researcher and project lead from IBERS in Aberystwyth University, said:
“AI tools like the one we have developed have the potential to revolutionise how we can develop new varieties of crops.
It really is a game changer.
Our algorithm collected data on over 300,000 individual fruits - underscoring the capability of deep learning as a robust tool for phenotyping very large populations.”
“One of the most exciting aspects of this work is how accessible it makes large-scale phenotyping.
By removing technical and time barriers, deep learning enables more researchers to explore plant traits at a scale that wasn’t practical before.
It’s about unlocking new possibilities for discovery and innovation in plant science.”
Professor John Doonan, Director of the National Plant Phenomics Centre, at Aberystwyth University added:
“The results demonstrate that deep learning AI can provide data with the quality and accuracy required for genetic analysis and breeding.
This shows how advanced imaging and AI can transform the way we connect plant form to genetic function.
Initially we developed the tools for a small weedy plant that’s often used as a model in labs around the world, but very similar approaches work extremely well on brassica crops.
This is an important step toward scalable, data-rich phenotyping that not only accelerates research but also supports more predictive approaches to crop improvement.”
The team has made their MorphPod tool available online, enabling researchers around the world to replicate or adapt the system for use with other plant species.

Remaining stationary in the water is essential for fish as it helps them look out for predators, access prey in small crevices and feed on hard-to-reach resources like aquatic plants.
Fish achieve this by so-called “hovering” which includes corrective fin and body movements.
Without these movements, they would naturally flip sideways or upside down.
The research, carried out by a team including an academic from Aberystwyth University’s Department of Computer Science, discovered that hovering requires twice as much energy compared to resting.
The reason for the excess energy use is instability, which is caused by the swim bladder, a gas filled sac that sits within nearly all bony fishes.
Although the swim bladder provides the buoyancy that stops a fish from sinking, it also creates a stability problem.
Due to the location of the swim bladder, there is a separation between the centre of buoyancy and centre of mass, and this separation makes fish inherently unstable.
This is why dead fish are seen floating on their sides or upside down because they naturally tip.
The findings could have implications for the design of more manoeuvrable and stable miniature aquatic robots.
The research involved the team placing 13 species of bony fish in a specialised tank and recorded oxygen consumption while they were hovering and while they were at rest at the bottom of the tank.
High speed cameras were used to track fin movements.
Body size and shape were also measured from each fish to investigate what influences instability during hovering.
This data was then used to create a simple model to link the body properties of fish to metabolic cost of hovering.
The model suggests that fish with deep compact bodies, such as goldfish, were more efficient in their hovering, while long slender fish such as rummy-nose tetra had more difficulty.
Dr Otar Akanyeti, from Aberystwyth University’s Department of Computer Science, said: “You would have thought that staying still would be easy but this research has upended this assumption.
Hovering is essential for fishes to eat, avoid predators or hunt prey but it has energetic consequences that are not negligible.
It is similar to trying to balance on an inflatable tube in the swimming pool or sea, which is harder than it first looks.
“The findings have important real-life implications for sea exploration.
First, they help us with ecological modelling to better understand fish behaviour.
Second, they can be used to improve the manoeuvrability of undersea robots, raising the possibility of them being able to access previously unreachable areas.
“Undersea robots are traditionally compact for stability but by using these findings, we can in effect build in some instability to help the robots move in the same way as fishes who hover more effectively.”
The findings were published in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
In addition to Dr Akanyeti, the study was co-authored by seven institutions.
The research was led by the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Dr Wyn Morris (left) from Aberystwyth Business School and Dr Gareth Norris from the Department of Psychology at Aberystwyth University who have developed the rural crime study.
18 August 2025
A new Wales-wide survey on the impact of farm and rural crime has been launched by Aberystwyth University.
Funded by the Cymru Wledig Local Policy and Innovation Partnership (LPIP) Rural Wales, the ‘Rural Crime Survey - LPIP 2025’ is being conducted in collaboration with all four Welsh police forces.
Building on previous surveys carried out since 2017, which have led to changes in how Dyfed-Powys is policed, this latest study aims to assess progress made in addressing community perceptions of farm and rural crime.
The survey revisits the main issues raised in previous surveys to assess the effectiveness of interventions and the opinions of stakeholders.
It is open to both farmers and rural residents served by Wales’ four police services.
The findings will inform police, farmers and rural communities, while also contributing to academic research.
The survey is divided into four key sections:
Dr Wyn Morris from Aberystwyth Business School said:
“This survey provides a crucial opportunity to understand how far Wales has come in tackling farm and rural crime.
By examining the findings alongside previous surveys, it will highlight what’s working, assess the impact of interventions, identify ongoing challenges and inform the best ways to support rural communities in the future.”
Dr Gareth Norris from the Department of Psychology added:
“Rural crime affects people’s sense of safety and wellbeing as much as it affects property.
This new Rural Crime Survey will provide insights into the impact of measures taken to support communities at risk, and ensure that the voices of farmers and rural residents are heard and reflected in shaping future support and policing strategies.”
Dafydd Llywelyn, Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner, commented:
“We understand how deeply rural crime can affect those directly targeted and understanding the needs of our rural communities remains essential to delivering effective policing across the Dyfed- Powys area.
This survey is an important opportunity for people to share their experiences and have their say by completing the survey, and I urge residents to take a few minutes to complete the survey.”
The survey can be completed anonymously online in either English or Welsh .

Dr Elin Royles from our Department of International Politics
The report by Dr Elin Royles from Aberystwyth University lists 13 recommendations on how to improve good practice in the relationship between the economy, the language and the workplace across different sectors.
The study was commissioned by research firm Wavehill as part of an evaluation of the Arfor II programme – a Welsh Government-funded initiative funded which brought together local authorities in Gwynedd, Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire to develop plans to promote economic development, and in turn, boost the prospects of the Welsh language.
Although the research focus sought to inform developments in these four western counties of Wales, Dr Royles says that implementing many of the recommendations is most relevant to bodies that lead on the Welsh language and the economy at a national level across Wales.
"We know that various efforts initiatives to support language planning in workplaces in the Basque Country have led to extensive expertise over the past two decades, and we can learn more from what is happening there," said Dr Royles, who is a Reader in the Department of International Politics at Aberystwyth University.
"To date, much of the emphasis has been on how the Welsh language can be an economic advantage for businesses and increasing the opportunities for customers to use the language when dealing with private companies.
What this report does is highlight the additional opportunities to develop how we discuss the role of workplaces in language promotion and methods to support using the Welsh language in businesses, cooperatives and social enterprises.
Many of the recommendations are also relevant to the public sector."
Among the recommendations are:
The research was funded as part of Wavehill’s contract to evaluate the Arfor II programme.

14 August 2025
With a total of 12 performance indicators ranging from student satisfaction with teaching quality to social inclusion, the Daily Mail league table is the broadest-based ranking of 128 UK universities.
In the latest rankings, Aberystwyth University performed particularly strongly for the quality of its teaching, student support and the wider student experience - reaching the top 12 in the UK on all three performance measures.
Judges also cited the School of Veterinary Science – the only one in Wales – as a key differentiator.
The Welsh University of the Year award follows a series of top accolades for the University.
Aberystwyth was rated top university in Wales for student satisfaction in the latest edition of the National Student Survey for the tenth year in a row.
The first University College in Wales, it was also rated top in England and Wales for student experience in The Times/Sunday Times’ Good University Guide 2025.
Professor Jon Timmis, Vice Chancellor of Aberystwyth University, said:
“This award is testament to the commitment and excellence of our staff.
On the back of our fantastic results in the National Student Survey, every single member of our community here in Aberystwyth can be proud of our long and proud tradition of pushing the boundaries of innovation and knowledge.
“For over 150 years, our excellence in teaching and research has inspired generations of people to change lives for the better: growing knowledge, building communities and strengthening Wales and the wider world.
“This award also underlines our status as one of the most inspiring locations to live and study in the UK.
Our town is well-known as a friendly and vibrant community in a safe and affordable place that welcomes staff and students from around the globe.”
Alastair McCall, Editor of the Daily Mail University Guide, said:
“Students love Aberystwyth.
For many years now, students have given the University outstanding scores in the annual National Student Survey for the quality of teaching, student support and the wider student experience.
This year was no exception with the University sitting in or just outside the UK top 10 across all three performance measures, according to a Daily Mail analysis.
“The views of its own students played a key role in making Aberystwyth the Daily Mail Welsh University of the Year 2026.
Aber’s reputation for providing an outstanding university education and experience is growing with applications running at record levels.
Outstanding facilities include the only veterinary school in Wales.
“Its stunning location on the west Wales coast is undoubtedly part of the attraction, alongside the size of both the town and the University, which allows students to be names and not numbers.
In a sometimes vanilla world, Aber provides a higher education of distinction.
With its appeal at an all-time high, Aberystwyth was the standout candidate to be Daily Mail Welsh University of the Year.”

Dr Jenny Mathers, Department of International Politics
08 August 2025
Writing in The Conversation, Dr Jenny Mathers discusses Ukraine’s former prime minister's recent comments that there is too much western involvement in its institutions and explores whether they are justified.
Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko recently called for an end to what she called the western “colonial model” of interference in Ukraine’s domestic politics.
In a speech to the Ukrainian parliament in July, she welcomed the passage of a law bringing two anti-corruption bodies under greater government control (which led to protests across the country and eventually government backtracking).
She described it as the first step towards the restoration of the country’s sovereignty and called for lawmakers to go further.
Tymoshenko was referring to the role played by foreigners – mainly representatives of western donors supporting Ukraine’s political reforms – in approving appointments to key Ukrainian state institutions.
This practice is one of the measures that Ukraine has introduced to tackle corruption.
Its purpose is to introduce external scrutiny to ensure the independence of the organisations and especially the judges who deal with allegations of corruption.
One example of this is the Ethics Council .
Created in 2021 by a law passed by Ukraine’s parliament, it is composed of six members: three Ukrainians and three foreigners.
The council vets nominations for the High Council of Justice (HCJ), which is the most important institution in Ukraine’s judiciary.
The HCJ not only appoints judges but also makes decisions on their suspension and arrest when they are accused of wrongdoing.
While the membership of the Ethics Council is equally divided between Ukrainian and foreign members, in practice the votes of the foreigners are weighted more heavily than those of the Ukrainians .
This means that its foreign members can veto any nomination that comes before the council.
At first glance, Tymoshenko’s critique of this type of international oversight seems reasonable.
Why should a sovereign state subject its own internal processes – especially processes of such sensitivity as judicial appointments – to close scrutiny by foreign citizens?
In a recent interview with the Times newspaper , Tymoshenko elaborated on her speech, arguing that these measures exist because of pressure from western governments and international organisations.
She also pointed to “threats” to withdraw support, especially financial support, if Ukraine does not comply.
Ukraine’s international donors have certainly made it clear that they expect Kyiv to undertake judicial reform and other meaningful measures to tackle corruption.
The International Monetary Fund routinely reviews Ukraine’s progress in these areas when it decides whether to release of the next tranche of funding.
Since the start of Russia’s full scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has received approximately US$12.8 billion (£9.3 billion) from the IMF.
Similarly, the European Union has made addressing corruption and ensuring the independence of the judiciary key conditions for Ukraine to progress towards full EU membership.
Volodymyr Zelensky’s government cannot afford to risk losing the money Ukraine receives from international donors such as the IMF, which helps to keep the country’s economy functioning while it is at war.
Neither can he afford to ignore the requirements of EU membership.
Joining the European Union is a goal that Zelensky has championed for Ukraine.
It is also very popular among Ukrainians.
According to a May 2024 opinion survey , 90% of Ukrainians would like to see Ukraine join the EU by 2030.
But western pressure is not the only reason for foreign oversight of key institutions and processes in Ukraine.
It is a step that has received strong support from Ukrainian civil society.
The Dejure Foundation , a Ukrainian legal organisation which promotes the rule of law and judicial reform, regards the involvement of international experts as essential to ensure a professional and independent legal system.
External scrutiny is also regarded as a way of increasing public trust in the judiciary.
A December 2024 opinion poll found that only 12% of Ukrainians trust the courts, mainly because of perceptions that judges are corrupt.
To be sure, the involvement of foreign experts is not a magic bullet.
Even supporters of the measure claim that foreigners lack the knowledge of the local context and can be manipulated into supporting bad decisions.
But supporters argue that international scrutiny should be supplemented by greater involvement of Ukrainian civil society organisations, not removed.
The issue of corruption and how to address it remains a live one in Ukraine, and has no straightforward solution.
The introduction of international legal experts into the process of scrutinising key appointments has not eliminated the problem or restored public faith in the judiciary.
Zelensky and his government are coming under increasing pressure from Tymoshenko and her supporters’ attempts to make political capital out of the issue.
In particular her call to remove foreigners from these roles and replace them with war veterans is a clear appeal to nationalist sentiment.
On the other hand, Ukrainians do not seem to object to meeting the requirements of western organisations.
More than 70% of Ukrainians surveyed in 2023 agreed that it was right that the EU should require political reforms before opening negotiations for Ukraine’s accession.
Moreover, protests erupted in July in cities across Ukraine against the legislation that would have brought Ukraine’s national anti-corruption bodies under the direct control of the government-appointed prosecutor general.
Zelensky has now submitted a new bill to reinstate the agencies’ independence.
These demonstrations revealed a strength of feeling against any dilution of the independence of those who are charged with dealing with corruption.
This suggests that Tymoshenko may not gain much traction in any attempts to dismantle existing systems, however imperfect they may be.

Glaciar Perito Moreno was once considered a rarity: one of Patagonia’s only stable glaciers.
But scientists have found the glacier is now in sudden and probably irreversible retreat – and this collapse is a warning for the world’s remaining ice.
Perito Moreno is unusually accessible for such a large and spectacular glacier, with nearly 700,000 visitors a year.
Fed by abundant snowfall high up in the Andes, the glacier descends through beech forest to end in Lago Argentino.
From here, tourists can get up close and personal on a specially constructed observation deck to watch as icebergs break off the front of the glacier, a process called iceberg calving.
Icebergs regularly crack off the ice front and tumble into the turquoise lake below.
But now, it’s on the verge of disappearing.
While 90% of Patagonia’s glaciers are shrinking , Perito Moreno has long been the exception thanks to its unique setting.
The glacier flows into a narrow channel of Lago Argentino, where it sometimes advances far enough to block one arm of the lake entirely.
This forms a natural ice dam, cutting off water flow and causing water to build up behind it.
When the pressure becomes too much, the dam bursts.
These ruptures typically happen every few years, but timing can be unpredictable.
The glacier been stable up to now and has not been shrinking because it terminates in relatively shallow water where it bumps into the opposite shore.
But this is all about to change, as years of reduced snowfall and warmer summers have weakened the glacier.
A team of scientists based in Germany and Argentina have tracked its changes over time, and used satellite data, helicopter-mounted radar and lakebed mapping to predict its future behaviour.
In a new study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment they report that the glacier’s surface has lowered sharply in recent years, and it’s now retreating faster – while the ice itself is flowing more quickly.
They believe Glaciar Perito Moreno will never advance again onto the opposite lake shore.
Instead, it is predicted to keep pulling back further into the lake, encountering deeper and deeper water, which will only accelerate its collapse.
That’s because glaciers calve more rapidly in deeper water.
The authors predict the front of the glacier will soon begin to float, making it even more unstable.
The glacier is entering a phase of very rapid and probably irreversible retreat.
Tourists may see more dramatic calving in the short term – but they’ll be watching the slow disappearance of one of Patagonia’s iconic natural wonders.
Eventually, they’ll be unable to see the glacier at all, as it recedes back into the mountains behind.
The retreat of Perito Moreno will represent more than a missed photo opportunity – it’s symptomatic of what’s happening to mountain glaciers around the world.
Glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded .
Since 2000, mountain glaciers have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes – or 5% – of their ice.
In Iceland, they’ve even held funerals to mark the death of glaciers.
As these glaciers melt, they return their stores of freshwater to the oceans, pushing sea levels higher.
If they melted entirely, mountain glaciers would raise global sea-levels by 32cm (just over a foot) .
We’re some way off that point, but this does mean people living along the coast are likely to feel the impact of melting glaciers.
The effects will also be felt far inland.
As glaciers retreat, they can trigger huge floods as lakes backed up behind the ice and their moraine dams suddenly empty when the natural dam bursts.
These so-called glacial lake outburst floods are a growing threat to 15 million people worldwide.
Other catastrophic events can be linked directly to glaciers changing.
For instance, in May 2025 the Birch Glacier in Switzerland collapsed when a chunk of nearby mountain broke loose and fell into the ice.
The resulting avalanche completely destroyed the village of Blatten .
In cases like these, close monitoring and early evacuation save lives .
There are other human consequences related to water supply.
Glaciers act as natural freshwater reservoirs; storing winter snow and releasing meltwater through the year.
Hundreds of millions of people rely on them for drinking water, farming and sanitation.
When the glaciers disappear, so does that steady supply of water.
The projected loss of Glaciar Perito Moreno is not just a problem for Patagonia.
It is an icy warning of what lies ahead for the world’s remaining glaciers.

Left to right: Jafar Daji (Parkinson-Spencer Refractories) and Dr Odin Moron-Garcia, Dr Adil Mughal, and Dr Chris Finlayson (Aberystwyth University) in front of the kiln
04 August 2025
A new collaboration between Aberystwyth University and Parkinson-Spencer Refractories (PSR) in West Yorkshire will see the development of tools which use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to ensure a kiln is packed as densely and as efficiently as possible.
A family business established more than 200 years ago, PSR manufactures ceramic products of various shapes and sizes for the glass industry, which need firing in large energy-intensive kilns.
Currently, the average volume utilisation of a kiln firing at PSR’s factory is as little as 9%, due to the irregularity of the products being fired on the kiln and the complex loading techniques.
This limits the company’s manufacturing capacity and results in high energy costs and carbon emissions per tonne of product produced.
Any improvement in how kilns are packed during a single firing session would increase production capacity and energy efficiency, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
To help find a solution, PSR has worked with Aberystwyth University on a successful application for a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) funded by Innovate UK and the Welsh Government.
A KTP Associate with a PhD and expertise in computational problem-solving has now been appointed.
Dr Odin Moron-Garcia will take up his role in May 2025, working mainly at PSR’s factory in Halifax as well as collaborating with the research team at Aberystwyth.
The research team is led by Dr Adil Mughal from the Department of Mathematics at Aberystwyth University.
He said:
“This project plays a pivotal role in the exchange of expert knowledge and the bridging of the gap between academic research and industrial application.
“Creating innovative, customised algorithms to optimise the dense packing of complex-shaped objects will lead to a significant reduction in the ceramic industry’s carbon footprint, driving critical environmental benefits.
These advancements will not only be a technical improvement to the manufacturing process but also a vital step towards sustainability in the industry.”
Left to right Helena O’Sullivan, Dr Adil Mughal and Odin Moron-Garcia from Aberystwyth University with Simon Parkinson and Jafar Daji from Parkinson-Spencer Refractories, and Dr Chris Finlayson from Aberystwyth University
Simon Parkinson, the Managing Director of PSR, said:
“We are delighted to be working with Aberystwyth University on this exciting and potentially transformative project.
We hope it will lead to us being able to produce refractories in a more energy efficient manner, supporting our drive towards becoming a more sustainable business.”
Helena O’Sullivan, Business Development Officer at Aberystwyth University’s Department of Research, Business and Innovation, said:
“Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are a brilliant way of connecting us as a university with industry.
They allow business to gain access to cutting-edge academic expertise they may not have in-house, helping them to solve innovation challenges, develop new products or ideas and become more competitive.
At the same time, academics are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge to important business problems, drive innovation and make a positive difference to the economy.”

Aberystwyth University student nurses celebrating qualifying
01 August 2025
The students began their studies when the University’s Healthcare Education Centre first opened its doors in September 2022.
The £1.7 million centre located opposite Ysbyty Bronglais in Aberystwyth includes high quality clinical practice rooms and was supported with a grant of £500,000 from the Welsh Government.
Among the almost 40 students who have just completed their courses, some studied adult nursing and others mental health nursing.
The degree courses have now expanded with 239 studying at the University this year.
Students who studied for the degree had the opportunity to follow up to half of their course through the medium of Welsh.
A special ceremony was held at the Gwendolen Rees building to celebrate the University’s first cohort of qualified nurses with speeches from Martin Riley from Health Education Improvement Wales and Meri Huws, Chair of the University’s Council.
"Many congratulations to all of the students on their great achievements.
As a university, we are extremely proud to train the next generation of nurses for the NHS.
That is exactly the type of role we as an organisation should be undertaking and want to do more and more.
It’s at the heart of our agenda to change lives for the better, grow knowledge, build communities and strengthen Wales.
"We all know how dependent we are on the health service and its key workers.
I was delighted to recently sign a renewed partnership with the Health Board.
Over the next few years, we are keen to play an increasing role in the vital work of training our health professionals."
Amanda Jones, Head of Healthcare Education at Aberystwyth University added:
"It is so heartening to see our students succeed and prepare to assist patients in the real world.
It has been an honour to be part of history - teaching the first ever cohort of nursing students here in Aberystwyth.
I wish them all every success for the future."
Lisa Gostling, Director of Workforce & Organisational Development and Deputy Chief Executive Officer at Hywel Dda University Health Board said:
“It has been a pleasure to work in partnership with Aberystwyth University to train the next generation of nurses.

During the session, one of the editors of The Conversation will discuss why you should communicate your research to the public and take you through The Conversation’s unique, collaborative editorial process.
They will also look briefly at style and structure, different approaches and types of articles, and how to pitch.
Please register below to reserve your place:
We have a small number of spaces available for AU academics or researchers who would like the chance to speak to an editor from The Conversation on a one-to-one basis over Zoom.
Maybe you already have an idea for an article and would like to discuss it further before developing your pitch?
This is a chance to learn how to consider the news potential of your expertise, how to look for story hooks and angles from the news, how to write a quality story pitch to section editors, and other advice.
To enquire about the availability of a one-to-one, please e-mail Alice Earp .
Four short online training courses are available for researchers, academics and PhD candidates to access at a time to suit them.
The courses aim to help academics understand how The Conversation works, the editorial support that is provided, and to develop the skills to write for non-academic audiences.
The courses are mapped to Vitae’s researcher development framework and therefore can contribute to professional development.
