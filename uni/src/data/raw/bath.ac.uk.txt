How KTPs work
A Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) is a three-way collaboration between a company, a UK university, and a graduate, designed to realise a transformative business opportunity.
For over 40 years, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships have been helping companies to innovate for growth by accessing the UKâs world-leading knowledge base.
Partnerships can cover any important area where there is a need for additional expertise and resources, enabling dynamic organisations to improve their competitiveness, productivity and performance.
Knowledge transfer is achieved by the University of Bath employing one or more graduate, or 'Associate', to work on a strategic project based at the company, varying in length from 2 to 3 years.
An academic supervisor at the University, with relevant expertise to the programme, maintains close involvement with the graduate and organisation throughout.
The programme aims to stimulate innovation, by providing industry based training and development of talented University graduates, including post-graduates.
Around 70% of associates are offered a post with the company on a permanent basis, following project completion.
Companies are eligible for a grant of up to 67% as an SME or up to 50% for a larger organisation KTPs can benefit businesses of any size and in any sector looking to address a core strategic challenge.
KTPs are funded by Innovate UK who has recently introduced new Management Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (MKTPs) for improved management practice and business performance.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/largest-ever-study-into-cannabis-use-and-mental-health-unveiled:
The use and potency of cannabis is increasing worldwide, with rising levels of dependence and cannabis-induced psychosis, particularly in North America.
Two new peer-reviewed studies, both drawing on data from Cannabis & Me , the largest survey of its kind, have identified key risk factors linked to paranoia in cannabis users.
The first study, published in BMJ Mental Health , examined the relationship between peopleâs reasons for first using cannabis and their later patterns of use.
A total of 3,389 former and current cannabis users aged 18 and over completed the survey, which captured their motivations for first and continued use, their weekly consumption in THC units, and their mental health.
Findings show that respondents who first used cannabis to self-medicate for pain, anxiety, depression, or minor psychotic symptoms reported significantly higher paranoia scores compared with those who tried cannabis out of curiosity or for fun, who had the lowest average paranoia and anxiety levels.
Professor Tom Freeman , Director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath and a senior author on the study, said:
A key finding of our study is that people who first used cannabis to manage anxiety or depression, or because a family member was using it, showed higher levels of cannabis use overall.
In future, standard THC units could be used similarly to alcohol units, for example, to help people track their cannabis consumption and better manage its effects on health.
Dr Giulia Trotta , a Consultant Psychiatrist and Researcher at Kingâs IoPPN and the studyâs first author said:
This comprehensive study is the first to explore the interplay between childhood trauma, paranoia, and cannabis use among cannabis users from the general population.
We have not only established a clear association between trauma and future paranoia, but also that cannabis use can further exacerbate the effects of this, depending on what form the trauma takes.
Our findings will have clear implications for clinical practice as they highlight the importance of early screening for trauma exposure in individuals presenting with paranoia.
Respondents reported consuming an average of 206 THC units per week - equivalent to around 10â17 joints if using cannabis with 20% THC, the level typical of strains currently available in London.
However, those who began using cannabis to cope with anxiety, depression, or because others in their household were already using it, consumed significantly higher weekly amounts.
In a second study, published in Psychological Medicine , researchers explored the relationship between childhood trauma, paranoia, and cannabis use.
Over half (52%) of respondents reported experiencing some form of trauma.
Those who had experienced trauma, particularly physical or emotional abuse, reported higher average levels of paranoia.
Crucially, the researchers found that cannabis use can exacerbate the impact of childhood trauma on paranoia, with different types of trauma linked to differing effects.
Professor Marta Di Forti , Professor of Drug Use, Genetics and Psychosis at Kingâs IoPPN, and senior author on both studies, added:
There is extensive debate globally about the legality and safety of cannabis use.
Our findings show that while some individuals turn to cannabis as a way of coping with pain or trauma, this may carry significant risks for their mental health and wellbeing.
Policymakers should consider these risks carefully when debating legalisation.
The Cannabis & Me project was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and jointly led by the University of Bath and Kingâs College London.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/why-mental-health-advice-often-adds-to-your-to-do-list:
From âtry yogaâ to âstart journaling,â most mental health advice piles on extra tasks.
Rarely does it tell you to stop doing something harmful.
New research from the University of Bath and University of Hong Kong shows that this âadditive advice biasâ appears everywhere: in conversations between people, posts on social media, and even recommendations from AI chatbots.
The result?
Well-intentioned tips that may leave people feeling more overwhelmed than helped.
With mental health problems rising worldwide and services under strain, friends, family, online communities and AI are often the first port of call.
Understanding how we advise each other could be key to making that support more effective.
A collection of eight studies involving hundreds of participants, published in Communications Psychology , analysed experimental data, real-world Reddit advice, and tested ChatGPTâs responses.
Participants advised strangers, friends, and themselves on scenarios involving both harmful habits, like gambling and missing beneficial activities, such as exercise.
Additive dominates - Across every context, people suggested adding activities far more than removing harmful activities.
Feasibility and benefit â  Doing more was seen to be easier and more beneficial than cutting harmful things out.
Advice varies by relationship â cutting harmful things out is viewed as easier for our close friends than for ourselves.
AI mirrors human bias â ChatGPT gave predominantly additive advice, reflecting patterns in online social media.
Senior author, Dr Tom Barry from the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, England said:
In theory, good advice should balance doing more with doing less.
But we found a consistent tilt towards piling more onto peopleâs plates and even AI has learned to do it.
While well-meaning, it can unintentionally make mental health feel like an endless list of chores.
Co-author, Dr Nadia Adelina from the Department of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong said:
As AI chatbots become a major source of mental health guidance, they risk amplifying this bias.
Building in prompts to explore what people might remove from their lives could make advice more balanced and less overwhelming.
This research was supported by the Research Promotion Fund of the Department of Psychology, University of Bath, England.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/university-of-bath-awarded-triple-gold-in-the-teaching-excellence-framework-2023:
The University achieved Gold awards, the highest awards possible, for both the overall assessment and the two underpinning assessments of student outcomes and student experience.
The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) is a national scheme run by the Office for Students (OfS).
Higher Education institutions in England are assessed on the extent to which a provider delivers an excellent experience and outcomes for its mix of undergraduate students and across the range of its undergraduate courses and subjects.
The Gold award in each aspect of the assessment means that the TEF panel judged that at Bath the undergraduate student experience and student outcomes are typically outstanding.
The ratings from TEF 2023 will last for four years from September 2023.
Professor Ian White, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Bath, said: âI am delighted that the University of Bath has achieved Gold in all three Teaching Excellence Framework 2023 ratings.
âThis is a testament to the work, commitment and engagement of so many members of our University community, across our academic and professional services staff and our student community.
We can rightly take pride that the experience and outcomes for our undergraduate students have been judged to be among the best in the country.
âI would also like to pay tribute to all those colleagues who worked so hard on our TEF submission, recognising the detailed work undertaken, and of course the high-quality teaching and support of learning that we have delivered in recent years, which has allowed us to demonstrate such excellence.â
In the coming weeks summaries of the TEF panelsâ findings for each higher education provider are expected to be published by OfS.
Professor Julian Chaudhuri, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education and Global), said: âThis is a superb result and I join Ian in congratulating and thanking all our staff and students who have made this possible.
âSince the last TEF exercise the University has continued to enhance both how we approach student experience and our education provision, and it is extremely gratifying to see these decisions recognised with triple Gold ratings in the TEF 2023.
âI look forward to sharing more with our community when the TEF 2023 panel summary statements are published in due course, but for now thank you once again.â

This policy applies to all staff (including casual and voluntary workers), honorary and visiting staff, volunteers and students and third parties (e.g.
contractor, client or customer of the University).
This details how the University can be most effective in its impact on equality, diversity and inclusion and the elimination of harassment and discrimination (including our â#NeverOKâ campaign).
The University of Bath is committed to maintaining the highest standards of honesty, openness and accountability and to conducting its business in a responsible way.
The policy encourages employees to raise their concerns in a responsible way where there is malpractice (that is, illegal, improper or negligent behaviour) or wrongdoing within an organisation and, where they do so, protects those employees from reprisal.
This sets out the expectations on employees, students, and contractors to support the Universityâs efforts to provide a safe and healthy workplace and to meet their own individual duty of care to others.
This aims to ensure the safety and welfare of children and adults at risk whilst on the University's premises or while engaging in activities controlled by the University.
The University of Bath was represented on the Operations Board of the Bath and North East Somerset Community Safety and Safeguarding Partnership whose remit includes Modern Slavery issues.
This ensures our recruitment processes are non-discriminatory and that staff have a right to work in the UK, with checks made before they start work and that all immigration requirements are met as specified by UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI).
We continue to evolve our category management approach to managing expenditure with third party suppliers to the University, which allows us to manage supply chain risk by category and by supplier where necessary.
We recognise that modern slavery and human trafficking can occur anywhere in our supply chains both in the UK and internationally and regardless of the supplier size or nature of the products or services being purchased.
Periodic reviews of our supply chains by category allow the risks associated with modern slavery and human trafficking to be considered, identified and managed.
The Universityâs standard contractual terms and conditions used when procuring goods, service and works include provisions that embed the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act and provide the University with the powers to request information from our suppliers on the nature of their supply chains where necessary.
We highlight our commitment to tackling modern slavery and human trafficking to all new suppliers and seek confirmation that new suppliers have no convictions under the Modern Slavery Act and are compliant with the Act.
The University has developed a Responsible Procurement Code of Practice , which documents our aims related to the environmental, social, economic and ethical impact, which includes modern slavery and human trafficking, when procuring all goods, services and works.
This also makes it clear that all suppliers to the University are expected to comply with the principles of Responsible Procurement.
We are committed to using and selling ethically-sourced food in our hospitality outlets and catering services.
The University has been awarded the Gold Award for Best Fairtrade University, in recognition of our continued commitment to Fairtrade products, promotions and events, as well as our efforts over Fairtrade Fortnight.
Fairtrade standards explicitly prohibit the use of forced labour and child labour.
Independent auditors are used to look for evidence of abuse or discriminatory labour practices by employers, which are often indicators of modern slavery.
For the majority of our requirements we follow the Public Contract Regulations (PCRs) when procuring goods, services and works.
When the estimated value of the contract exceeds the PCRs value thresholds we ask all applicable bidding suppliers to confirm their compliance with the Modern Slavery Act.
The Living Wage Foundation has accredited the University as a Living Wage Employer.
This commits the University to ensuring that staff salaries keep pace with the cost of living.
As part of this initiative we also request that relevant suppliers to the University also pay their staff the National Living wage or greater when delivering services to the University.
The University utilises a range of available framework agreements established by the Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium (SUPC).
This consortium is committed to ensuring modern slavery and human trafficking does not exist within their supply chains and requires suppliers operating within high risk industries to commit to the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).
The ETI Base Code is founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is an internationally recognised code of labour practice, requiring that employment is freely chosen; freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected; working conditions are safe and hygienic; child labour shall not be used; living wages are paid; working hours are not excessive; no discrimination is practised; regular employment is provided; and no harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed.
The University is also a member of the âThe University Caterers Organisationâ (TUCO), and âThe Energy Consortiumâ (TEC).
Alongside SUPC, they are members of âUK Universities Purchasing Consortiaâ (UKUPC).
SUPC, TUCO, and TEC have all published their own Modern Slavery Act 2015 (Transparency in Supply Chains) Statements.
The University can also seek expert guidance and support from Electronics Watch via our relationship with SUPC where the purchasing of electronic equipment is concerned.
Electronics Watch brings together public sector buyers and civil society organisations in electronics production regions with experts in human rights and global supply chains.
They guide public procurement demand for decent working conditions in electronics supply chains and provide capacity for public buyers to follow up on contractual demands through worker-driven monitoring which helps workers to voice complaints and contribute to solutions.
The University also procures a range of goods and services from frameworks established by the Crown Commercial Service (CCS).
All suppliers appointed to relevant CCS frameworks have taken a modern slavery assessment using a CCS designed tool to ensure that risks associated with modern slavery within the respective supply chains are identified and addressed as appropriate.
This tool is also employed directly by the University when procuring goods and services from certain higher risk markets.
The University has access to a suite of resources on the subject of modern slavery and human rights provided by the Higher Education Procurement Academy.
Use of the guidance and tools ensures the University acts collaboratively and consistently with others in the Higher Education sector increasing the positive impact of our actions.
All professional procurement staff are trained annually in Ethical Procurement by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.
We will continue to review and where necessary evolve our working practices to ensure that the risks associated with modern slavery and human trafficking are managed effectively.
In particular, during the 2024-25 financial year we aim to focus on the following areas:
All professional procurement staff will undertake refresher training on Ethical Procurement provided by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) in order to ensure their knowledge of the subject is maintained.
The CIPS training is regularly updated to reflect current knowledge and best practice on the subject of ethical procurement and includes dedicated material on modern slavery and human trafficking.
We will continue to offer training on combating modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains to our community of requisitioners.
We will seek to launch a new Sustainable Procurement Policy giving due consideration to the Universityâs commitment to the risks associated with modern slavery and human trafficking within our supply chains.
We will continue to enhance awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking within our programme of safeguarding training.
We will continue to develop our knowledge and understanding of the high-risk industries by continuing to work closely with our key suppliers and supporting organisations such as Electronics Watch.
We will maintain an open dialogue with other buying organisations that have adopted recognised good practice when tackling modern slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains and seek to learn from their experience.
We will continue to promote the University Public Interest Disclosure Policy (Whistleblowing) reiterating its role in reporting instances of suspected modern slavery or human trafficking throughout any part of the University operation.
You can see previous versions of the Modern slavery and human trafficking statement on the Internet Archive.

All travel on University business must be booked in line with the Travel and expenses policy .

Before making your booking you should have permission from your line manager and have considered appropriate risk assessments in line with the Fieldwork safety standard .
You can book most of your travel needs through Clarity.
You must book flights, standard hotels and pre-booked UK rail via Clarity.
Straightforward bookings should be made online via ClarityGo, with more complicated journeys using the phone/email route.
Hotels do not need to be booked via Clarity where they are part of a conference booking, or rates are exclusively available through a partner institution, or where suitable accommodation is only available on another booking platform.
Services Clarity can book include:
Online via ClarityGo
Via phone/email
ClarityGo works from your traveller profile which you will need to create/update the first time you log in via Single Sign On.
You will not need to input this information again on future bookings.
To create your profile:
Your travel profile will contain all the information Clarity needs to make your travel arrangements.
Your email will be pre-filled, but you need to add your name etc first time you log in:
Existing bookings on Go2Book will still be available to view/amend Go2Book
Tutorials for booking flights, rail tickets and hotels are available on the landing page of ClarityGo
There will be occasions where a traveller finds a price online for a trip  that is cheaper than shows up on Clarity's system.
This is most often due to the search criteria used, but some websites quote low fares which then increase when you get to the point of purchase.
Clarity operate a Price Match Guarantee.
If you find a better offer for the same travel arrangements within 30 minutes from accepting their quote, they will book and match the same flight/hotel they you have sourced.
Please email pricematch@claritybt.com quoting âprice matchâ in the subject line and any Clarity reference.
Please include a screenshot to enable us to verify against their terms & conditions
UK rail tickets, point to point air tickets and straightforward hotel bookings should normally be booked online via ClarityGo rather contacting Clarity by phone or email to make the booking.
When a request is made to Clarity via email, a substantive response should be received within 3 hours (during the hours 9am to 5.30pm).
When the service level falls short of this response time, it is permitted that the booking can be completed by another means.
In this case, payment may be made through an advance, University purchase card or claimed via the expenses process.
Where this option is exercised, the initial acknowledgement response from Clarity must be replied to, advising them to take no further action,  in order to avoid duplicated effort.
If you are unable to make your travel arrangements within the constraints of the Travel and Expenses Policy due to individuals needs associated with disability or accessibility, then proceed with your booking ensuring that your profile within ClarityGo has the âpreferencesâ page updated with the relevant information.
Exemptions for any other reason require written approval from your Dean or respective member of the University Executive Board prior to making any bookings.
The permission must be obtained by exchange of email with your Dean/member of University Executive Board and will include the following information -
A copy of the exemption approval email must be sent to payments@bath.ac.uk in order to ensure consistency of approach and effectiveness of the Policy
Online bookings will require you to confirm that you have the exemption agreed.
Where this exception will be ongoing, a permanent dispensation will be agreed and automatically applied so you will not have to go through this process every time you book.
As the University has the details of your trip recorded by Clarity, there is no need for us to separately log trips.
Your trip will be automatically covered by the University's travel cover and assistance services provided by UMAL.
Visit their Travel Hub for full details of help available.
You should download the Summary of Cover and take the details with you.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/combating-harassment-and-sexual-misconduct-what-staff-need-to-know-and-do-about-upcoming-changes:
Last month we shared an initial announcement about upcoming changes relating to the Universityâs approach to combating harassment and sexual misconduct, to ensure compliance with the Office for Studentsâ (OfS) new condition of registration â which comes into effect onâ¯1 August 2025.
Following Council approval on 10 July, we would now like to make you aware of those changes and the actions you may need to take to comply.
Condition E6 requires all HE institutions to take robust, proactive steps to prevent and respond to harassment and sexual misconduct towards students.
From 1 August 2025, all higher education institutions are required to meet these conditions to maintain their registration with the OfS.
A Task & Finish Group with representation from across the University has been working alongside our trade unions, SU and other groups to consult on all key policy changes and to design and implement these changes by the 1 August deadline.
As a member of staff, you have a critical role in upholding the standards set out in Condition E6, particularly for those staff with academic, supervisory, mental health and wellbeing, and other responsibilities for students.
Hereâs what you need to know and do:
We have revised the Personal and Professional Relationships Policy , which now prohibits staff from entering into intimate personal relationships with students over whom they have teaching, research, pastoral, wellbeing or other professional responsibilities.
From 1 August 2025, staff are required to report an intimate personal relationship with a student without delay.
This process will ensure that all necessary actions are taken to support and protect all those involved.
If you are in an existing staff-student relationship that needs reporting, please refer to the âReporting a staff-student relationshipâ section below for details of what you need to do.
We would like to emphasise that if there is a relationship and it is reported without delay, then it will almost always be possible to make changes, so the staff member is not in a position of responsibility or power over the student who they are in an intimate personal relationship with.
This reporting process is focused on protecting all those involved and will be managed sensitively, supportively and confidentially.
The University has been careful in only applying the ban on intimate personal relationships to substantive roles where the member of staff has academic, assessment, supervisory / managerial, pastoral, wellbeing or other professional responsibilities for the students or is expected to have this over the period of the studentâs study at the University over the next year.â¯
To be an intimate personal relationship it must involve one or more of the following elements:
If you are in an intimate personal relationship that existed before the date condition E6 comes into force (1 August 2025) and that remains in existence orâ¯existed before the date that the staff member became a relevant staff member in relation to that student, this is excluded from the ban.
However, the relationship still needs to be recorded so alternative arrangements can be made to ensure the member of staff no longer has any professional responsibilities for the student.
Please read the scenarios below for some more examples of excluded relationships.
I am a student that also works in a casual role at the university, can I be in a relationship with another student?
In the University many of our students undertake in casual and/or low FTE employment (low-fractional) roles.
Therefore, the prohibiting of staff-student relationships will exclude members of staff where their primary status is as a student, but they also undertake one or more casual worker or low-fractional employee contract roles, such as sports coaches, student ambassadors, food and beverage assistants or cleaners.
The only such roles that will be included in the ban are where a student works in a role that has some form of authority or professional responsibilities towards the student with whom they are in an intimate personal relationship.
For example, a PhD student undertaking a Graduate Teaching Assistant role.
This is because these are significant roles where the postholders do have a position of responsibility, and from this power, over the students they are assessing.
I am a member of staff in an existing relationship with a student that I do not have professional responsibilities for, is my relationship now banned?
The ban on intimate personal relationships only applies to substantive roles where the member of staff has academic, assessment, supervisory / managerial, pastoral, wellbeing or other professional responsibilities for the student or is expected to have this over the period of the studentâs study at the University over the next year.
If you are unsure, please contact your HR Business Partner orâ¯ Peter Eley, Deputy Director (HR Services) who can advise.â¯
I am a student in an existing relationship with a member of staff; do I need to tell anyone, and will I get in trouble?
The member of staff is responsible for reporting the relationship, not the student.
If the relationship is reported without delay, then it will almost always be possible to make changes, so the staff member is not in a position of responsibility or power over the student who they are in an intimate personal relationship with.
I am in a staff-staff relationship, do these changes affect me?
These changes do not affect the existing policy on staff-staff relationships, other than applying the OfSâ definition of an intimate personal relationship to staff-staff relationships.
Under the current policy, if you are in a staff-staff relationship where one staff member has managerial responsibility or accountability for the other this must be reported without delay.
Please refer to and follow the requirement set out in section 4 of the Personal and Professional Relationships Policy .
If you are in a staff-student relationship that needs reporting, you need to email the Director of Human Resources and your Head of Department on a confidential basis to report the relationship.
If you are an academic member of staff, you will also need to contact your Dean.
You will need to provide the following information:
Once you have reported the relationship the Director of HR or an identified deputy will be in contact to confidentially and sensitively talk through the actions that may need to be taken so that you are not in a position of responsibility or power over the student.
The relationship will also be recorded in a central secure and confidential register.
This register is only accessible by a small number of identifiable senior staff.
The University has created a single comprehensive source of information which will go live on our staff and student webpages on 1 August 2025.
This sets out all our policies, procedures and guidance on what you need to do on matters relating to incidents of harassment and sexual misconduct, all in one place.
Please visit the site once it goes live and familiarise yourself with the information.
The University has also revised our existing #NeverOK trainingâ¯for staff and students to help you understand your responsibilities under Condition E6 and how to respond to incidents or concerns.
The new modules go live from 4 August 2025.
Thank you for engaging with these changes.
We are aware that this is a very complex area, and we will keep these arrangements very closely under review as the new policy comes into effect.
If you have any immediate questions or concerns about any of these changes, please contact your HR Business Partner orâ¯ Peter Eley, Deputy Director (HR Services) who will be able to give you advice on a confidential basis.

In the new parking permit year (01/08/2025 - 31/07/2026), we will be implementing a paperless permit system, which we hope will enhance the customer experience of applying for and updating permits as well as lower our environmental footprint and printing costs.
The University is implementing increases to our car parking charges, which are currently less than the benchmarked rates for Higher Education car parking and very significantly less expensive than more sustainable options like taking the bus.
This puts us out of step with the sector and our climate commitments.
The charges and your options for the 2025/26 academic year can be found on our parking webpages .
We recognise that the increase is higher than in previous years where we have kept changes to a minimum, including where we held increases well below the rate of inflation (RPI).
However, within the new pricing structure, we have carefully considered the need for flexibility and have taken into account colleagues on full, part time, shift or occasional hours as well as pay spine point.
For example, for occasional users, the new charge will be Â£3 per day which remains less than a return trip on the bus.
For colleagues purchasing an annual permit, the charge remains even less: a standard, non-discounted permit works out around Â£4.64 per week.
In addition to a 50% discount for colleagues up to and including spine point 15, there is a 25% discount for colleagues on spine points 16-36.
Please see our parking webpages for full details.
Despite changes to working patterns post-pandemic, it can still be a challenge to find a parking space on our Claverton Down campus, especially during core hours from Tuesday to Thursday.
We recognise this can make parking especially difficult, for example, for those with caring responsibilities and school drop offs.
Therefore, in parallel with these changes, we are implementing a series of measures in order to ease pressures on parking on campus including:
Other changes include:
Looking ahead, our carbon plans require us to address modes of travel to campus and to reduce the number of parking spaces.
In addition, Bath & North East Somerset Council is considering introducing a parking levy on businesses which could have a significant financial impact.
In the coming months, the Travel Advisory Group will be asking for your input about how we can support members of our community to consider alternative modes of transport, from exploring park and ride connections to car sharing schemes and more.
We will regularly review our plans to check they are working as intended.
In the meantime, you can read more about alternative modes of transport to campus including active travel and travelling by bus .

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/guides/appealing-against-an-academic-decision:
The Academic Appeals process provides a mechanism to challenge or to request for reconsideration a decision on academic progress, assessment, and awards.
Our academic appeals process is guided by the principles of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator's Good Practice Framework, and we are committed to ensuring that you will not be unfairly disadvantaged because you have challenged an academic decision made by us.
Before considering an appeal, you should refer to Regulation 17 , which sets out the process and related responsibilities for students and the University.
You can only appeal against decisions taken by a Board of Studies within your current year of study.
You will only be eligible to appeal once that decision has been formally communicated to you.
You cannot appeal against provisional results.
Dissatisfaction with a mark or set of marks, or any other aspect of the properly exercised academic judgement of the examiners, will not of itself be acceptable as a valid ground for an Academic Appeal.
Any action or actions which might be taken following consideration of an academic appeal are subject to the assessment and/or regulations that apply to your course and your overall academic performance to date.
Therefore, some desired actions or outcomes might not be possible.
Students are expected to act reasonably and fairly towards the University and its staff when making an Academic Appeal.
The University reserves the right to refuse repeat appeals made on issues already considered and appeals which it deems to be without serious purpose or value.
If you have concerns about assessment outcomes that have not yet been approved by a Board of Studies, you should seek advice in the first instance from your Director of Studies.
You may, for example, suspect errors in the totalling or transcription of marks or grades, or you might want to seek clarification about the marking process.
If you submit an Academic Appeal, and the issues you have raised in it could be dealt with more appropriately under another procedure (for example, the student complaints procedure), the University will advise you how it will consider your case.
To request a review of a decision relating to a breach of academic integrity, follow the steps in our information on Academic Misconduct .
Appeals will only be accepted if submitted, in writing, no more than 14 calendar days after notification of the academic decision against which you are appealing (this will have been sent to you by email to your University email address).
Appeals received after this deadline will not normally be considered.
You will normally be notified of the outcome of the Stage 1 appeals process within 35 calendar days of receipt of your appeal - or within 28 calendar days, if the outcome is that an Appeal Hearing will be held.
The Academic Appeals process allows you to appeal against a final decision taken by a Faculty, School or Doctoral Board of Studies about your academic outcome.
This decision must relate to one or more of the following:
Your appeal must be based on one or more of the following grounds:
that there exist circumstances affecting the performance of the candidate of which the Board of Examiners have not been made aware and which the candidate could not reasonably have been expected to have disclosed to the Director of Studies in accordance with Regulation 15.5 (a) [or for Doctoral students - to have disclosed at the time of assessment]
that there were procedural irregularities in the conduct of the examinations or formal programme/course assessments (including administrative error) of such a nature as to cause reasonable doubt whether the Board of Examiners would have reached its decision had the irregularities not occurred
that there is positive evidence of prejudice, bias or inadequate assessment on the part of one or more of the examiners
You must submit your Stage 1 Academic Appeal no more than 14 calendar days after notification of the academic decision against which you are appealing.
You must submit:
Your submission must contain all the details and evidence that you wish to be considered as part of the appeal process.
A group appeal can be submitted by several students on the same issue.
You must provide evidenceâ¯to support yourâ¯academic appeal case.

You must provide evidence that is available to you to make as clear a case as you can when you submit your academic appeal.
Your submission must contain all the details and evidence that you wish to be considered as part of this appeal process.
You will not normally have any further opportunity to present your case or provide further detail beyond the information you provide in the appeal form and the evidence you submit.
If you are making your appeal under ground 17.12c) i) - that there were mitigating circumstances around the time of your assessment which you did not tell the University about, and which you are raising now - your evidence should also clearly show why you were not able to disclose these circumstances at the time (for example, through the Universityâs Individual Mitigating Circumstances (IMCs) procedures or by raising them with your Director of Studies ).
Any evidence you provide does not need to be formal documentation if this is not available to you.
For example, if you do not have access to formal medical documents such as a letter from a doctor, you can supply alternative evidence such as copies of relevant (dated) correspondence or evidence of medication.
If your ability to provide specific evidence has been affected by events outside of your control, you should explain clearly what you intended to provide and why it is unavailable to you.
If there are circumstances where evidence you are hoping to provide to support your appeal will only be available later than the 14 calendar day deadline, you should make this clear when submitting your appeal, giving the reason you have not been able to provide the evidence sooner and a date by which the late evidence will be provided.
Stage 1 Academic Appeal forms must be sent to the appropriate contact.
If you are an undergraduate or postgraduate taught student , you should complete the Stage 1 Academic Appeal form and submit this to the Chair of the Board of Studies for your Faculty/School as follows:

In addition to the guidance available from Directors of Studies noted above, it is strongly recommended that you speak to SU Advice & Support before submitting an Academic Appeal, or as soon as you become aware of any issues with your academic progress.
SU Advice & Support provides independent support and guidance, and its staff can act as the friend or adviser permitted by Regulation 17.
Doctoral students can also get independent support and guidance from the University's Independent Advisor Service for Postgraduate Research Students .

If you are a student at the Royal Academy of Dance, you should seek advice from your Programme Leader or Manager, Studentsâ Union or Student Services.
Students may choose to submit a group appeal.
The Chair of the Board of Studies will determine whether this is appropriate or whether students should submit appeals individually.
Where it is determined that a group appeal is appropriate:
Adjustments may be needed to the appeals processes, including, for example, outcomes being applied to all group members, or an Appeal Hearing being conducted collectively for the group.
Individualsâ personal data should not be disclosed to the group, and group members will be informed directly and individually of outcomes that reflect their own circumstances.
Where it is determined that a group appeal is not appropriate:
Academic judgement : is âa judgment that is made about a matter where the opinion of an academic expert is essential.
So, for example a judgment about marks awarded, degree classification, research methodology, whether feedback is correct or adequate, and the content or outcomes of a course will normally involve academic judgment.â OIA; section 30.2
Assessment regulations : these are the rules that govern course outcomes, progression requirements, award eligibility and how degree classification is calculated.
The possible actions and outcomes resulting from an academic appeal will be limited by both your individual academic circumstances and the relevant assessment and/or other regulations, so you are advised to speak to your Director of Studies or SU Advice & Support about what may be possible in your situation.
Board of Studies : Boards of Studies are responsible to Senate for all matters relating to the organisation of education, teaching and research, including all examination matters.
While you may receive marks/grades and feedback throughout each stage of your course, you will not receive a formal progression or award notification, or final marks/grades, until the Board of Studies has met and made a decision to accept the recommendations from Boards of Examiners.
The Academic Appeals process applies to these final decisions only.
Chair of the Board of Studies : the academic member of staff who leads the meetings of the Board of Studies.
This is normally the Dean of the Faculty/School, or the Academic Director of the Doctoral College in the case of doctoral provision and will normally be the person who will make a decision regarding your Stage 1 Academic Appeal.
Director of Academic Registry : head of a central professional services department that provides a range of education-supporting services and regulatory guidance to the University community.
In the context of Academic Appeals, at Stage 2 the Director of Academic Registry will normally be the person who will make a decision regarding your Stage 2 request for review.
Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) : the independent body, external to the University, set up to review student complaints.
You can apply to the OIA for a review of your case if you remain dissatisfied with the outcome when both stages of the University Appeal procedure have been completed.
Secretary to Senate : in the context of Academic Appeals, at Stage 2, the Secretary to Senate is responsible for convening a Student Academic Appeals Committee.

University of Bath graduates continue to enjoy some of the best employment prospects in the UK, according to the latest Graduate Outcomes Survey (GOS) published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).
For the 2022/23 graduating cohort, 89% of Bathâs full-time UK-domiciled first-degree graduates in paid employment in the UK were in high-skilled roles 15 months after completing their studies.
This figure exceeds the average of 72% for Universities UK (UUK) members, placing Bath 6th nationally among this group of institutions.
Helen Stringer, the University of Bathâs Director of Employability and Student Success, said:
We're delighted that 89% of our graduates secured high-skilled employment, placing University of Bath sixth among all Universities UK members and well above the sector median of 72%.
This outstanding result demonstrates the value of a Bath 
education and confirms that our graduates are highly sought after by employers.
The University's performance in the Graduate Outcomes Survey reinforces its strong standing across national league tables for graduate prospects:
3rd for high-skilled employment â Daily Mail University Guide 2025
5th for career prospects â Guardian University Guide 2025
6th for graduate prospects â Complete University Guide 2026
7th for graduate outcomes â Times & Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025
Bath is ranked in the top 10 overall in each of these UK university guides.
The annual Graduate Outcomes Survey is the UKâs largest annual social survey, capturing information about the activities and perspectives of graduates 15 months after leaving higher education.
It covers all graduates from universities and colleges in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Note: 2022/23 data.
Institutions with at least 23 graduates in the sample are included.
Source: HESA Graduate Outcomes Survey via Heidi Plus.
Beyond employment outcomes, the Graduate Outcomes Survey also captures how well graduates feel their current activity aligns with their future goals.
At the University of Bath, 81% of graduates said their current role fits with their future plans, placing the institution 16th nationally - just behind Oxford and Cambridge (both at 82%).
This strong result highlights Bathâs continued focus on career readiness, underpinned by its Employability Strategy, which helps students define what success looks like for them and build the skills to achieve it.

The University of Bathâs Advancement Office â responsible for building impactful relationships with alumni, friends and donors â has announced the winners of its very own Dragons' Den competition, now in its second year.
This year, the competition aimed to identify and create opportunities for rising academic stars across the University who are in the earlier stages of their careers, to amplify their work.
Academics Dr Kate Fraser and Dr Melusine Pigeon, from the Faculty of Engineering & Design, were awarded Â£1,000 from the Alumni Fund for their pitch on developing an artificial heart for women.
Their pitch detailed the groundbreaking work of Team Bath Heart, an award-winning team of students designing, prototyping and testing an artificial heart to compete against teams worldwide.
As the academic leads for the team, the pitch was delivered by Dr Fraser and Dr Pigeon at both a semi-final and final to six entrepreneurial âDragonsâ.
"Participating in the Dragons' Den was a useful experience since we got a chance to see interesting projects from across the University,â says winner Dr Fraser, âand how different researchers approached the task of pitching for funding.
We got some great feedback from the Advancement Office on our pitch, and we look forward to implementing the feedback received from the Dragons."
Fellow award-winner Dr Pigeon adds, "Weâre thrilled to have won this prize.
Itâs a fantastic recognition of our collective effort and teamwork.
Thanks to everyone who supported us along the way.
We will make great use of this prize to strengthen our proof of concept."
The Dragons on the panel were a group of entrepreneurial Bath alumni and friends including Sharon Flood, Murray Kenneth, Nick Wood, Jon Craton, Jon Lee and Dr Andrew Chalmers.
The pitches were assessed on a range of criteria including accessibility and appropriateness; content; impact and outcomes; expertise and experience and audience engagement.
When it came to this yearâs winners, the Dragons were particularly impressed by the student involvement in the project and that the research was tackling a real need and gap in the market.
Academics who entered â nominated by their deans within their faculty â had the opportunity to pitch their ideas directly to potential funders, while engaging in conversations with university leaders and academics about philanthropy and project opportunities.
They also received bespoke coaching with their assigned Advancement Office relationship manager on how to pitch to a philanthropic audience.
Professor Tim Ibell, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering & Design, nominated the winning academics, as well as Dr Leen Jabban for her research in biomedical engineering: "This award is terrific recognition of the impactful and internationally leading research which Melusine and Kate, and all in their teams, undertake.
Well done!
And congratulations to Leen and her teamâs work too.
âIâd also like to thank the Dragons and all in the Advancement team for ensuring that research with impact means exactly that.
Celebrating such extraordinary expertise and talent is simply wonderful.â
Other projects pitched as part of the competition included research on how group identities can help and hinder transitions towards more sustainable futures, user-centered design in biomedical engineering, and the intersection of retailing, shopper marketing and technology, among many others.

"I am thoroughly enjoying learning from instructors currently active in the industrial design field,â says Cassandra, who is in the last few weeks of the course, âespecially in conversations about the role of a designer in the modern day, as well as effective design communication methods.
âThe course has made me a more well-rounded design engineer, understanding product viability, feasibility and desirability, and I am excited to show the skills I've learnt so far in my upcoming major individual design project."
Will Lewis (MEng Mechanical Engineering 2028) has been awarded funding to help take him to the design, build and test stages of his bicycle power meter project.
More specifically, the money is for microcontrollers and strain gauges â necessary components of his build.
âBuilding my own bike power meter has been an idea that I've had for a while,â says Will, âbut the cost of the necessary equipment made me push it into the long grass.
âThe Arthur Clements Award has given me the funding to turn that idea into a project that will not only enrich me as an engineer but allow me to pursue my specific engineering interests."
Elliot Routier (MEng Mechanical Engineering 2027) received support from the Arthur Clements Fund to attend a summer internship with Sherpa Mobile Robotics in Alsace, France, focusing on industrial robotics.
Under the guidance of the Chief of Architectural Software within the company, Elliot is conducting extensive research on AI technologies and their practical applications for industrial robotics.
âMy time in France has been exceptional,â says Elliot.
âThe company culture is vibrant and my colleagues have been incredibly welcoming.
My work involves exploring new ways to integrate AI within the company whether that's into our robotic systems, or helping employees use generative AI tools like ChatGPT more effectively.
âThe Arthur Clements Fund has been key in making this opportunity financially possible, and Iâm extremely grateful for this support.â
Ying Hu (PhD Mechanical Engineering 2028) is researching the dynamics of blood flow in blood-contacting medical devices.
Thanks to the Arthur Clements Fund, she is soon to attend the International Workshop on Flow-Induced Blood Damage in Rotating Systems 2024 held by University of Rostock in Rostock, Germany.
âI really appreciate and feel very grateful to be honoured with this award," says Ying.
"The workshop is an annual event that attracts a unique group of researchers working on the study of blood damage.
âAttending this workshop will be an important starting point for my research at Bath, where I study as an international student, as it will help me get more involved in this discipline and discover new opportunities.â
Minu Bahrami (PhD in Mechanical Engineering 2028) has also received financial support from the Arthur Clements Fund to attend the workshop.
Revan Ali (MEng Mechanical Engineering 2027) has been designing his electric plane model for the last two years.
The award will enable him to take the development and testing progress to the next level.
Specifically, the funding will help cover the cost of materials used in the plane, including raw materials, structural elements and electronic components.
âThe development of my testing plane and electric plane project has greatly been supported by the Arthur Clements award,â says Revan.
âWith this funding, I aim to refine the planeâs aerodynamics, enhance its structural integrity and achieve a successful flight with this lightweight, 3D-printed aircraft.â

In a new collaboration with renowned early childhood higher education provider Norland in Bath, The Norland Foundation is funding a PhD investigating the impact of screen time in neurodivergent preschool children.
The generous donation of more than Â£105,000, spread over four years, will support a PhD student within the Department of Psychologyâs Babylab.
The lab provides facilities for researchers to study what goes on in the minds of little ones, using specialist eye-tracking software and two-way mirrors to explore how young children see and interact with the world around them and the factors that influence their development.
This research is driving best practice recommendations, including Canadian government policies on paediatric screen time, and the UKâs National Childbirth Trust guidelines for parents and early years practitioners.
Principal of Norland, Dr Janet Rose, says: âWe are delighted that The Norland Foundation is able to support this valuable work.
Part of the Foundationâs mission is to promote the advancement of education in the early years, including supporting children with additional needs.
This important and topical research will undoubtedly contribute to our growing understanding of the impact of digital technology and its special focus on neurodivergent children is of particular significance."
Dr Rose continues: âIt also aligns perfectly with related research and activities previously funded by the Foundation.
These include supporting the development of the Transforming Autism Project and a local âstay and playâ provision for children with special needs.
We are hoping some of the findings will be published in the Norland Educare Research Journal, an initiative also funded by the Foundation.â
Professor Mark Brosnan, Head of the Universityâs Department of Psychology, says: âWe are very grateful for this impactful gift, which will support research into the effects of screen time on neurodivergent pre-school children.
With the rapid rise of childhood screen exposure and touchscreen devices enabling toddlers to watch and interact with digital media, itâs key that we understand the impacts at this crucial time in development so parents and carers can make informed decisions.â
This scholarship is part of Bathâs Research with Impact PhD programme, funded by generous philanthropic donations to support students over four years with a UKRI-pegged stipend and some study costs, while the University funds the fees.
Successful recipient of The Norland Foundation Research with Impact Scholarship, Abigail Bradley, will begin her studies in September 2024.
She says: âI feel very privileged to receive this opportunity from The Norland Foundation and the University of Bath.
"This is a fascinating area of research that needs to be better understood for youth development around screens, so I'm grateful to be given this opportunity to dive into a topic I am so passionate about.â

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/being-ignored-or-excluded-by-family-affects-workplace-performance-of-leaders-and-staff-new-study:
Family ostracismâbeing ignored or excluded by your own familyâcan significantly impair leadership effectiveness and reduce customer service performance, and organisations need to recognize it as a legitimate form of employee stress that can damage the workplace, new research shows.
The study, published in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology , explores how emotional strain from family exclusion spills over into professional life, affecting not only leaders but also the frontline employees they supervise.
The researchers describe family ostracism as being ignored in family conversations, excluded from decisions or unsupported during difficult times.
They carried out two studies in Pakistan and Morocco among hotel managers and employees in four and five-star hotels, to understand the impact.
The fallout of family ostracism means leaders are more likely to experience work alienation, where they feel emotionally detached and disengage from work goals.
They typically adopt a âlaissez-faireâ leadership style, characterised by passivity and disengagement.
âOur findings highlight a critical but often overlooked link between personal relationships and professional performance,â said Professor Yasin Rofcanin from the University of Bathâs Future of Work research centre.
âWhen leaders are emotionally depleted at home, their ability to engage, support, and guide their teams suffersâultimately affecting customer outcomes.â
People facing family ostracism might attempt to restore strained relationships by investing additional time, emotional effort and attention at home.
For example, increasing involvement in childcare, logistical planning or âemotional caretakingâ - reducing the time and energy they can devote to work.
âWhen leaders put more effort into resolving challenges at home it can drain the emotional and cognitive resources they need for work,â said Professor Rofcanin.
âIt can leave them mentally fatigued, emotionally exhausted and less able to engage meaningfully with professional responsibilities.
Over time, it can erode their sense of connection to their role, leading to feelings of detachment and disengagement.â
In practice, leaders showing signs of alienation might avoid team discussions, have little enthusiasm for employeesâ ideas, and distance themselves from decision-making responsibilities.
These behaviours reflect a breakdown in their connection to the work environment, which can trigger a ripple effect that undermines team morale and employee performance.
âWhen leaders lack the mental bandwidth or emotional resilience required to engage meaningfully in the workplace this crosses over to employees, eroding their motivation and capability to care for customersâ needs.
We see a negative impact on âcustomer stewardshipâ which is a key driver of service excellence.â said Professor Rofcanin.
The research is co-authored by academics at the University of Sharjah , the University of Aberdeen , Adiyaman University , and George Washington University .
The researchers found that leaders with high political skill â the ability to navigate social dynamics and influence others â are better able to buffer the negative effects of family ostracism, maintaining their engagement and leadership effectiveness despite personal challenges.
Dr Muhammad Usman , from the University of Sharjah, said: âThe findings highlight the need for organisations to take a more holistic view of leadership support that recognises family ostracism as a legitimate source of strain that can affect workplace dynamics.â
When the family turns away: Leader family ostracism, work alienation, and the crossover to frontline employees' customer stewardship behaviour is published in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/university-of-bath-joins-rollout-of-exercise-programme-for-older-adults-at-risk-of-mobility-loss:
Older people in regions around England will soon be able to benefit from the REACT (REtirement in ACTion), a group-based exercise programme proven to support people to improve and maintain their mobility and ability to live independently.
Thanks to over Â£1million of funding from the Vivensa Foundation, the REACT programme will now be scaled up in two regions of England (North Central London and Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire).
A team of researchers from the University of Bath and the University of Birmingham will work in partnership with local Integrated Care Boards (who pay for and co-ordinate health and social care services), voluntary sector organisations (including Age UK Bristol) and groups of older people.
Backed by a major clinical trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), REACT has already been shown to significantly improve older adultsâ physical function for at least two years and reduce health and social care costs.
In the new scaled-up programme at least 750 older people with mobility limitations will receive the programme which will help to:
Provide clear examples of how REACT can be delivered regionally
Establish efficient and inclusive recruitment and selection processes
Estimate the costs (and savings) and impact on health of delivering REACT
Identify the most appropriate funding model (e.g.
fully subsidised vs partly-subsidised)
Identify ways to overcome common barriers to delivery.
Dr Max Western , lead researcher from the Department for Health at the University of Bath and Director of the Centre for Motivation and Behaviour Change , said:
It is so exciting to see our clinical trial evidence be taken forward to an implementation evaluation so that we can discover how more older people can benefit from the successful REACT intervention.
Having interacted closely with participants who took part in the original REACT study I am fully aware just how popular and powerful this social exercise programme can be for individuals with mobility difficulties.
Professor Afroditi Stathi, lead researcher from the University of Birmingham, added:
As people get older their physical functioning and mobility decrease, in fact, studies show that one in three older people will develop severe mobility limitations.
This affects their health, ability to live independently, their quality of life and even how long they live.
The REACT study provided strong evidence that this decline can be slowed and even reversed.
We have a duty to accelerate the implementation of research, with such strong findings, into routine practice.
The REACT programme has already been very successful in reaching economically disadvantaged and ethnically diverse communities in a small-scale community roll-out in Bristol.
This new study will help us bridge the gap between research and real-world delivery, ensuring more older people across the UK can benefit from evidence-based support.
Our goal is to create a national blueprint for commissioning and scaling REACT.
Susan Kay, Chief Executive Officer of Vivensa Foundation said:
We know that researchers and community innovators already have great evidence for what works.
Our recent landscape analysis of the state of ageing-related research funding has shown that one of the key funding gaps is in helping to get these evidence-based interventions adopted at scale.
Weâre really looking forward to learning more about â and sharing - how this can be done well.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/roadmap-for-the-start-of-human-embryonic-life:
Even though the start of embryonic life is fundamental, it remains shrouded in mystery.
In a recent Perspective , Dr Maki Asami and Professor Tony Perry from the Laboratory of Mammalian Embryology at the University of Bath lay out a new framework for the beginning of development in mammals such as humans.
Their focus is on how genes become active in newly-formed embryos â a process that is essential for development to begin.
They suggest that because most earlier methods were relatively insensitive, they only detected gene activity when levels were high, not when it starts.
Weaving together computer analysis and these precision measurements in mouse embryos, the Bath team, with colleagues from the University of Cambridge, had previously shown that low but significant gene activity begins soon after fertilisation.
Now, Dr Asami and Professor Perry have combined this new information with what is known from research elsewhere, to produce a unified plan.
âThis is a highly competitive area, but weâve been fortunate at Bath to have a facility that has enabled us to produce this roadmap of gene activity from the earliest moments after fertilisation,â said Professor Perry.
âOur new model does not yet give us an understanding of the starting conditions of human embryonic life, but it may provide a framework for doing so.â
The implications of this research extend beyond academic curiosity.
Understanding the earliest stages of gene activation could inform fertility treatment and shed light on the origin of adult disease, including cancer.

Understanding what lifestyle strategies can be effective for preventing and managing obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and metabolic syndrome is a public health priority.
Previous studies suggest that limiting how many carbohydrates we eat (from foods like pasta, bread, potatoes and sugar) can help with weight loss and improve certain aspects of health, such as blood sugar and fat levels.
It is still unknown whether shorter periods of restricting carbohydrates can have similar effects.
The study from the Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism aims to compare two diets that temporarily limit carbohydrate intake at different time frames to see if they work and, if they do, understand how.
We also hope to learn whether a new mobile phone application is useful in following diets like these and tracking progress.
We are looking for volunteers who:

Throughout the study, all documents will only contain your unique study code which you will be assigned if you enrol.
Any identifiable personal data will be kept on a password-protected file on the Universityâs servers, in accordance with the current UK Data Protection regulations.
This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by Newcastle and North Tyneside 2 research Ethics Committee (IRAS Project ID 323721).
Over the course of the study, you will take part in four lab visits, and complete a 4-week dietary intervention and a 4-week digital phase, while monitoring your lifestyle for a total of 10 weeks.
The visit will involve body measurements, collection of breath samples, and a 15-minute treadmill walk while measuring your heart rate and breathing.
Monitoring phase (2 weeks): Monitoring of your current lifestyle through wearable devices (such as a smartwatch, activity monitor and a continuous glucose monitor), food diaries and mobile applications.
Laboratory visit 2 (around 7.5 hours): We will start with body measurements, a body composition scan and collection of breath samples.
A fat sample will then be collected, and a cannula will be inserted into a vein so we can collect blood samples throughout the day.
You will then be asked to eat a breakfast meal (oatmeal with cream and sugar) drink after which we will regularly collect blood and breath samples for 5 hours, and ask you to complete a few questionnaires.
Dietary phase (4 weeks): We will ask you to follow one of the following diets for 4 weeks:
1) Restriction of carbohydrates on two days in a row each week
2) Restriction of carbohydrates after 4pm each day
3) No changes to your current diet
You will also be asked to continue monitoring your lifestyle throughout.
Laboratory visit 3 (around 7.5 hours): Identical as visit 2.
Digital phase (4 weeks): We will ask you to test out a mobile health-tracking application (âMetabolismâ) that provides education and recommendations tailored specifically to you, while continuing to monitor your lifestyle using a continuous glucose monitor and smartwatch.
Laboratory visit 4 (around 1.5 hours): The visit will involve body measurements, a body composition scan, a measure of blood pressure, and collection of a single blood sample.
Afterwards, we will carry out a 30-minute interview about your experience using the mobile health application.

You will also receive detailed feedback on your body composition, markers of metabolic health (e.g.
blood sugar and haemoglobin levels), physical activity levels and dietary intake.
We will present your results alongside the recommended ranges (where possible) and explain what they mean.
For example, you will receive information on the following: basal metabolic rate â How many calories your body burns at rest activity energy expenditure â How many calories you burn through physical activity body composition â How many kilograms of muscle and fat you have in your body energy intake â How many calories you eat/drink per day nutrient intake â How many grams of key nutrient to consume per day full blood count â A common blood test to measure the number and status of different blood cells blood sugar responses â How your blood sugar changes in response to meals, activity and other lifestyle factors

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/campaigns/help-us-research-how-exercise-plans-can-improve-health-for-people-with-cystic-fibrosis:
During this project, we want to gain insights into the potential effects of exercise on metabolic and cardiovascular health in adults with cystic fibrosis.
We know that with new breakthroughs in medication, people with cystic fibrosis are now living longer than ever.
However, with this increase in life expectancy, there appears to be an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
As such, we want to establish if a remote exercise intervention can help improve physical activity levels and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
We hope that this research study â titled 'Remote Exercise to Improve Physical Activity Levels and Markers of Heart Health in Cystic Fibrosis (RHH-CF)' â will keep people with cystic fibrosis as healthy for as long as possible as they grow older.
After conducting a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement meeting with the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in June 2024, we designed this research study to answer questions people with the disease need answers to in a way that is relevant for them.
As a result, the study is completely remote in design, and uses new technology â such as smart watches and remote capillary blood sampling tools â sent through the post.
Key information about taking part in this study.
Youâll be randomly assigned to one of two groups â a control group and an exercise intervention group.
If youâre in the intervention group, youâll be provided with a personalised exercise programme delivered and monitored using a smartwatch (Polar Ignite 2), and resistance bands to carry out at home with remote support.
If you're in the control group, you will continue with your regular daily routine.
However, you will have access to the programme and equipment after the second assessment (after eight weeks).
Before and after the exercise programme/control time, we will schedule two 45-minute calls with you to take some basic measurements, complete questionnaires, and take small blood samples using the remote sampling kits .
On successful completion of the study, youâll receive a copy of your data from the programme and a Â£50 Love2Shop voucher as compensation for your time.
You must be aged between 18 and 65 and have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.

Find out more about our study.
Within the UK it is estimated that there could be as many as 136,000 victims of modern slavery and human trafficking (Global Slavery Index, 2018).
Current research focuses on the individual needs of adult or child trafficking victims, however, there is a lack of research and understanding of the needs of parents who have been victims of human trafficking and modern slavery.
As survivors of human trafficking and modern slavery are diverse in their background and circumstances, it was decided to focus on one ethnicity.
After British nationals, in late 2020, the second most trafficked nationality were Albanian nationals (Home Office, 2021).
Previous research shows that Albanian survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking report they have faced unique challenges in healthcare and accessing support for their children.
For example, women have struggled to access GP services and report a lack of understanding around their legal entitlements to care (Dando et al, 2018).
This study aims to investigate the needs and experiences of Albanian mothers who have been victims of modern slavery and human trafficking living in the UK.
This study will interview Albanian women who have survived human trafficking and modern slavery to investigate how these women view their experiences of parenting and what areas of support they need.
We are recruiting for this study until September 2026.
An hour interview - an interpreter will be provided if needed.
Participants will NOT be asked about their experiences of trafficking and modern slavery.
Eligibility This study will focus on Albanian mothers aged 18 years and over, who are survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking (SMSHTs) and who have dependent children currently living with them.

The highly anticipated AKT programme Round 4 from Innovate UK returns to fund short-term collaborations between business partners and Universities to accelerate industry led research and innovation projects.
AKT4 Addiction Healthcare Goals (2025) funds the development of research projects relevant to the treatment, recovery, and harm prevention for those with drug and alcohol addictions.
Further information and scope can be found by following this link (Innovate UK).
The University of Bath had three successful AKT projects awarded from Innovate UK in the previous rounds, allowing industry partners to collaborate with world-leading experts on 3-4 month exploratory projects which are heavily subsidised, with Innovate UK funding up to 90% of project costs (total project amount in the region of Â£35k with a minimum 10% partner contribution expected, TBC).
The AKT programme has offered themed and open-call funding and has been recognised as one of the best-value funding mechanisms for developing partnerships between organisations and Universities.
The AKT between the University of Bath and health-tech company Mayden, reviewed and prototyped bias mitigation and explainability techniques for AI driven predictive tools for use in client management and clinician workflow.
The project, led by Dr Julian Padget in the Department of Computer Science, co-developed best practices within Mayden for the management of AI tools.
In addition, the AKT also transferred knowledge about bias, transparency, explanation, governance and oversight through the co-evolution of Maydenâs AI model development pipeline.
The focus of the project explored methods of understanding and dealing with AI bias which is particularly relevant to the health-tech industry when integrating AI into software and services.
By the end of the project, a module was being developed to integrate the results into Maydenâs software, providing meaningful predictive insights to their customers.
Alice Davis at Mayden says:
This partnership has established new processes and practices within Mayden for the development of safe and explainable AI tools and embedded hard to acquire technical knowledge within Maydenâs teams while strengthening our relationship with experts at the University of Bath.
The AKT with Alive Labs, a design company bringing healthier systems into our urban environment, investigated the mechanical properties of a novel cladding solution developed by the company, designed to have moss growing on its surface as a next-generation green wall.
The partnership, led by Dr Richard Ball with Jingbang Pan, and Mohamed Katish, from the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, was established to understand the inner chemistry of the cladding material for improved mechanical performance.
Alive Labs developed variations of their patented material over the course of the AKT, using the expertise and facilities at the University of Bath to test and validate the new prototype materials.
Each round focused on investigating a specific property of the material, such as porosity, strength, and carbon-negativity.
Dr Richard Ball says:
Alive Labs and the University of Bath worked together to develop a strong, carbon-negative, mix for use in bioreceptive cladding solutions.
Innovation was introduced via the use of naturally occurring substances which provide the required properties, whilst also lowering the embodied carbon of the final cladding product.
The AKT has accelerated Alive Labsâ development of passive green air purification and cladding systems that can thermally regulate and clean the air that we breathe, reducing the need for mechanical ventilation and improving societal health and wellbeing.
Successful deployment of the innovation developed in this AKT has allowed the business to become a significant player in the UK and global cladding markets.
Architen Landrell is a specialist tensile fabric company for some of the worldâs most inspiring architectural membrane structures.
Their clients need to understand risk and plan a replacement strategy for structures which are approaching âend of lifeâ.
Potential degradation could result from UV, environmental conditions, bacteria or algae activity, and chemically aggressive environments.
To explore this, they were awarded an AKT with the University of Bath led by Dr Richard Ball with Paul Romain and Afi Khorramshokouh, Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering.
Partners explored the feasibility of developing a handheld instrument for non-invasive, site-based inspections of structural membrane materials to inform residual life expectancy.
The outcome of the AKT has uncovered new insight on degradation processes and low-cost mobile solutions for visual inspection with adequate resolutions that are fit for purpose.
The team also identified the significant potential for AI techniques to be integrated into the assessment for shaping future developments through interpreting large amounts of data.
Capturing relevant data from existing structures is now embedded within Architenâs inspection and maintenance methodologies.

This city is an incredible place to build a business, and Iâm proud to say weâve proven that a startup from Bath can take on the world.â
Courtney won an Alumni Innovation Award at the University, supported by alumnus His Excellency Khalil Foulathi, to help grow his business idea.
Courtney describes the ârelentless effortâ it has taken over many years to achieve his success, battling for âelusive growth.â He relays one âparticularly painful momentâ when he spent Â£1,000 to put on an exclusive event at a wine bar, offering free wine and tapas in a bid to win over a major Bristol accounting firm.
âOnly one person turned up,â he recalled.
âIt was the most embarrassing day of my life.â
By early 2020, Courtney had resigned himself to the business failing.
A 2020 Crowdcube raise provided crucial funding, but COVID-19 hit just as the round closed.
With restaurants closed and the business burning over Â£25,000 per month, Courtney, with his team on furlough, moved back home to his family home in Bristol, assuming it was the end.
But over lockdown, Courtney rethought his strategy and decided to pivot away from direct consumer downloads, to work in partnership with businesses and their customer bases.
By 2021 this had paid off and Lux Rewards signed a major deal with Barclaycard, expanding from 1,000 users to over 400,000 overnight.
British Airways and Mastercard soon followed, expanding their offers across the global loyalty market.
Today, Lux Rewards reaches over 105 million cardholders worldwide and has achieved 4x year-on-year revenue growth.
Siobain Hone, Graduate Enterprise Manager, who was behind Courtneyâs student enterprise experience, said: âI am absolutely delighted to see James sell the business he started whilst he was an undergraduate - if anyone was going to make a success of things it was always going to be him.
"Supporting him through our student enterprise programme and watching him making the most of every opportunity, we knew James was going to make his idea work.
I'm proud to have been a small part of that journey and he has been a fantastic ambassador for Enterprise Bath and a real pleasure to work with.
I can't wait to see what he does next and this time I'm going to invest!â
Becky Gallagher, Head of MBA Recruitment and Admissions, added: "We are really proud to have welcomed James back to the School of Management as an executive MBA student and to play a part in developing his future business endeavours.
The Bath MBA is an opportunity for students to learn from leading experts as well as each other, and James' entrepreneurial successes are a real asset."
The MBA team is holding an Executive MBA Open House Event on 14 March at the University of Bath campus.
Courtney and his co-founders Tom Munday and Ash Dey are now focused on growing Lux Rewards under Enigmatic Smile but are not ruling out future ventures together.
Enterprise Bath offers students advice, business mentors, competitions, masterclasses, talks from expert guest speakers, placements, and networking opportunities.

The UKâs first fully recyclable 3G pitch will be officially opened at the University of Bath today.
Professor Phil Taylor, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University, is set to mark the opening by taking the first kick on the pitch following a ceremony attended by representatives of the University, The SU Bath (Studentsâ Union), local sporting clubs including Bath City FC, and Bristol-based contractors Verde.
The completed facility complies with FIFA, World Rugby and Sport England standards, which ensures quality, performance, safety and the best possible experience for players.
The artificial turf chosen is manufactured without latex and utilises the same polymer throughout, meaning the pitch can be fully reprocessed at the end of its life rather than go to landfill.
Instead of traditional rubber crumb, an engineered wood-particle infill has been chosen to provide natural cushioning and grip on the playing surface.
This is a natural, biodegradable product which reduces the reliance on synthetic materials and waste.
The high-performance shock-pad underneath the pitch, which provides a cushioning layer between the turf and the ground, is designed for full-cycle recycling and can be reused multiple times.
The pitch surrounds have been developed to be environmentally friendly and considerate of important local wildlife habitats, with 4m wooden fencing providing an acoustic barrier and significantly reducing light spill to protect bats in the neighbouring countryside.
Floodlights for the 100mx70m pitch and the adjoining multi-use games area (MUGA) and existing 3G training strip, are controlled by an app, and so can be quickly and remotely turned off when the facilities are not in use.
The development of sustainable facilities is a fundamental part of the University of Bathâs commitment to sustainability and tackling climate change .
The University continues to deliver meaningful action to minimise the environmental impact of its operations and to support and enable a sustainable community.
Professor Phil Taylor, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Bath, said: "The addition of this new recyclable 3G pitch supports our world-class sporting facilities, and will create enhanced opportunities for our students, staff and the community to take part in sport and be active at the Team Bath Sports Training Village.
âBy bringing together a range of materials, technologies and design measures selected to reduce its impact on local wildlife, the environment and over its lifetime through end-of-life recyclability, the pitch is a fantastic illustration of our profound focus on sustainability at the University of Bath.â
The provision of the new pitch has long been identified as an essential part of the Universityâs strategy for enhancing its sports facilities and maintaining its reputation for elite sport , its provision to students, and its role in the wider community.
The all-weather surface and floodlights will allow more student sport to be played year-round, and the facility is available to book on a pay-and-play basis for all customer groups, including the public.
The company behind the groundbreaking design and build is Verde , a firm founded in 2008 with the goal of providing sustainable and innovative solutions for artificial sports pitch design, construction and maintenance.
Director Jonathan Bland said: âWe are incredibly proud to have worked in partnership with the University of Bath to provide this vital facility, which will help develop the next generation of athletes.
Itâs been a real team effort to gain planning permission and bring the project to fruition.
We look forward to seeing the positive impact this facility will have on our community.â
The University of Bath is renowned as one of the countryâs leading sporting institutions and is one of just eight UK Sport-accredited Elite Training Centres, helping Team GB and ParalympicsGB athletes to achieve their full performance potential.
Athletes training at the University have won 85 Olympic and Paralympic medals since 1996 across sports as diverse as athletics, bobsleigh, modern pentathlon, skeleton and swimming.
More than 1,500 students represent the University and The SU Bath in regional and national student sports competition, and the Team Bath Sports Training Village facilities are also open to the public.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/future-of-rugby-report-uncovers-rugbys-social-impact-around-the-world:
Ahead of the first match of the Rugby World Cup 2023 (RWC23) this weekend, a new report released today by Mastercard and the University of Bath reveals how rugby is set for a significant growth in global followers by 2025.
'The Future of Rugby' report - authored by sports scientists from the University's Department for Health - identifies key ways through which rugby is positively impacting society around the globe, acting as a 'force for good' through inclusivity, health, education, the fan experience and sustainability.
Coinciding with the 200th anniversary of the sport and across these themes, the report features exclusive interviews conducted by University of Bath researchers with rugby legends and Mastercard ambassadors Dan Carter , SÃ©bastien Chabal , Maggie Alphonsi , Safi N'Diaye , Bryan Habana and Portia Woodman-Wickliffe , plus a host of personal stories of innovators from around the world doing remarkable work to drive the game forward.
Drawing on data from World Rugby and from Nielsen , it forecasts a 10% growth in global followers and fans of rugby by 2025, along with a 17% increase in participation in this World Cup year.
For each social impact trend identified, the report suggests a focus for the future, led by the current examples making a difference today.
Inclusivity : By 2027, the report predicts the top ten ranked rugby nations will all hold national festivals or competitions focused on the participation of individuals with disabilities.
Female participation levels are also at an all-time high, totalling 2.7 million players globally, a +28% increase in registered female players since 2017 .
Elsewhere, growth in participation is also being seen in wheelchair rugby, with the sport now played in around 40 countries across the world since its inception less than 50 years ago.
Health : Player associations and rugby-based charities are leading the charge in destigmatising mental health through rugby, particularly amongst men â using the sport as a vehicle to promote better physical and mental health.
Rugby is starting to be viewed as a safer sport than it was in 2021, with a 10% increase in fans in emerging markets believing the sport has been made safer.
Education :  Across the world, rugby is being used as a force for good to drive better educational outcomes and empowerment, in particular for young people.
The report suggests that even more should be done to champion small-scale projects already making a difference, such as the UmRio in Brazil, or the VUSA Rugby Academy in South Africa.
Fan Experience : World Rugbyâs commitments to growing the gameâs global influence amongst fans has led to a 32% increase in interest in emerging rugby nations â two-thirds also see the game as more exciting .
The report presents ideas for growing the gameâs influence among fans, such as through in-stadia live analytics, the roll-out of VR technology and player holograms.
Sustainability : Rugby can play a positive role in responding to climate change, with World Rugby leading by example being one of the first international federations to sign the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and launching its own World Rugby Environmental Sustainability Plan 2030 .
The report predicts that by 2027, 50% of clubs in elite competitions around the world will be signatories to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework, each pledging ambitious actions.
To bring to life the five key areas identified as driving the growth in the game, Mastercard has assembled a team of remarkable individuals who are shaping the future of the sport: the Future XV .
This squad of pioneers, selected with assistance from the University of Bath and international stars of the game, each embody the positive changes being made for rugbyâs future growth, championing activity at all levels of the game, from grassroots to professional, in countries from all around the world.
Commenting on the report, lead author and rugby science specialist Professor Keith Stokes , said: âThe report and the Future XV squad uncover extraordinary people and organisations working hard to create positive change at all levels of the game.
"On rugbyâs 200th anniversary, now is the time to celebrate these innovators as well as all that rugby has achieved, but also to build on that to propel the sport forwards into the decades ahead.
That means rugby continuing to innovate to attract more people into the sport, demonstrating its positive influence in society, and taking a lead on key issues.
âGuided by rugbyâs core principles of solidarity and respect, we hope this report can act as a springboard that helps to drive lasting and impactful change, which in turn will help ensure rugby continues to be a force for good in the years ahead.â
Raja Rajamannar, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer of Mastercard, added: âThis year, we celebrate 200 years of rugby.
And while itâs a chance to look back, itâs more importantly an opportunity to look ahead to the next 200 years of the game.
As sponsor of the menâs and womenâs Rugby World Cups, and programmes like Women in Rugby, weâve seen the incredible passion rugby evokes among players and fans alike.
Mastercard is proud to be part of the legacy of this great sport â and to invest in rugbyâs bright future.â
Alan Gilpin, World Rugby Chief Executive said: âThis year, we are celebrating 200 years of rugby, and it is an important moment to reflect, challenge and harness the pioneering spirit of our beginnings to shape a bright future for our sport.
From promoting inclusion and diversity to fostering a sense of community, rugby has the power to bring people together and create positive social change.
This fascinating Mastercard 'Future of Rugby' report does more than simply bring this to life, but it demonstrates that we have the passion and expertise to continue to move forward to shape a better game and set a positive example.â
The Future of Rugby report, authored by the University of Bath between July and August 2023, features research and findings from a variety of sources including World Rugby, Nielsen, the Mastercard Sports Economy Index and interviews with case study organisations and individuals.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/study-highlights-open-goal-of-using-sport-to-tackle-youth-unemployment:
A new report is calling on the Government to capitalise on the role that sport can play in helping unemployed young people from disadvantaged backgrounds around the UK move into sustained work and training.
Authored by researchers at the University of Bath and published during national Youth Work Week, the âActive for Employmentâ report is the second in a series commissioned by the Sport for Development Coalition aimed at demonstrating to policy-makers how targeted sport and physical activity-based interventions can help to tackle health and societal inequalities in under-served communities - ultimately producing multiple cost savings to the public purse.
The Coalition is a growing UK-wide movement of organisations and networks using sport to intentionally generate positive health and societal outcomes.
These range from improved mental wellbeing and social cohesion to reducing anti-social behaviour, crime and unemployment.
The University of Bath report authors â Dr Haydn Morgan , Dr Anthony Bush and Dr Harry Bowles â are specialists in sport development and policy.
Covid-19 and the ensuing cost-of-living crisis have profoundly impacted employment, education and training in the UK, with the effects felt most acutely among young people aged 16 to 24.
As economic inactivity rises, over 600,000 people are currently not seeking work â nearly a third of whom (28%) are from âGeneration Zâ.
For this group, underemployment â employment in low-skill, low-paying or part-time jobs â also remains problematic.
The report makes a series of key recommendations focused on sportâs ability to attract and engage young people beyond formal education and training systems, building networks with employers and developing a fit-for-purpose workforce for the sport for development sector.
The latter is especially relevant in view of the role that youth work plays in âsport for developmentâ - the notion of bringing about social changes through the use of sport.
Examples of good practice highlighted in the report include Bath Rugby Foundation and Premiership Rugbyâs HITZ programme to support young peopleâs wellbeing and mental health and their transitions into employment through their engagement with sport and physical activity.
Others include the English Football Leagueâs initiative to create stronger, healthier and more active communities, working with the Department for Work & Pensions to provide opportunities to enhance employability and support employment in the sports sector.
Associate Professor in Sport Management at the University of Bathâs Department for Health, Haydn Morgan , who led the research explained: âAgainst a multitude of challenges that young people growing up in Britain currently face, our report sets out how sport and physical activity can play a vital role in helping to keep them on track and to succeed in terms of their employability and life goals.
âCrucially, it highlights that sport for development organisations, which use sport as a vehicle to bring about wider changes in peopleâs lives, play a vital role in connecting young people with employment pathways â especially those furthest from the employment market with relatively low investment.
âWe need to ensure sustained investment continues in the sector to ensure this vital work can continue.â
Hitesh Patel , Executive Director for the Coalition, said: âWith the UK now contending with a cost-of-living crisis, it is vital that we mobilise all societal assets that can help tackle inequalities and generate cost savings.
Sport for development is one of those assets, and we hope that this important research will help to demonstrate to policy-makers the value of targeted sport and physical activity-based interventions within communities facing the greatest disadvantage and deprivation.â
Along with primary research, Active for Employment features more than 50 submissions of learning and evidence from across the Coalitionâs growing UK-wide network, and follows âMoving for Mental Healthâ which was published in January 2022.
The reports support the Coalitionâs #OpenGoal framework which aims to demonstrate the role of sport for development in building a fairer, more equitable and sustainable future.
The research which underpins the report was supported by five Coalition members: London Youth, Premiership Rugby, Sports Leaders UK, StreetGames and Street League.
Throughout 2023, Coalition members will be working collectively to produce further reports and evidence to support the #OpenGoal framework, showing how targeted sport-based interventions can help to close the gap in education and development, reduced crime and anti-social behaviour, and play a key role in building stronger communities and social cohesionâ.
Last week the Ministry of Justice announced that the Coalition, along with its network members StreetGames and Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice, would oversee the distribution of a new Â£5million fund aimed at preventing young people becoming involved in crime and anti-social behaviour.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/imi-provides-consultancy-for-the-fa-to-formulate-improbable-wins-in-third-round-of-emirates-fa-cup:
The Institute for Mathematical Innovation (IMI) at the University of Bath is a hub of world-leading mathematicians who work with industry and external organisations to apply mathematics for solving challenging problems.
The Third Round of the Emirates FA Cup has become synonymous with results that defy logic throughout the competitions 150-year history.
To explore this further, IMI worked with The FA to verify a historical top 10 of the least likely scorelines from the last 50 years of the competition.
Using probability theory, Professor Andreas Kyprianou, Director of the IMI, and Dr Adwaye Rambojun, Research Associate at the IMI, developed a mathematical model that takes into account the overall probability of the lower league teams reaching the Third Round, the difference in league status and the timing and sequence of the goals scored in each tie.
More on their research .
Dr Rambojun said:
Using data from over 8,000 Emirates FA Cup matches, we produced a mathematical model that takes into account not only the relative league status of the teams involved and how many matches they won to get there but also in-game scoring sequences to compute the total probability of the biggest third round giant-killings in the last 50 years.
Our findings show that there is only one winner when it comes to the most improbable third round shock.â
Speaking of Wokingâs most improbable 4-2 win against West Bromwich Albion in 1991 he continued:
The conditions surrounding Wokingâs win had probability stacked against them but, somehow, they managed to produce a result that would likely happen only once every 15,959,312 attemptsâ¦Itâs an outcome that defies logic but, as our ranking proves, on any given day the unthinkable can happen.
Thatâs the magic of the Emirates FA Cup and we have seen it time and again throughout the competitionâs illustrious history.â
Andy Ambler, Director of Professional Game Relations at The FA, added:
The commissioned research outlines the competitionâs ability to regularly defy logic and will hopefully spark many fond memories.
In its 150th anniversary season, the Emirates FA Cup retains the values of hope, opportunity and equality.
Improbable results are part of the competitionâs fabric, providing life changing moments for players, managers, fans and communities alike and I am sure there will be plenty more to come as the competition looks ahead to an exciting future.
The FA distributed their announcement highlighting the collaboration with the IMI on the most improbable FA Cup Third Round scorelines to national, local and regional media ahead of this yearâs competition.
The story generated coverage in titles such as the Daily Mail , The Sun , Daily Mirror and Daily Star , and was supported by interviews with Dr Rambojun for talkSPORT, BBC Radio Wiltshire and BBC Radio Bristol.
Consultancy Services in Research and Innovation Services (RIS) at the University of Bath works with academics to provide guidance on consultancy, such as expert advice to businesses and external organisations.
Speaking of the support from Consultancy Services in RIS, Professor Kyprianou says:
I was extremely impressed with Consultancy Services who helped facilitate our research with the FA.
They liaised with all the relevant stakeholders from the onset and provided an instantaneous process, enabling us to start working with the FA as soon as possible.
Julie Chambers, Consultancy Services Manager, who provides consultancy support to academics throughout the project life-cycle, says:
We are delighted to see this high-profile research from the IMI generate increasing interest and evidence early-stage impact, highlighting the benefits of consultancy to other researchers and organisations.
This is a brilliant example of how academic research can be applied to the real-world and provide insight into challenges for a range of valued partners such as The FA.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/case-studies/how-the-university-of-bath-is-supporting-british-athletes-to-succeed-at-the-olympic-winter-games:
Nestled away by the fields beyond the Universityâs Sports Training Village stands a unique sight in the UK.
Inconspicuously located behind a row of trees is our 140-metre outdoor push-start track â the only one of its type in the country â dedicated to helping Britainâs Skeleton athletes hone their starting technique away from the ice.
Itâs now 20 years since the push-start track, originally built after Team Bath successfully bid for National Lottery funding , opened back in 2002: the start of a long-term, partnership with the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA), the governing body for British Skeleton which is now also based on campus alongside the English Institute of Sport , another of the Universityâs partners.
In the two decades since, Skeletonâs Bath-based winter Olympians have gone on to achieve world-beating performances at successive Winter Olympic Games, totalling seven medals since 2002 and winning 50% of the available medals at the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018.
For the winter sport where athletes launch themselves head-first, face down on a sled to race at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour down an ice track, Alex Coomber was the first athlete to taste medal success, taking bronze at Salt Lake City (2002).
Next came Shelley Rudman, who claimed silver in Torino (2006), before University graduate (now also Honorary Graduate ), Amy Williams, made history with a stunning gold in Vancouver (2010).
Amyâs victory was followed by a golden double for Lizzy Yarnold, who not only took the crown in Sochi (2014), but four years later successfully defended her title at PyeongChang (2018), alongside teammates Laura Deas and Dom Parsons (a PhD student at the time) both claiming bronze.
As this yearâs Winter Olympics skeleton competition gets underway in Beijing from 10 â 12 February, followed by the bobsleigh from 13 â 20 February, all eyes will be on the British team and the athletes who train at Bath.
Behind the scenes though is an equally impressive story of research and innovation as British Skeleton seeks to evolve and retain its level of success.
The last decade has seen a strong relationship develop between British Skeleton and sports scientists based in the Universityâs Department for Health and Centre for the Analysis of Motion, Entertainment Research and Applications (CAMERA) to help underpin coaching processes.
Dr Steffi Colyer started her research career just over a decade ago, working with British Skeletonâs Danny Holdcroft (then head of Start Performance and now Head of Innovation and Applied Research) as part of her PhD in the lead up to the Sochi 2014 Games.
Her work focused on adding strength and data to what was then a programme based on experience and subjective coaching opinion and direction.
Coaches have been helped to support athletes achieve gains at the start of their run as a result, something which can make the difference between gaining a place on the podium or not.
As she explains: âAlthough the major championships are decided across four runs, which usually equates to around 4 minutes of sliding, the difference between gold and silver, or ending up on or off the podium can be a matter of milliseconds.
In the past weâve seen winning margins attributed to differences at the start â including Lizzyâs gold-winning margin in Sochi â and so British Skeleton has put much emphasis into enhancing this part of the race.
âThe start provides the only opportunity for athletes to accelerate the sled (above acceleration due to gravity) and from there it comes down to how best you can minimise energy losses by driving the sled well.
Getting the highest velocity possible at the start is often vital to a successful run.â
Much of Dr Colyer and her colleaguesâ work has sought to answer questions posed by the sports coaches - and particularly Holdcroft - with a focus on learning lessons from science research into the sprint start in athletics, and to apply this to the ice.
Some of the latest EPSRC-funded research draws on computer science expertise from CAMERA in which British Skeleton is a key partner and has resulted in the development of a non-invasive markerless motion capture technology to help coaches accurately measure athletesâ push start performances.
As part of this research, the Bath team used a set-up of nine cameras along both sides of the push-track, creating a markerless system, and compared measurements with those obtained via conventional methods allowing the researchers to capture athlete data âin the wildâ, says collaborator Dr Laurie Needham from CAMERA who developed the technology with Dr Murray Evans .
As Laurie explains: âThe non-invasive nature of this approach means that we can capture important push-start information without interfering with the athleteâs training session.
Our AI-driven technology allows for fully automated data processing and information is shared with coaches via a cloud-based web application.â
For Steffi Colyer this approach has huge potential for future sports biomechanics: âConventional âmarker-basedâ technologies, which we use every day in our laboratory research, are not feasible in many elite sports training and competition environments, so the future of sports biomechanics likely lies in finding accurate and unobtrusive markerless solutions.
Our system can provide information about British skeleton athletesâ start performances that was previously inaccessible to the coaches.â
Watch Laurie Needham's presentation all about this work .
Building on this work, British Skeleton part-funded and committed to embedding University PhD student, Mike Muckelt , fully into their performance programme.
This project is now using CAMERAâs markerless technologies to further enhance the sportâs knowledge of the skeleton push-start, with a focus on medal potential in both Milano Cortina 2026 and the yet to be decided 2030 Olympic Games.
The collaboration with British Skeleton and with athletes based on campus is helping to generate real impacts in terms of Bathâs sports science research.
âSuch a long-standing relationship is quite rare in research and has allowed us to truly understand British Skeletonâs needs and how we can help them to achieve their goalsâ, says Dr Colyer.
âThe combination of facilities and research expertise at Bath is unique, but that wouldnât be enough without the positive relationship that both sides have invested into over the years.
Having a real understanding of each otherâs goals and needs is something that doesnât come without investment of time and effort from both parties.
We continue to be grateful for British Skeletonâs enthusiasm towards our projects and the shared vision we have.â
For British Skeleton this feeling is mutual.
As Danny Holdcroft, Head of Performance Innovation and Applied Research at the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association, says: âOur continuing relationship with the University of Bath is something that we hold in high regard and value greatly as we seek to support our athlete aspirations of winning Olympic Gold Medals in 2022, 2026 and 2030.
The CAMERA project is an exciting piece of our larger jigsaw and will undoubtedly help us further explore beyond our current performance boundaries.â

A new review , recently published in the American Journal of Physiology Endocrinology and Metabolism from researchers in the Universityâs Department for Health , focuses on the importance of the liverâs glycogen stores in maintaining blood sugar levels during exercise.
It recommends fuelling up on carbohydrates both before and during exercise in order to prevent a decline in liver glycogen and to help maintain blood sugar control and delay fatigue.
Glycogen is the bodyâs main energy source for exercising at race pace and is stored when we consume carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates are an essential fuel source for high-intensity exercise.
When energy is needed during exercise, muscle and liver glycogen stores are broken down to provide extra fuel.
When these stores are depleted, we âhit the wallâ and have to reduce our running pace.
The new paper from researchers at Bath, âLiver glycogen metabolism during and after prolonged endurance-type exerciseâ , suggests that even when individuals are full to begin with, their glycogen stores will diminish more quickly when exercising at race pace when compared to a slow jog.
This is particularly true for events that last between 90 minutes to two hours, such as a Half Marathon.
When glycogen stores in the liver are critically low, blood sugar levels drop and a runnerâs pace will slow dramatically.
Lead author, Dr Javier Gonzalez , explained: âIn reviewing all the available evidence, we found that when exercising at race pace, people use up the glycogen stores in their liver relatively quickly but by ingesting carbohydrates during exercise at around 60 grams per hour, we can prevent this decline.
We also found that people who had done a lot of endurance training are able to use their liver glycogen more sparingly, delaying the depletion of this important fuel source.
âThis is important because low liver glycogen stores are strongly linked to both early fatigue and low blood sugar levels.
Therefore, ingesting carbohydrates during races can help delay fatigue and maintain adequate blood sugar availability for the muscle to use as a fuel.â
Practical food sources rich in carbohydrates that can help boost glycogen levels during a race include bananas and raisins, as well as sports drinks or energy gels.
60 grams per hour is a significant amount of carbohydrate, equivalent to around three bananas.
Leading up to the event, the day before, the researchers suggest loading up on potatoes, rice, pasta and fruit.
Further information
The latest study builds on previous work the team have been involved in, comparing the impact of consuming glucose and sucrose on liver glycogen levels for endurance athletes.

Former footballer and Team Bath FC manager Paul Tisdaleâs exceptional contribution to the sport has been formally recognised with an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Bath.â¯
As head coach of Team Bath FC, Paul led his side to the first round of the FA Cup in the 2002/03 season, which was the first time a university team had reached that stage of the competition since 1881.
Bath awards honorary fellowships to individuals who have made a significant impact in their field and have a strong affiliation with the University.
Now Head of Football Operations at Celtic FC, Paulâs career as both a player and a manager has often been linked to the South West.
After spells as a player with Bristol City, Yeovil Town and Exeter City, he graduated to full-time management.
He spent 12 successful years as manager of Exeter City and was fundamental in building one of the English Football Leagueâs most sustainable clubs during his tenure.
At the time of his departure, Paul was the longest serving manager in the top four divisions of the game in England, having spent 12 years in charge of the Devon club.
Speaking about his honorary fellowship, Paul said:
I am delighted to receive my honorary title from the University of Bath.
I would not have progressed into a coaching career if it were not for the opportunity I was afforded at Bath.
I consider my time at the University to be the perfect âcoaching apprenticeshipâ, working alongside elite coaches from different sports, whilst learning about the benefits of analytics and sports science.
Most of all, my time at Bath helped me recognise the hugely positive influence a conducive environment can have on the development of a young sportsperson.
Speaking about Paul, Dr Anthony Bush from Bathâs Department for Health said:
With the average English football managerâs length of service being around one year, it is testament to Paulâs expertise, ability to innovate his practice and manage a multiplicity of complex relationships that he has had such longevity in the technical area.
Placing the athlete at the centre of his practice has enabled Paul to have success on the field, but for me it is witnessing the considerable impact of the alumni from the football programme which emphasises his outstanding contribution to the vision of the University.
We look forward to continuing our relationship with Paul to further the general mission of the University.
Paul started his footballing journey with Southampton, representing the Saints in the Premier League.
He also spent time playing in Greece and Finland.
His coaching career began with Team Bath in 1999 and ended in 2022 with a spell at Stevenage.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-researchers-lead-discussions-into-reducing-concussions-in-youth-and-community-sport:
More than 100 researchers, athletes, clinicians, policy makers, teachers and industrial partners took part in the 2nd annual UK Concussion Prevention Network conference.
The event, which took place at Twickenham Stadium in April, explored how evidence has been used to develop policy around concussion prevention across sports and how it can be used more effectively in the future.
It was led by academics from the Edinburgh - Bath Research Centre (named the UK Collaborating Centre on Injury and Illness Prevention in Sport (UKCCIIS) ), which includes staff from Bathâs Centre for Health, and Injury & Illness Prevention in Sport (CHi2PS) , as well as representatives from Leeds Beckett University and University of Calgary (Canada).
The conference, hosted by the charity Love of The Game , is part of the UK Concussion Prevention Networkâs mission to reduce concussions in the UK for youth and community sports by 30% by 2030 through new policy, training and equipment interventions.
Dr Rod Hebden, CEO of Love of the Game, said:
Having brought the group together, weâre proud to be able to continue to support the network, which is tackling such an important challenge.
Weâre dedicated to creating a future where everyone can enjoy all the huge benefits which sport brings, without the fear of long-term impacts of concussions.
This network recognises that the best concussion is the one that never happens, and has set clear targets for measuring and reducing the incidence of concussion across all sports in the UK from grassroots to elite athletes.
Itâs a challenge we can only tackle if we work together, and this conference is an important step towards that.
Attendees discussed approaches to preventing instances of concussion within the likes of rugby, ice hockey, basketball, para football disciplines, cricket, cycling and wheelchair rugby.
By facilitating cross-sport discussion, the goal is for primary prevention strategies to be developed to reduce concussions throughout community and youth sport.
With youth athletes a specific focus of the network, a dedicated session on protecting young people included great insights from Kevin Morris, Assistant Head Teacher at Beechen Cliff School in Bath.
Speaking at the event, Kevin said:
Itâs amazing to see the knowledge and understanding that has been developed over the last 20 years underpinned by research done by the practitioners in the room."
It has allowed coaches and educators to make better decisions in how to design training, advise young athletes and also aid in any recuperation.
A notable session saw Professor Carolyn Emery - an internationally recognised injury epidemiologist and physiotherapist based at the University of Calgary and Global Chair at the University of Bath in 2022/23 - discuss concussion prevention education resources.
Acknowledging that primary prevention is the main focus of the network, the importance of education for identification and management of concussion was highlighted, with reference to the UK-wide concussion guidance for grassroots sport .
Keith Stokes , Professor of Applied Physiology at the University of Bath and Medical Research Lead at the Rugby Football Union, added:
The focus on engaging stakeholders at this yearâs conference provided the network with incredible insight into the real-world challenges and opportunities in the goal to reduce concussions.
The lessons from this conference will help to shape the networkâs future activities.
Attendees heard real-world stories from former and current athletes from elite and community sport, including current University of Bath Studentsâ Union (SU) Sport Officer Abbie Watkin , who said:
It was great to input my voice from a community sport background to enlighten an audience who may not have heard this perspective before.
There is also plenty from the day that I can take back to the SU to implement improvements in our own sport provision and improve safety within what we offer.

Researchers from the Centre for Health, and Injury & Illness Prevention in Sport (CHi2PS) led a number of sessions at the IOC World Conference on Prevention of Injury and Illness in Sport in Monaco earlier this month.
The triennial event, which took place for the seventh time, brings together leading global experts to share the latest research in athlete health, and injury and illness prevention.
CHi2PS members, whose research focuses on improving the safety and welfare of athletes across all levels of sport, delivered 26 sessions across the event.
These explored a range of topics, including injury surveillance and prevention in cricket, dance, football, horse racing and rugby; as well as injuries in youth populations, the influence of gendered environments on injury, and LGBTQI+ athlete health and protection.
The role of different analytical methodologies, including machine learning, in sports injury prevention research were also explored in a series of workshops delivered by the team.
Professor Keith Stokes gave a keynote lecture titled âInjury Prevention in Rugby: the past, the present and the futureâ, in which he described 20 years of work from colleagues at the University of Bath.
He referenced research that has influenced the laws of the game relating to scrum engagement (you can watch a video about this research at the bottom of this page), and the development of an injury prevention exercise programme that has been rolled out globally by World Rugby.
He also described more recent work from within Bath to evaluate laws around tackle height in rugby, and ongoing research - in partnership with England Rugby, Premiership Rugby and Premiership Womenâs Rugby - into using mouthguards with embedded sensors to measure head accelerations.
Speaking after the event, Professor Stokes said:
This event is the major academic conference in our field, and it is fantastic that we have made such a prominent contribution to the scientific programme.
This was a real opportunity to showcase the breadth and depth of our research in injury and illness prevention in sport, and highlighted our commitment to making sports safer for athletes ranging from young to old and recreational to elite.
Dr Carly McKay , Co-Director of CHi2PS, added:
It is so exciting to see UK researchers on the world stage, recognised as international leaders in injury and illness prevention in sport.
We are part of a global community that is trying to make sport safer, and this conference was an excellent opportunity to share our hard-earned knowledge and learn from other leaders in the field.
CHi2PS partners with colleagues at the University Edinburgh to form the UKâs IOC Research Centre in athlete health and injury prevention , named the UK Collaborating Centre on Injury and Illness Prevention in Sport (UKCCIIS).
Members of UKCCIIS made a major contribution to the conference, delivering 38 different presentations spread across the scientific programme.

Dr Lee Bryant , a biogeochemist from the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, is working with Professor Gideon Wolfaardt, a microbiologist and Director of the Stellenbosch University Water Institute (SUWI) .
They are working together to better understand a common threat affecting water security worldwide.
The Limpopo province is an agriculturally rich area in northern South Africa responsible for growing and exporting large amounts of food produce.
Farms in the region are supplied with water from the Lower Blyde River irrigation system, which stems from the Blyderivierpoort reservoir.
The piping network is vital for food production yet is vulnerable to blockages that reduce its flow and supply.
The cause of the blockages is due to the amount of manganese (Mn) in the water, a problem that affects water plants on a global scale.
The geology of the region causes high levels of manganese in the reservoir.
Biofilms in the water draw on the abundant source of manganese to respire and grow.
This material forms on surfaces and reduces pipe diameter by approximately 25%.
The impact on water supplies in the area threatens both food production and drinking water quality.
The research collaboration between Bath and Stellenbosch will explore the conditions that cause manganese biofilms to build up.
The findings will add weight to future decisions on how to manage blockages more efficiently, both economically and environmentally.
The project will focus on two stages: fieldwork at the Blyderivierpoort reservoir and experimental work in laboratories at both universities.
Professor Wolfaardt and Dr Bryant will lead a research team to collect water and sediment samples from the reservoir starting in May 2016.
These will be collected regularly to see how seasonal changes impact the accumulation of manganese.
Dr Bryant visited Professor Wolfaardt at Stellenbosch last month to develop biofilm experiments in support of the fieldwork this summer.
Findings from the project will lead to a better understanding of the characteristics of manganese biofilms.
The results will be used to influence processes that ensure a more stabilised water flow and supply in the pipe network at Blyderivierpoort reservoir.
They will also have a wider impact, informing approaches to manganese problems in water management and treatment worldwide.
The research is funded by the University of Bath and Stellenbosch University.
Dr Bryant received two University of Bath international mobility grants worth Â£20,000 to develop the project in collaboration with partner institute, Stellenbosch University.

For many English footballers, the journey to a place on the national team begins in Premier League football academies.
But home-grown talent doesn't always rise to the top.
Players like David Beckham and Steven Gerrard were part of England's 'Golden Generation', but failed to deliver international trophies.
As that generation slips into retirement, the country is searching for new talent.
The 2014 World Cup squad featured promising young players like Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley.
But the team slunk out of the competition after three matches, two goals and placing last in the group.
English players account for less time played in their top home league than their German and Spanish counterparts.
Both the Premier League and its fans are keen to nourish a new generation of talented home-grown players.
But we may be missing out on some of our best potential talent.
Late developers like Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona have become some of the most successful players of all time.
But for many talented footballers, a slow start for puberty can mean they struggle to succeed in the academy system.
Teenagers mature at different rates, and children of the same age can vary greatly in biological maturity.
When young footballers are 12 to 15 years old, the difference in physical maturity between players is at its widest.
Early-maturing boys are almost adults, while late-maturing boys are still in the initial stages of puberty.
With strength and speed on their side, early maturers have a major advantage as clubs decide which young players will make the cut.
Countries who prize technical skills over physical styles of play are less likely to favour early maturers.
But the physical nature of the English game means late bloomers struggle compared to their larger peers.
Strength and speed aren't the only advantages of early puberty.
Players are spotted earlier and experience success more often.
They receive more support, encouragement and access to coaching and training resources.
They also have the opportunity to compete at the highest levels.
And late developers aren't just at a physical disadvantage, but a psychological one.
Facing down one of their fully-grown peers on the pitch, a smaller player can doubt their own ability to compete.
The focus on physical ability can also be a disadvantage for early-maturing footballers.
Coaches and scouts may believe that early physical advantages will carry on through adulthood.
This creates unrealistic expectations for a young player's potential.
By age 18, physical differences between players have usually evened out.
Late developers can eventually overtake their peers in physical tests and technical skills.
The physical challenges they face early on can make them stronger technically and psychologically.
Early maturers who focused on strength over technique find they can't compete with more balanced players.
But by this point, many talented players have already missed their shot at the stadium.
And England may have missed out on its own Messi.
For all players to have the best chance to reach their potential, understanding growth is key.
Clubs must consider maturity when making decisions about training, competition and team selection.
Dr Sean Cumming is a senior lecturer in our Department for Health.
He researches growth and maturation in young athletes.
Sean works with the Premier League's James Bunce and Dan Hunt to support the Elite Player Performance Plan .
The Plan aims to improve the selection, training and development of academy players.
Clubs have to make decisions based on attributes which young footballers havenât yet developed.
Being able to predict each young player's true potential is essential.
Sean leads a scientific advisory group of leading researchers and practitioners in the field.
He has helped the Premier League establish guidelines and procedures for assessing and monitoring growth and maturation in youth footballers.
Sean has also helped enhance the leagueâs Player Management Administration (PMA) database.
Academies can use the PMA to track and account for differences in growth and maturation when evaluating players.
It monitors about 5,000 young footballers across the academy system.
The system assesses players aged nine to 17 on growth, fitness and performance throughout their early careers.
The PMA also allows academies to group players for training and competition by biological age, not chronological age.
This uses a process called bio-banding, which was first introduced in youth rugby.
By matching training and competition to the athleteâs level, practitioners can optimise development and reduce injuries.
Sean recently helped the Premier League organise the worldâs first bio-banded tournament.
Southampton, Stoke City, Norwich City and Reading football clubs all participated.
The players were between 11 and 14 years old, but competed against players of the same maturity level.
Initial feedback suggests it was successful for players and coaches, with further analysis underway.
Late-maturers had the chance to use their technical skills, play creatively and take on leadership roles.
Early-maturers found the competition more physically challenging, so they had to work harder and rely more on their technical abilities.
Once a club better understands a player's maturation, they can tailor their training.
One option is holding late developers back in a younger age group, so they can compete against players at the same maturity level.
Sean has acted as an independent judge in such cases, looking at a player's height, weight and other development indicators.
If he discovers the player is a late developer, he may recommend the Premier League holds them back.
Sean is also working with the Premier League to develop fitness standards based on age and maturation rate.
This will allow clubs to better evaluate player ability and potential.
The project aims to increase the number of home-grown players in the Premier League.
Clubs can use these standards when they make decisions about young footballers.
By assessing talent through the lens of maturity, clubs can understand a young player's true potential.
The project will show how growth and maturation contribute to footballers' development and the academy selection process.
It will determine how training and conditioning programmes impact player fitness beyond what can be expected from normal development.
The research has also contributed to educating staff working with young players.
Over 120 practitioners across 29 academies participated in workshops about understanding growth and maturation.
They can now give players the best training and conditioning for their rate of development.
Now today's small but gifted young players could develop into tomorrow's Premier League stars and World Cup winners.
Bio-banding could benefit players and clubs in other sports too.
Sean is now spending a day a week with Bath Rugby at their academy as part of a six-month project, working with Mark Atkinson and England rugby legend Danny Grewcock.
The project aims to bring the benefits of bio-banding to the development of young rugby players and contribute to the club's continuing success at nurturing new talent.
A Proximity to Discovery grant from the Medical Research Council makes this work with the club possible.
By understanding growth and maturity, we could see the potential of young athletes across all sports - and help them live up to it.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/legal-information/data-protection-act:
This page outlines the General Data Protection Regime that applies in the UK.
The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) has been tailored and incorporated into UK legislation by the Data Protection Act 2018.
The Data Protection Act 2018 ("the Act") applies to 'personal data', which is information which relates to individuals.
It gives individuals the right to access their own personal data through subject access requests and contains rules which must be followed when personal data is processed.
The Act works in two ways:
You should assume that any personal data relating to an identifiable living individual, held by the University, in any form, are covered by the Data Protection Act.
If you have access to personal data you must familiarise yourself with, and comply with, the following University resources:
If you are going to be working remotely or using a mobile device please also see data security off campus .
The Data Protection Act covers the processing of all 'Personal Data'.
This is data which constitutes information relating to a living individual, (a 'Data Subject') and from which (either on its own or together with other information held) the individual is identifiable, so data held purely in an anonymised form is not covered.
The Data Protection Act covers data held electronically and in hard copy, regardless of where data is held.
It covers data held on and off campus, and on employees' or students' mobile devices, so long as it is held for University purposes, regardless of the ownership of the device on which it is stored.
'Processing' is widely defined and includes every possible form of action that can be taken in relation to data including:
The University must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data and, in most cases, will also need to be satisfied that it is ânecessaryâ to process personal data to achieve the relevant purpose.
There are only six potential lawful bases for processing personal data:
Special Category Data (which used to be called 'Sensitive Personal Data') are personal data that is more sensitive and needs more protection.
In order to lawfully process any such special category data, in addition to having a lawful basis for its processing, the University will need an additional condition for processing.
There are ten such potential additional conditions which permit Special Category Data to be processed.
The most relevant in the context of the University are set out below:
Further information about the legal basis for processing personal data and the conditions for processing special categories of data can be found on the Information Commissionerâs Officeâs website .
The Data Protection Act sets out the six legal principles with which the University must comply whenever it processes personal data.
These stipulate that the data must:
1.
Be processed fairly, lawfully and transparently
In order for us to process data 'fairly', we should:
2.
Be processed only for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes
The main issues raised by the principle are:
3.
Be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are held
To ensure compliance:
4.
Be accurate and, where necessary, be kept up to date
Personal data must not be inaccurate or misleading to any matter of fact.
This applies to information from a third party.
The source of information should always be included on records.
5.
Be kept for no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose
As the University needs to hold and process personal data for a variety of different legitimate reasons, it is not always possible to stipulate how long particular data should be retained.
The university has a set of policies on the retention and disposal of different types of records .
For other types of data, it is often necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis when they should be destroyed.
6.
Be processed in a secure manner, taking appropriate security measures with regard to rights of accidental or unauthorised access to personal data, or accidental or unauthorised destruction, lose, use modification or disclosure of personal data
Access to personal data will only be granted to staff insofar as is necessary for legitimate operational purposes.
The personal or private use of personal data held by the university is strictly forbidden.
All staff with access to personal data must be mindful that they play a role in ensuring that it is always kept securely.
They must familiarise themselves with the University's Data Protection Policy and follow our guidance on data security .

Every spring, we host Founders Day, an event that celebrates our past, present and future.
The ceremony reminds us of the principles the University was founded on and continues to practise, like carrying out world-changing research and providing an excellent student experience.
Watch videos of recent Founders Day lectures and presentations .
On Founders Day, we remember the arrangement we made in the mid-1960s when the city of Bath provided some of its land for the University campus, but there were plans to build an institution here long before then.
In 1839, The Mirror of Literature, Amusement and Instruction published an account of the intended college on Claverton Down.
It described the plans for 'a lofty and commanding eminence', which were presented to Queen Victoria, who 'graciously approved of [them] and condescendingly accepted'.
The purpose of the institution was to 'afford a superior literary and scientific education...
auxiliary to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge'.
The Victorian plans for the college fell through due to lack of funding, but the area still needed an institution for teaching sciences and technology.
In 1851, the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace made people more aware of the quality of scientific and craft education in Europe.
In response, the Bristol Trade School, the first part of the institution that would become the University of Bath, was established in 1856.
Its aim was to provide industrial training in sciences and technology which, along with humanities and management, make up most of the subject areas we teach and research today.
Bristol Trade School became the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in 1885 under the patronage of the Society of Merchant Venturers.
The College grew through the years, joining with the Bath School of Pharmacy in 1929.
The School has since become our Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, but its original building is still standing in Bath on the corner of London Road and Cleveland Place.
The Merchant Venturers' Technical College also worked closely with the University of Bristol, providing its Faculty of Engineering until 1949, when the Society of Merchant Venturers dropped its support for technical education.
They passed control of the Faculty to the City of Bristol Education Authority, breaking the link between the College and the University of Bristol.
In 1963, the Committee on Higher Education published what was known as the Robbins Report.
It recommended that the College, now called the Bristol College of Science and Technology, should become a university and expand.
During the interval of a school play, the College's Principal, Mr George Moore, had a discussion with Mr H Brand, Director of Education for Bath.
It was that chance conversation that brought the idea of a university back to Claverton Down.
Within two years, Bristol College of Science and Technology had become the Bath University of Technology and Mr Moore, who had became Dr Moore, its first Vice-Chancellor.
From the beginning, the University was designed to be different, innovative and inclusive, and the campus was built to support this.
The Parade was imagined in architects' drawings like a central spine, allowing the University to expand at a natural rate while keeping the character and community of a town centre.
The proposed layout of the campus would encourage 'academic and social life closely linked in a concentrated 'urban' setting...
the University conceived as a single varied community' (from The Proposed University of Bath, A Technological University: Development Plan Report Number 1 , published 1965 by Bath University Press).
The first building, known as the âPreliminary Buildingâ, was finished in 1965.
Most of the rest of the buildings were constructed during the following 10 years, and the Preliminary Building became '4 South'.
Our Royal Charter was granted in 1966, officially establishing the Bath University of Technology, and our first students and staff began using the campus.
Many of them had transferred from Bristol College of Science and Technology.
In our first year, there were 1,145 undergraduates, 115 postgraduates and 470 members of staff.
The Charter sets out the principles which have now guided our teaching and research for 50 years.
It describes how 'The objects of the University shall be to advance learning and knowledge by teaching and research, particularly in science and technology, and in close association with industry and commerce'.
This 'close association with industry and commerce' has been a constant feature of our teaching and research.
Long before most universities were looking for funding from business, we worked closely with companies on joint projects, leading to new technologies and new approaches in research.
Our students have felt the direct benefit of these relationships, and the majority of our courses since 1966 have offered a placement year in industry.
Today, our students take placements in over 2,500 public, private and voluntary sector organisations, both in the UK and abroad.
Few other universities can match the quality or quantity of our placement opportunities.
In 1971, Bath University of Technology became the University of Bath.
Earlier that year, the University and the city of Bath had exchanged a 999-year lease contract for the use of Claverton Down.
At a ceremony in the Guildhall in Bath, the University Treasurer, Dr Ernest Le Quesne Herbert, presented the Mayor, Mrs Mollie Grosvenor, with an inscribed silver box.
The box would contain each yearâs rent of one peppercorn.
That year, the box held six additional peppercorns as back payment for the six years' rent since 1964, when the City of Bath first granted Claverton Down to the University.
Our coat of arms was designed for the installation ceremonies of our first Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor in November 1966.
It shows a dragon and a unicorn standing either side of a river holding, between them, a blue shield.
The dragon refers to the arms of the Society of Merchant Venturers, the unicorn to the arms of the city of Bristol.
On the shield are images of the Gorgon's head (now used as our logo and sometimes called the 'Sulis head'), a sword from the city's arms, and a Watt governor, a common component in engines, representing technology and governance.
Below the coat of arms, you can see on our motto, generatim discite cultus .
This has been translated as 'Learn the culture proper to each after its kind' (H.R.
Fairclough, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, 1916) and 'Learn husbandry specific to each species' (Kimberly Johnson, Penguin Classics, Penguin, 2009).
The motto was taken from Virgil's The Georgics , Book II, line 35, in a section about understanding the nature of an organism to make sure it thrives.
In her speech marking our 50th Anniversary, our former President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell commented that the motto instructs us to 'achieve an understanding of our world and strive to use our knowledge to ensure a sustainable future'.
Since 1966, we have continued to develop our campus and intellectual impact.
We are now ranked as one of the top universities in the country and have become a major contributor to the local and national economies .
In 2004, we launched the SETsquared Partnership with the universities of Bristol, Southampton and Surrey.
The partnership helps build new businesses and encourages more effective work with industry.
It is the largest collaboration of this kind in the UK, with a combined staff of 6,400 researchers and a research budget of Â£266 million.
We have continuously invested in new buildings and facilities, like the Sports Training Village (STV) , opened by Princess Anne in 2004.
The STV has since become one of Europe's best training centres for top-level athletes, hosting a number of international sports teams and Olympic medal winners.
In 2013 we became a founder member of GW4 .
The alliance of universities shares intellectual and physical resources, taking on national and global challenges and developing graduate opportunities.
In the same year, we were honoured to install our Chancellor, His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex .
The Prince Edward is the ceremonial head of the University and one of our most prominent ambassadors.
He awards degrees at graduation ceremonies and plays a key role in the business of the institution, advising on major policies and strategic matters.
Over the last few years, we have continued to build to create a more enriching and fulfilling student experience.
In 2014, we opened The Quads , a block of 75 modern flats for students living on campus.
In 2015, The Edge opened as a dedicated space for arts, education and events.
10 West opened in 2016, providing space for the expansion of the Department of Psychology and a new home for the Institute for Policy Research.
In the same year, we opened The Virgil Building , our student hub and professional services' building in the city centre.
We also celebrated our 50th Anniversary in 2016, giving us an opportunity to reflect on our past and look forward to our future.
In keeping with our founding principles and our current strategies , we will continue to deliver world-class research and teaching, extend our international influence, enrich our student experience and invest in new infrastructure.

The income we get from undergraduate students with Home fee status doesn't cover all the costs of running the University or carrying out the research that informs our teaching and helps build our reputation.
While tuition fees paid by Home students contribute to these running costs, universities like Bath also depend on funding from other sources.
This includes funding from the UK government using taxpayer money, for example, in the form of research grants and other types of investment.
This funding helps the UK higher education sector maintain its global reputation for research and teaching excellence.
The UK government also allows universities to earn income from other sources, including tuition fees paid by Overseas students.

As a result, your financial contribution to the UK in taxes will be less throughout your life.
For this reason, as a student with Overseas fee status, you're asked to pay more for the provision of your education through your tuition fees.

Individuals in this position often have no contact at all with their parents, or sporadic and conflictual contact.
Key causes of a breakdown of relationships could include (but are not limited to): emotional or physical abuse, mismatched expectations about family roles and relationships, or a clash of personality or values.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/guides/your-ucas-personal-statement:
Your personal statement is a vital part of your UCAS application.
Itâs your opportunity to explain why youâre passionate about your subject, how your experiences have prepared you, and why youâre a good fit for the course.
Admissions staff read personal statements carefully to understand your motivations and potential.
Youâll write one personal statement for all five of your UCAS choices.
We review personal statements as part of our holistic assessment of your application.
Weâre looking for evidence that you understand the subject and are ready to succeed on the course.
We are looking for your personal statement to show your enthusiasm, understanding and preparation for your chosen course.
You can demonstrate this in different ways drawing on your own experiences and activities, but these should be relevant to your subject.
While these experiences are important, we are primarily looking for you to show how you have engaged and reflected on those experiences.
Certain courses may also be looking for you to demonstrate how you have developed particular skills through your learning and reflections.
Your personal statement should focus as much as possible on your chosen subject.
If you want to include extra-curricular activities, we recommend you try to show the transferable skills that you have gained from them.
You can also mention activities that involve a very high commitment, such as elite sport, but do not dwell on them.
There are lots of different examples of relevant activities and experiences and no particular example is necessarily better than any other.
We are particularly conscious that relevant work experience is difficult to find for many subjects â most successful applicants have no relevant work experience.
From September 2026 entry, UCAS personal statements will be split into three sections, each with a specific focus.
The three questions are:
At Bath, we will continue to assess the statement as a whole.
It doesnât matter which section you place your content in â what matters is that your full statement covers the key areas we're looking for.
Each section must be at least 350 characters.
The overall limit remains 4,000 characters, and a counter will help you stay within it.
Find our guidance on how to approach drafting your personal statement
While each section has a different focus, don't worry too much about where you put things.
We'll read the full statement as one narrative.
What matters most is that it shows why you've chosen your subject and that you understand what studying it involves.
Here are some ideas about what you could cover in each section, to ensure your personal statement as a whole shows you are prepared and motivated to study your course:
Explain what sparked your interest.
Was it a particular topic, project or book?
Maybe a challenge or personal experience?
Help us understand what draws you to the subject.
If relevant, show how the course aligns with your future goals.
Avoid vague or generic comments â share personal insights and real enthusiasm.
Think about the subjects youâve studied and how they relate to your chosen course.
Focus on relevant topics, projects, or skills youâve developed rather than describing less relevant subjects you've studied.
You could mention:
Use our course pages to explore the knowledge and skills expected, and reflect those in your statement.
Activities beyond the classroom can show your commitment, curiosity, and growth.
You might include:
Explain what you learned, not just what you did.
Did you build new skills?
Shift your thinking?
Discover something unexpected?
For these courses, your personal statement must show you have the right attitude and experience to practise professionally.
Be sure to reflect on relevant placements or experiences, and explain what youâve learned from them.
If you have relevant mitigating circumstances that may have impacted your application, we encourage you to let us know about relevant mitigating circumstances through our confidential mitigating circumstances form.
This can also be included in your academic reference from your school or college.
Youâll submit the same statement for all five UCAS choices, even if theyâre at different universities or cover slightly different courses.
Try to keep your statement broad enough to apply to all your choices.
Focus on your subject area, rather than one specific course or institution.
Occasionally, we may ask you to submit a second statement.
However, for our most competitive courses, we wonât normally do this.
A statement that isnât clearly relevant may make your application less competitive.
It is important that your personal statement is individual to you and shows your character and your personal motivation for studying your subject area.
Your personal statement is supposed to be about you as an individual student, so try to avoid using common clichÃ©s or generic quotes, and do not include content from someone else's personal statement.
You can find tools to support you writing your personal statement online , such as sample statements and AI tools.
These may be particularly helpful if you are starting with a blank document.
AI may produce more generic content, so while it is acceptable to use it to structure your statement and compose your thoughts, you need to invest the time to make your individual personal statement as strong and tailored as possible.
You may be asked about your personal statement in any interview, so make sure everything you include is true.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/guides/visa-reimbursement-scheme:
We offer visa reimbursement to new and existing employees who need a visa to live and work in the UK while working for the University of Bath.
Eligible employees can also claim reimbursement of their Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) application fee and the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) fee.
This scheme applies to Home Office applications submitted on or after 1 August 2022.
In particular:
new employees who joined the University after 1 August 2022 on a Skilled Worker or Global Talent Visa and who are appointed on an open-ended or fixed-term contract of employment
existing employees on an open-ended or fixed-term contract of employment who are renewing their Skilled Worker or Global Talent Visa or applying for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) on or after 1 August 2022
employees who are switching from another visa category into the Skilled Worker or Global Talent visa routes on or after 1 August 2022 and who are appointed on an open-ended or fixed-term contract of employment (such as Student Visa switching into Global Talent Visa)
You will be able to claim for the cost of your visa or ILR application fee (plus endorsement fee for Global Talent visas) and Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) fee, where applicable.
How much you pay will depend on the length of your visa and whether you are applying from inside the UK or outside the UK.
For a list of current fees, please visit the Home Office Immigration & Nationality Fees webpage.
An employee is currently employed on a Skilled Worker visa which is due to expire on 1 November 2022.
They have accepted a fixed-term contract extension for another two years.
As they cannot apply for this visa more than three months in advance of its expiry, they submit a visa extension application on 1 August 2022.
They submit a claim for reimbursement of their visa and IHS fees once they have received confirmation that their visa application has been successful.
Their claim is approved and payment reimbursed.
Please note: where possible, visa application fees and related costs should be paid for out of grant funding.
The Visa Reimbursement Scheme is only open to eligible University of Bath employees.
The University offers a separate Interest-Free Loan Scheme for the dependants of new or existing employees and for employees who would like to claim for other visa related costs.
Departments are advised to plan ahead where possible to avoid short-term contracts arising giving claim to successive visa reimbursement requests.
The following guidelines should be followed when making an application for visa reimbursement:
As the reimbursement of visa, ILR or IHS fees is classed as earnings by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the University must deduct tax and National Insurance contributions.
You therefore need to be on the Universityâs payroll in order for a reimbursement to be made.
On the Visa Reimbursement Scheme application form, you will be asked to self-declare whether you are or have been a resident in the UK.
The Payroll Team will use this self-declaration to determine whether a tax exemption is applicable.
If you are unsure of your tax status or have any queries in relation to this, you are advised to check directly with HMRC , as the University will not be responsible for any tax liabilities which may be incurred.
If you resign or are dismissed from your employment contract, you will be required to repay on a pro-rata basis any visa reimbursement assistance received from the University as follows:
Please note, this scheme is non-contractual and the University reserves the right to amend or withdraw it at any point.
The University reserves the right whether or not to grant a reimbursement to an individual at its discretion.

New sentences found on https://bath.ac.uk/case-studies/making-amputees-feel-again:
Originally from Abu Dhabi, Leen came to Bath to study her undergraduate degree in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and is now pursuing a PhD.
She's researching how to create a greater sense of embodiment in prosthetic arms and hands for better control.
Leen hopes her work with sensory feedback systems will help reduce the high abandonment rate of upper-limb prosthesis and make life easier for the millions of people worldwide living with upper limb difference.
From additively manufactured carbon fibre to artificial intelligence, the last 50 years have seen huge advancements in the prosthetics industry.
Even with this fast evolving technology, there is still an incredibly high rate of people not using their prostheses.
This can lead to what is known as 'overuse syndrome', when someone relies too much on their intact limb, causing wear and tear on that side of their body.
Through her user research, Leen believes there is often a disconnect between expectation and the reality of being fitted with a prosthetic arm.
Prosthetic limbs can still be heavy, uncomfortable and difficult to control for their users.
They can also come with a hefty price tag.
'User research and identifying user needs has been central to my PhD.
A major issue with those wearing prostheses is that they receive no sensory feedback.
For example, how can you pick up a coffee cup if you can't feel how tightly to grip it?
I'm hoping to develop a non-invasive sensory feedback system that will enable amputees to literally "feel again".
This should help to reduce prosthetic limb abandonment.'
Much previous research has focused on creating a sensation by stimulating nerves using invasive methods such as implanting electrodes in the arm to send signals.
This requires surgery, which carries with it a risk of infection.
For those too far away or unable to afford healthcare, this simply isn't an option.
Instead, Leen is examining placing electrodes around the arm and using signals to target specific nerves.
'I aim to create a simple, cheap and non-invasive system that a user could fit themselves.
I'd like my research to be available to as many people as possible, so even those in the remotest parts of the world can access technology to help them live easier and healthier lives.'
For her research, Leen is using electrodes, an Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator, and a prosthetic hand from Open Bionics.
Leen originally wanted to be a maths teacher until the age of 13 when she saw a video of an amputee trying on a prosthetic lower limb.
Seeing the joy the new limb brought to its owner inspired her to become an engineer.
As an undergraduate, Leen worked on projects with sensors and spent time shadowing at a rehabilitation clinic in Abu Dhabi, as well as completing an internship at lower limb prosthesis maker Blatchford.
She took a placement year at Rolls Royce during her undergraduate degree and was offered a graduate role by the company.
Thanks to the support of her PhD supervisor, Dr Ben Metcalfe, and with funding from Dr Brian Nicholson, Tony Best and the Esther Parkin Trust, Leen chose to stay at Bath to study a PhD and pursue her dream to develop prosthetics.
'When I heard about the funding I thought: "that's amazing, I can do what I've always wanted to!" I also stayed at Bath because of the community feel.
Itâs just comfortable and it feels like home.'
A PhD involves plenty of paper writing, attending conferences, collaborating with other researchers and companies.
Leen spends her days coding and computational modelling, interviewing prosthetics users and performing literature reviews.
She does this alongside her volunteering activities, many of which she started as an undergraduate, including the University's Student Women's Engineering Society (WESBath).
Leen joined WESBath in her first year at University, she's held a number of committee positions including as Chair and still regularly takes part in their events, often as a speaker now.

If you are an EEA or Swiss citizen and were living in the UK by the end of 31 December 2020, you and your family can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), to continue living in the UK after this date.
If your application is successful, youâll get either settled or pre-settled status .
You must have arrived in the UK by 31 December 2020 to be eligible - if you arrived after this date, you will not be eligible and will need to apply for immigration permission under the relevant category at that time, such as a Student visa .
Your eligibility for the EU Settlement Scheme is based on the length of time you have been living in the UK.
To obtain settled status you will need to have lived continuously in the UK for five years.
If you have less than five yearsâ continuous residence at the point you apply, you will be eligible for pre-settled status.
You can then apply for settled status after you have lived in the UK continuously for five years.
with settled status you can spend up to five years of continuous time out of the UK without losing your settled status
with pre-settled status can spend up to two years in a row (before 21 May 2024) or five years in a row (after 21 May 2024) outside the UK without losing your pre-settled status, but this time will not count towards the five years continuous residence if you later want to apply for settled status
with settled or pre-settled status you will have access to healthcare, pensions and other benefits in the UK
with settled or pre-settled status you will be able to travel to and from the UK using a valid passport or (at least until 31 December 2025) a valid national identity card

If your status has been automatically extended, you should receive an email that states the new expiry date of your pre-settled status.
You should still apply for settled status as soon as you are eligible.
If you do not have settled or pre-settled status, the deadline to apply was 30 June 2021 (as long as you were residing in the UK by 31 December 2020).
You may be able to apply late in some circumstances.
If you have been granted pre-settled status, you can apply for settled status even if your application is after 30 June 2021 once you have built up your five years' continuous residence in the UK.
If you want to apply for settled status, you will need to submit an application before your pre-settled status expires.
The Settlement Scheme is delivered through a digital application process.
Applications are made online, with documents (where required) and proof of ID provided by post, in person, or via an online app (please note the app only works with Android devices or the iPhone 8 and newer Apple models ).
The Government has released full guidance and comprehensive step-by-step information on how to apply, including where to source your nearest location offering ID document scanning and how to get Assisted Digital support if required.
Applications are free of charge and you are not required to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge.
You can apply for the EU Settlement Scheme from inside the UK.
Most applicants can also apply outside the UK.
Applications outside the UK must be submitted through the online app as you cannot post your identity document to the UK to be verified.
You will need to have the following documents:
You are not required to show that you meet all the requirements of current free movement rules, such as any requirement to have held comprehensive sickness insurance or generally to detail the exercise of specific rights (e.g.
the right to work) under EU law.
The main requirement for eligibility under the settlement scheme is continuous residence in the UK.
The application form will ask for a National Insurance Number and complete an automated check to determine whether you are eligible for settled or pre-settled status.
If you do not have a National Insurance Number, or the automated check does not determine that you are eligible, there are other documents that you can use to demonstrate your continuous residency in the UK.
Documents can be photocopies or scans and don't need to be originals.
The evidence does not need to cover your entire residence in the UK - just enough to show whether you qualify for settled or pre-settled status.
Documents that only contain a single date will count as evidence for one month.
Documents can be used to cover a longer period if they have a start and end date covering a period longer than a month.
Evidence that covers a longer period of time:
Important: please do not use a student status letter as sole proof of residence if you were not residing in the UK before 1 January 2021.
If you do, it is likely that you will be asked to provide further evidence of your arrival date in the UK.
Evidence that covers a shorter period of time:
If you broke your continuous residence but resumed living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you will be able to apply for settled status after 5 years of continuous residence.
Your 5 years will start from when you re-entered the UK.
If you broke your continuous residence but did not resume your residency by 31 December 2020, you will likely not be eligible for settled status.
In this case
The Home Office have provided clarification on their definition of absences from the UK in relation to Covid-19.
This will affect you if you are an EEA / Swiss student intending to apply for settled status and have been outside of the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic.
If you have been absent from the UK due to Covid-19, we would advise you to keep a copy of any evidence relating to this absence (e.g.
doctorâs notes, emails of travel cancellations, screenshots from web pages showing confirmation of travel restrictions).
Please make sure you check your emails (including junk mail) and phone calls regularly in case you need to provide any further information.
If the Home Office have any questions about your application or require any further evidence from you, they will contact you directly.
If your application is successful, a letter will be emailed to you from the Home Office confirming your settled or pre-settled status.
You cannot use this letter to prove your status.
The letter will contain a link to an online service that you can use to view and prove your status.
If your application is refused or rejected, we would recommend that you contact the Student Immigration Service to ask for advice and support.
If some of the initial details provided at the time of your Settlement Scheme application have changed, you will need to update these so you can view and prove your rights to others, for example employers or landlords.
Use the Government online service if you have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme and you have changed your:
You must also use this service if you are waiting for a decision and you have changed your email address or phone number.
If you do not provide the correct contact details you may not get your decision.
Important: you cannot update your identity document or name if you are still waiting for your decision.
If you have got a new identity document you will need to send this in the post - you will be told where to send it after you have completed the online form.
The Student Immigration Service is available to support you to submit your application under the EU Settlement Scheme.
If you need support with your EU Settlement Scheme application, please book an Advice appointment (either virtual or in person).

As a non-traditional student without an Architecture or Engineering related degree, I was worried my experience would not be enough for such a technical degree.

In 2010, the Equality Act came into effect replacing and consolidating all existing legislation relating to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation and religion and belief, with one all-encompassing act.
View the full text of the Equality Act 2010 .
Discrimination occurs when someone is treated less favourably because of their race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin.
The Act makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate because of these characteristics.
If you have suffered discrimination at university, on your placement, or on an internship, report the incident online , or talk to a Careers Consultant or Placement Officer.
When applying for jobs, you may occasionally be asked to complete an 'equal opportunities monitoring form'.
The form may ask you to tick information relating to your ethnicity, gender, sexuality and age.
The form is voluntary and you do not have to complete it.
The reason why employers ask for this information is to monitor diversity within their business.
In most cases the equal opportunities form is detached from your application and the shortlisting panel don't see it.

Research shows that employees perform best when they can be themselves in a supportive workplace that respects privacy.
The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to treat LGBT+ staff any less favourably than other staff.
Many organisations today actively seek to diversify their workforce.
They also have policies to create a level playing field and guarantee equal opportunities in recruitment and progression.
Many also have active LGBT+ staff networks.
However, discrimination and harassment still exist.
Most LGBT+ people will sometimes think twice about how open they want to be, especially when an opportunity they want might be at stake.
For this reason, it's useful to know how LGBT+-friendly a potential employer might be.
What policies and support do they have?
What's it really like to work there?
The following information provides advice and tips to help with your concerns about disclosure and choosing the right employer.
Remember that you can discuss any aspect of your career, including LGBT+ matters, confidentially with a Careers Consultant.
A gay man, a lesbian, a bisexual person, and a trans person may have very different experiences of the same organisation.
Keep this in mind when searching for Diversity-Friendly Employers.
Try to find evidence relevant to your specific interests or concerns when researching an employer.
Look for signs that the employer has good policies and clear equality statements.
Research what they say on their website and in recruitment materials.
If in doubt, contact the HR department to ask.
Organisations like the charity Stonewall and the Employers Network for Equality & Inclusion (ENEI) have awards schemes that recognise LGBT+-friendly workplaces.
Stonewall's Proud Employers website showcases LGBT+-inclusive employers.
Their founding partner organisations are members of Stonewall's Diversity Champions programme.
This means they work with Stonewall to make sure their LGBT+ employees are treated equally.
Proud Employers includes a comprehensive jobs board, plus information and advice for both job seekers and employers on LGBT+ workers' rights.
Many organisations have LGBT+ staff networks or groups.
These may organise social events or be involved in institutional policymaking.
A group's existence can indicate how open and inclusive a workplace is.
But it's still worth checking whether the group is officially recognised and supported by the employer.
The best way to find out what life is like in a particular organisation is to speak to someone who works there.
Use your own contacts and networking resources like Bath Connection and LinkedIn.
See if there are any named contacts, such as staff network organisers, whom you might be able to approach confidentially.
This is a matter of personal choice.
Your sexuality has no bearing on your ability to do a particular job.
There is no legal obligation to disclose this, either during the recruitment and selection process or when you are in the post.
You may be asked to complete an equal opportunity monitoring form, but this is confidential and is not given to the recruiters.
Having said this, it's important to be true to yourself, but this doesn't necessarily mean coming out is the right thing to do.
It's possible to be 'authentically' not out in certain situations, and it's always up to you how much of yourself you're comfortable sharing.
However, it's important to consider that not disclosing your sexuality may carry certain risks.
Some research has shown that trying to keep your work and private life completely separate can take a physical and emotional toll, because eventually it gets exhausting pretending to be what you're not.
For a personal view on workplace coming out issues, it might be worth researching how others in your career sector have approached this and what their experiences have been.
When considering disclosure at the application stage, reflect on whether your sexuality could help pitch yourself to a potential employer.
For example, being an LGBT Officer at your college likely involved organisational skills, teamwork, leadership, responsibility, and sensitivity â all qualities employers look for.
Coming out to family and friends will have needed empathy and a willingness to take risks.
The employer will only know what you include in your CV or application.
However, your sexuality may be implied, for example, if you've held a position of responsibility within an LGBT+ society.
The inference may be that if you belonged to such a group, then you may be gay, lesbian or bisexual.
If you're unsure about disclosing your sexuality, you may wish to only state 'involved in various organisations at university' and focus on the skills you developed instead.
When it comes to interviews or assessment centres, it's important to decide what you're comfortable with.
This isn't simply about whether to discuss your sexual orientation.
It can also be about how you behave and what image of yourself you want to project.
If you decide not to disclose, you may need to think about language, dress code, and behaviour during an interview.
This may increase stress in an already stressful situation if you're distracted by second-guessing what an interviewer might assume about your sexual orientation.
Once you're in work, the question of how or whether you disclose may arise.
You may be the sort of person who always puts their sexuality out in the open from the start.
Or you may prefer to get to know your colleagues and the organisation first before disclosing.
Read our blog posts on being LGBT+ at work
Recent Supreme Court rulings have clarified/changed aspects of legal protection for trans individuals.
We are reviewing this guidance to make sure it reflects the current legal context.
Transgender (or gender reassignment) is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.
This means that if you are transgender, an employer cannot treat your application differently from another person who is not trans.
If they did, it would be illegal.
If you have a Gender Recognition Certificate, then the Gender Recognition Act adds further protection.
This includes keeping information about your trans status confidential.
This is in addition to the Data Protection (GDPR) Acts about private information that applies to everyone.
You are under no legal obligation to disclose details around this unless there is a 'genuine occupational requirement' related to the job.
If this is the case, an employer must show that the requirement to discriminate is a 'proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'.
You will also need to disclose if the job requires a DBS check.
In this case, you would contact the DBS Sensitivity Team and disclose your previous name and gender.
This will be kept confidential and not passed on to a potential employer.
Application forms sometimes ask about particular characteristics as part of equality and diversity monitoring.
But this information should be separate from the job application, anonymous and optional.
However, putting aside any legal requirements for disclosure, you may wish to consider reasons for and against disclosure to your potential employer.
Sadly, while the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Certificates are supposed to prevent discrimination, there is still significant discrimination against trans people.
The resources below can help you find employers who are more likely to see the positives that a person with a different perspective and life experience can bring to their company.
It could be helpful to disclose your trans status to some people at work, such as HR or a line manager, particularly if you want to discuss time off to progress your transition.
Employers must treat this like any medical appointment and treatment for anything else regarding time off.
It can often be stressful if you feel you need to be different and not your whole self during a job application process or at work.
Being open about being trans can remove this extra stress, but it depends very much on your personal circumstances.
Once a Gender Recognition Certificate is granted, a new birth certificate is issued, and a person's sex and gender then align for all legal purposes.
There's no need to declare you have a GRC unless you wish to.
Aside from DBS and security vetting for some jobs, the GRC is irrelevant for everything else relating to employment.
It is illegal (a criminal offence under the GRA 2004) for an employer to ask someone if they have a GRC, or to ask to see it.
In the UK, employers have to carry out 'right to work' checks where they confirm that a worker is legally able to work in the UK.
For these checks, you will have to provide ID.
If you're a British citizen, this will usually involve a check of your passport or birth certificate and national insurance number.
If you're not a British citizen, it will involve a check of your visa status.
You don't need a Gender Recognition Certificate to update your passport's gender or name.
You can do this with a letter from your doctor or medical consultant and evidence of your name change and usage.
So, if your passport shows your new name and gender, an employer wouldn't know you were transgender as part of these checks.
However, if you have not yet updated your passport or need to use your birth certificate for an ID check, then this would disclose your status to the employer.
You only need to provide these details when the employer needs them.
Usually, this is at the point where you have been offered a job.
At this point, if you have concerns, it is good to talk directly to HR or the recruiter about the checks.
Generally, it will be HR dealing with these checks rather than your line manager.
You can be explicit about who HR can tell about your trans status.
Revealing this will depend a great deal on the type of job you are applying for, how out you are out, and whether your previous name is requested in an employment application.
If a job application requests your previous name, it is usually for a background check.
Failure to reveal the information could be seen as a misrepresentation or, to be more exact, a material omission.
If the background check is in the form of a DBS, you can contact the DBS Sensitivity Team as mentioned above.
Another solution is to submit your application with your new name and then contact the HR department separately to explain the fact of transition.
You can request that this information remain confidential with the HR department as a matter of medical privacy.
A potential employer is likely to ask for references.
In this situation, contact your referee and explain that the employer will use your new name.

It is also used by league table compilers who calculate their own bespoke metrics using the data.
Our most recent Graduate Outcomes Survey results for 2021/22 leavers show that for first degree full-time UK domiciled graduates:

Our primary role is to help students plan their careers, develop their employability, make informed career choices and reach their goals.
This supports the Universityâs Strategy.
To achieve this, we collaborate with academic departments and employers to help students maximise their time here and enhance their opportunities.
If you have a specific request or canât find what you need, please contact the Careers Consultant working with your department and weâll do our best to help.
Our qualified careers professionals work with students at all stages of their degree programme.
We'd like your help to encourage students to use our services early in their studies.
We know you're often the first person students ask about placements, references, post-degree employment and study options.
This section explains how we support your students and how we can work with you.
Your department has a named Careers Consultant contact who'll be happy to work with you.
We can provide tailored careers sessions focusing on what your students need.
Popular topics include preparing for placements and post-graduation employment - covering CVs, applications, interviews, and psychometric testing.
We can also run events on career options or finding work experience for students not doing placements.
Sessions are designed around your students' needs and scheduled at the most appropriate times for each year group.
We have excellent relationships with employers and can arrange tailored employer-led events on career options, recruitment methods or specific employability skills like teamwork.
Our strong connections with local and national employers mean we can bring in the employers your students want to work for.
We offer confidential and impartial advice for students who are facing challenges such as changing their course or dealing with disappointing results.
Our one-to-one support can help students decide their best course of action.
There's a network of Bath graduates who are willing to speak to your students about many different careers.
To help you market your courses and help students make career choices, we manage information on graduate outcomes for all courses.
You can read more about this further down this page.
This is separate from the public information on what do first degree Bath graduates do?
We encourage you to link to our information pages, guides and web pages from your website and Moodle pages rather than download them.
We regularly update these resources, so linking to them makes sure your students have the latest version.
You can access our guides and information from the Resources tab in our student site, MyFuture.
If there's information you need or something you'd like us to do for your students, we're always happy to help.
Some students may need to make applications early in their final year for certain graduate roles, so preparation before this point will be very helpful.
Encourage your students to think about how they can develop their employability during university so they have the best chance of success in their graduate job applications.
Most students come to the University of Bath as a step towards their future career.
Academic departments and Careers must work together to help students make the most of their time here.
When students opt for placements, they gain several advantages.
Our Careers Consultants already work closely with many placement staff, using their expertise to support students throughout the application process.
However, we also think it's important that first- and second-year students not taking placements are encouraged to use us.
Most students know we exist, but only around half make use of us while they're here.
Experience has taught us that good exposure to students through their academic programme and departmental staff is the best way to get them to use us early enough to make a real difference.
It often simply gets them thinking about their prospects and what they need to do before they graduate.
At the very least, we'd like to talk to all undergraduate students near the start of their final year and Master's students early in their courses.
A half-hour dedicated careers talk within the department is enough for us to raise awareness of the job market, the application processes they'll face and the support we provide.
We also welcome referrals from your staff when they encounter students with employment concerns.
The problem is that for many students, this could be too late, especially if gaining relevant work experience or making early autumn applications is essential for success.
The careers message works best with regular, dedicated careers lectures at the start of each year.
These should be tailored to particular groups of students and supported by further events throughout the year, such as:
All these events are available by talking to your departmental Careers Consultant .
See 'Bespoke activities' below for more information about what we can offer your department.
To make sure we have successful, well-attended events that benefit your department, your students, and our staff, we'd ask you to do the following:
Allocate a member of staff to be in regular contact with Careers to plan events and talks.
This works best when it's a member of academic staff, as this makes sure all students â not just those going on placement â are involved in careers-related activities.
Publicise events well in advance to students and avoid clashes with deadlines, other events and reading weeks.
Where possible, build us into a programme of talks or events that students are obliged or required to attend.
Use departmental-related student societies to arrange or promote events and encourage their peers to attend.
Try to make the event a specific careers event rather than part of a longer 'general' lecture where our message is lost.
Short, well-scheduled, tailored events for particular groups work best as the message can be made more relevant to them.
One of our aims is to help students develop their employability skills and gain appropriate work experience.
Our regular contact with employers means we know what kind of skills and personal qualities graduate recruiters are looking for.
Our position within the University makes us aware of the range of opportunities available to students, which can help them develop these skills and qualities.
Also, our understanding of the graduate job market and current recruitment methods and career paths is invaluable to our students.
We're happy to use these skills and knowledge to help you develop your programmes to address the issue of employability.
Contact the Careers Consultant for your department to discuss improving your studentsâ employability.
We're always happy to work with you to develop resources or activities that would most benefit your students.
Here are some examples of events we've developed with and for individual Departments in the past.
Please contact your departmentâs named Careers Consultant to discuss how we can best help your students.
We regularly offer talks within Departments.
These can be anything from a ten-minute introductory session in Induction Week to lunchtime talks giving more detailed information.
Sessions can be tailored to suit each year group - for example, career planning for first years, placement preparation for second years and job-seeking strategies for work experience or graduate jobs.
We can also tailor sessions for international and Master's students.
The Careers Consultant for your department will offer weekly, in-faculty drop-in sessions to your students.
Please contact them to find out when and where these are held.
We produce resources that are tailored to Bath students and the courses they study.
For example, the âCareers inâ¦â series includes 'careers in sport', 'careers in science', âCareers in psychology and mental healthâ and many others.
These guides have information on the skills developed in specific courses, possible career options, places to look for jobs and suggestions on how to maximise employability.
We also have our Specialist Support guides aimed at particular student cohorts.
We regularly work with academics and placement teams to put on events where alumni can share their experiences and advice with current students.
Please contact your departmentâs Careers Consultant to find out about existing activity, or to suggest a potential contact â we would love to hear from them!
We can run bespoke sessions on, for example, CVs for placement students.
In the session, students learn how to tailor their CVs for particular roles, as well as take part in a job shortlisting exercise for a specific post.
This can significantly improve the quality of CVs and subsequent success rate in getting placements.
We can run similar sessions for interviews, where students can experience what it is like to be interviewed as well as being the interviewer.
Careers supports the collection and analysis of graduate outcomes data from all students at a specified time after graduation.
For further details see Graduate Outcomes information for staff .
Please contact Careers if you have any queries about graduate outcomes.
All students at the University of Bath are welcome to make full use of our services.
Those who are currently on placement can contact us via email.

We interact with employers regularly and have a comprehensive network of about 4,000 organisations of all sizes, all interested in Bath students.
This is part of what makes us so effective at working with students to improve their employability â we hear directly from employers about what they want and how the students can best demonstrate it.
In essence, we act as a very big âshop windowâ for the University â did you know that we:
However, we know that employers and alumni will often contact you with opportunities or offer to arrange sessions.
This section aims to help you by setting out what we already do and reassuring you that we can help you by making sure your students get all the opportunities without information overload or event clashes.
We run a comprehensive, free, online vacancy advertising service for employers.
Details of all sorts of opportunities are advertised on MyFuture , where all students can view them.
If you send details to us via careers@bath.ac.uk , we will upload them for you.
This means your students need only look in one place for great opportunities.
Alternatively, please refer employers to our vacancy advertising policy with details on how to submit opportunities.
Please feel free to send the request to our Employer Engagement Team .
We already offer a target email service to selected student groups on behalf of employers.
This operates as a chargeable service.
If you choose to offer this to some employers without charge, then you may be inundated!
To avoid information overload, we make sure that the emails are brief, small capacity, relevant and only sent to limited year/subject groups.
We also spread them out if there are several in any one week.
Hopefully, you already know about our centralised events, skills workshops and careers fairs .
If an employer asks you if they can come on campus, whether just to speak to your students or to all, please get in touch.
We can then do our best to make sure that no clashes of interest for the students arise from what we already have in place.
Our Employer Engagement Team will be happy to book in an employer presentation or advise on the current diary.

We advertise graduate positions, internships, vacation and other work experience, volunteering and funded postgraduate study.
There is no charge for a basic advert, and a link to your website is automatically included.
Please note all students are expected to search the portal themselves - submitting a vacancy does not automatically alert them to it.
Also, graduates are those no longer studying here and have completed their studies and left University.

We require all internship roles to comply with National Minimum Wage legislation and for the employer to specify the duration of the internship.
We recommend that advertisements for internship vacancies should follow the Common Best Practice Code for High-Quality Internships produced by the Gateways to the Professions Collaborative Forum.
A convention de stage is a type of contract between an employer, a student and a university.
They are required in France and common practice in some other European countries for many types of temporary vocational work experience.
These documents must be signed by all three parties and are a formal contractual agreement, stating the responsibilities of each party.
They are therefore more than just proof of student status.
If your vacancy is for a sandwich placement (a placement which is a formal part of the degree programme), this is straightforward and the required agreements are arranged through placements staff in the academic departments .
For other types of work, such as summer internships, agreements can be arranged providing that the applicant is registered as a student at the University for the duration of their placement.
The University cannot provide a convention de stage for graduates because British universities are not legally responsible for their students after they graduate.
In lieu of a convention de stage, we are aware that some employers (not in France) may accept proof of their student/graduate status providing that the student/graduate also takes out personal insurance cover.
So you may wish to consider this possibility.
When you submit your vacancy for advertising, please make it very clear in the text if you require a convention de stage (or any other similar arrangement).
This means we can ensure the vacancy is classified to appear in searches correctly and avoids disappointment for candidates and yourselves.
We always require clarity about your requirements in your vacancy text.
If we need clarification we will query this before publication.

Instead, upload one generic advert summarising the opportunities available and your services.
Adverts should include detailed information about eligibility requirements, benefits and what is not included.
The organisation must have a website that verifies details in English and includes information about the teaching positions.
We reserve the right to decline advertisements that we do not deem suitable or do not include enough information.
We will not enter into further correspondence if an advert is declined.
In order to justify our administration and to give students a reasonable time period to apply, we will not advertise unless your closing date is at least four weeks after the publishing date.
We do not promote opportunities (e.g.
insight days) which would require students to be away from the University for more than one day during term-time.
You can see academic year dates to help when planning your event.
For one-day opportunities which we advertise, we include a line of text which advises students that it is their responsibility to ensure that they are not missing teaching or other academic activities in order to participate.
For English language teaching positions, we require you to define the level of language skills required, and to separately identify any legitimate nationality requirements.
In particular, we do not publish vacancies described as requiring a "native English speaker".
We are happy to use phrasing such as "fluent English speaker" or "native-level English speaker" to define your requirements.
This is to ensure that there is no inappropriate exclusion of candidates who are not UK nationals but who speak English at the level you require.
We do not advertise commission-based jobs, franchise or self-employment positions, or opportunities for which the postholder/student is charged or required to invest (except in the case of postgraduate study where the student will incur some expense).

We just wanted to highlight the below guidance for job vacancies and international hires.
It is illegal for employers to discriminate against international students: whilst the law requires employers to only employ individuals with a right to work in the UK it is unlawful not to accept applications from or employ someone on the basis of their nationality.
Some exemptions apply (for example roles relating to national security), but in general employers that refuse to accept applications from people just because they may need a visa could be open to claims of discrimination (which is what happened in the case of Osborne Clarke Services v Purohit).
Avoid possible claims of indirect race discrimination by instead:
