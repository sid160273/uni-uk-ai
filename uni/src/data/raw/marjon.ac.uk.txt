New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/about-marjon/history:
In 1840 our first students took their seats in St Johnâs College, Battersea.
In 1841, the first students arrived at St Mark's College, Chelsea.
The two colleges amalgamated in 1923, after the War, becoming 'Marjon'.
Marjon exists because our founders saw a problem of poverty in Victorian London, and they acted.
They set up colleges specifically to educate young orphans from the workhouses, and bring them out of poverty.
They recognised that teaching was a profession, which needed rigour, technique and sophistication, and with their actions they committed to improving education for all.
For 180 years, Marjon staff and students have acted on the courage of their convictions, making a difference to lives across the world.
We look forward to a vibrant future of enhancing even more lives by thinking and acting differently.
Innovative plans for the first bespoke teacher training college, St John's in Battersea, were first set in motion in the 1830s.
Our first students â including orphans from a local workhouse â started their training in February 1840.
The founding principals of each college, James Kay-Shuttleworth of St Johnâs in Battersea and Rev.
Derwent Coleridge of St Markâs in Chelsea have been credited for developing the first national school system, and the colleges that were needed to train the teachers.
Both were driven by their strong principles of social justice and first-hand experiences of poverty and inequality, to establish a means for everyone to access high quality education regardless of background or means.
They saw education as key to providing a pathway out of poverty and towards opportunity and achievement for all.
Kay-Shuttleworth, as the first Secretary of the Committee of Council on Education established 'Her Majestyâs Inspectors of Schools'- an early form of OFSTED â a body designed to provide a support network for newly qualified teachers and to share practice.
Impatient with the delays in pushing the scheme of national education forward, he funded St Johnâs College himself for its first two years.
He travelled extensively in the UK and overseas, visiting existing educational establishments on fact-finding expeditions.
His pioneering scientific approach to research was pivotal to the foundation of the Statistical Society and his spearheading attitude to education was written about by Marx and Engels.
Coleridge also championed the role of the arts and culture in the creation of a balanced, spiritual and meaningful âeducation for lifeâ.
Between them they created the foundations of the universal free education system.
Marjon moved to Plymouth in 1973.
Affiliated to the University of Exeter in 1991, we were awarded university college status in 2007 and finally received legal confirmation of university title in 2013.
We are now known as Plymouth Marjon University, a trading name of The University of St Mark & St John.
The inspirational influence of our founders lives on today in the passion and commitment of our staff to help students succeed.
From day one, the attitude has been to constantly look for newer and better ways of doing things.
We are a values-led institution which always puts students first.
We are incredibly proud of our alumni who go on achieve and become fantastic role models for those who come after them.Every one of our students has their own success story.
Some have overcome incredible odds to get to University.
Many are first in the family to study at university.
Others come later in life and never thought they would have such an opportunity to prove what they are capable of.
For all our students, studying with Marjon is a life-changing experience.
Our proudest moments are in being there to share these intensely personal achievements with our students, who will always remain our greatest inspiration.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/courses/apprenticeships:
Apprenticeships are an exciting route into higher education because they allow you to earn while you learn through hands-on training from expert professionals as well as gaining valuable practical experience in the workplace.
Apprenticeships are available at different levels.
Here at Marjon, we offer Higher Level Apprenticeships and Degree Apprenticeships.
Higher Level Apprenticeships are Level 4 or 5 qualifications which are typically Foundation Degrees.
Degree Apprenticeships are those at Level 6 and 7 which are equivalent to a Bachelor’s, or Master’s degree.
On an apprenticeship you are an employee with a contract of employment of a minimum of 30 hours per week.
You will study for at least 20% of your working hours and by the end of an apprenticeship, you’ll have the right skills, knowledge and qualification needed for your chosen career.
You will be supported through the course by a mentor in your workplace and a dedicated course tutor, alongside the Marjon subject team.
Apprenticeships are funded from contributions made by the government and your employer.
This means you will not have any student loans or tuition fees, but you must fulfil the requirements of your employment contract as well as completing the work for the course.
You can learn more about how apprenticeships are funded on our dedicated page.
Apprenticeships offer you the opportunity to earn money while you qualify and are attractive because you don’t have to pay tuition fees.
Additional bursaries are also available to those with caring duties, or who are care leavers.
Apprenticeships can be an excellent choice if you are starting out on a career and if you want to enhance promotion opportunities in a workplace which you are already established in.
For people who are leaving school or college and know the area of work they would like to train in apprenticeships can be ideal as you can start work in that profession straight away.
They’re also a great choice for those who have been working for some years and have commitments which would make it difficult to stop earning to achieve a necessary qualification or gain a degree.

Here are some of the most common myths about when you can apply to university: Can you apply to university after the deadline?
Yes, you can still apply to university after the deadline, but there are two things to keep in mind.
Firstly, applications are considered on a first-come, first-served basis, so if you’re applying later than January, it’s best to do it as soon as you can.
Later in the year, you may have less chance of getting an offer.
Secondly, some courses may already be full by the time you apply.
If that does happen though, you can still try a different course, or a different uni.
Can making a late application affect your student funding?
You can still apply for student finance even if you're applying late for university.
You don't have to have finalised your university or your course to apply.
Just note that the deadline to apply for finance to be guaranteed payment before the course starts is usually about the end of May, so if you apply later, you may find your funding comes through a bit later.
Will you be able to get into a good university if you apply late?
No matter which university you want to apply to, there’s a chance that a place on your chosen course is still available.
The only way to guarantee you don’t get a place is if you never ask!
So, even if you've missed the deadline for applying to university, that doesn’t mean your uni dreams are over.
There are still plenty of options available to you, and your perfect course could be right around the corner.
Some tips to think about when making a late university application Contact the course lead – they will be able to tell you if the course is full and give you an idea of whether it’s the right course for you.
When you do apply they’ll often be part of the application review process, and if they already know you as a person, that will only help them make a decision.
Start your application as early as possible – courses that aren’t full after January will still be admitting new students (hopefully including you) so make sure you get the application in as soon as you can.
Highlight your strengths and achievements.
Make sure your application shows why you would be a good fit for the university and course you are applying for.
Be persistent.
Don't give up if you don't get an offer straight away.
Keep applying to universities and you’ll find the one that’s right for you.

Lauren: my first tip would be don't panic at all um because you just don't know where things could take you so for me i
was really set on one certain university and i thought that that was going to be like the be all and end all of my career
and if i didn't go there then like I wouldn't have a real degree and things
like that and taking the chance that i did and was definitely the best thing i could have done it saved me a year of being at
college and as the way the world works i've met people now that i know that if i'd have waited until next year i never would
have got to meet them and so that's quite a big thing for me also try and be prepared as you can on
the phone so write down things that you've done in your life that are good experience so i'm a qualified rainbow leader
and then i volunteered with children so i had things like that and key points of skills and things i developed while i
was doing that so that when i was asked on the phone okay tell me about a time where you've shown
say confidence or organization that was already in front of me and I didn't have to panic and worry i could
just like draw on it straight away um but mainly just be open-minded um
you're like best course you may never have heard of the university marlon's quite small and i think it's definitely
underrated people don't know we exist as much as we do and the main thing is it's your degree it's not your parents or
your like boyfriend girlfriend friends it's going to be the rest of your life that this is going to impact so make sure it's the decision that's right for you it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks
If you'd like to come and see our beautiful green campus before you make a decision, book a place on one of our Personalised Campus Tours.
Lauren: so we rand around a few you unis andthey just didn't want to know I didn't have the grades and that's what they were focused on and then I rang Marge on
and the first thing they said is okay well why why do you want to come and study this course and I could speak about speech and I'm so P for ages I was really excited and had all this experience and that's all they really cared about they wanted to know that I was passionate and mainly that I was going to be committed the first ad I spoke to you was just super friendly and she was really excited it felt like she was excited almost like she was matchmaking me of my course and and a
lot of the other unions I'd spoken to it was kind of more of a formality but she definitely put me at ease and just made
me even more excited to be speaking to Marjonand then I was connected through to the administration for my course and she was just so friendly and really welcoming and just seemed so interested in me and a lot of the other
places I've spoken to I just didn't get that at all but it kind of gave me the confidence to speak more about myself
and because that can be really awkward sometimes you kind of got to like big yourself up and mention all these things
that normally if you're quite like a modest person it's really difficult to do but she just made that so much easier
and I could tell that she really wanted me to do well and like she wanted to let me on the course arms I'm really happy
that I picked up the phone and I honestly can imagine now what would be like if I hadn't I've met so many
incredible people made so many friends and my lecturers are incredible and absolutely loved my degree so is
definitely one of the best decisions in my life.

Marjon Students' Union works towards a long term strategic plan which was developed in consultation with the students we represent.
To ensure transparency all of our policies are online.
We also work in compliance with 1994 Education Act and Charity Commissions regulations.
MSU Constitution, Minutes, By-Laws and Policies can all be found here and downloaded.
Click on the link below.
Our students said that they would like to see a strong, vigorous and well-resourced students' union that is transparent, accountable and effective.
We invest time and effort in seeking out well-qualified and competent trustees who understand how higher education works, and who are committed to student welfare.
We train, develop and actively engage with the trustee board and ensure that they are well informed and appropriately trained to fulfil their governance obligations to the MSU membership.
We ensure that the successive sabbatical teams, core staff and our governors have an understanding of the higher education landscape and the conditions that impact Marjon.
This encompasses the University strategic objectives, infrastructure, team, and how this continuously evolving landscape impacts our organisational welfare and delivery.
Our students said that long term sustainability of the Students' Union was important to them.
We respond by committing to ensure our governance, sabbatical, management and executive processes and personnel are informed, up-to-date and vigilant.
We commit to engaging in appropriate conferences, training events, meetings and other opportunities to hone our organisational competence and learning knowledge culture which will benefit our students and enhance our strategic delivery.
We will stay informed on the changing needs of our student body by embedding research into our culture and maintaining data on student demographics, student welfare needs and the finer nuances of student voice issues.
Student Reps are a critical part of how Marjon continuously improves the student experience.
They are elected at the start of the academic year to represent their course mates.
Reps are elected for each course, and for each year, and they gain support from other reps both within the same course and across other courses.
They represent students formally through Staff Student Liaison Committees (SSLCs) and the Student Experience Council (SEC).
They attend SSLCs for their programmes, as well as attending SEC as often as possible.
Within SSLCs an issue relating to the course can be raised.
If this is unable to be resolved at an SSLC or needs further action at a University-wide level, it is then taken by the Student Reps to be raised at SEC.
Student Reps gain skills in influencing and achieving goals, as well as listening to others and representing on behalf of them.
They are trained to be proactive in asking their course mates for anything they want raised at an SSLC or SEC, and all students are encouraged to approach their Student Rep with any issues.
In the Student Union we support, train and encourage good repping, and act as a sounding board when reps need us.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/results:
This page is to guide students, and sometimes their parents or external supporters, in understanding their results.
It may be particularly helpful for students who are in their first generation of their families to go to university, and their supporters, to help explain some of the complexities around results.
Note this page is written with our standard undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in mind, rather than short courses, or courses which don’t bear any credits, (ie just pass or fail) or Certificates.
Results come out in March, (for Semester A and Term 1 assessments) July, (for Semester B and Term 2 and 3 assessments) and October (for Semester C, which are normally postgraduate assessments) – and if you take a resit at undergraduate level, your results come out in mid-September.
If you take a resit at postgraduate level, your results come out in March the following year.
It’s critical that you spend some time looking at and understanding your results.
It may be tempting to avoid taking in the feedback – but you need to engage and understand them.
Go to the Results Portal: https://www.marjon.ac.uk/students/resultsonline/ Check your results.
To understand your results, read this page on our website which explains the information, and why it matters.
Ensure you are clear on which modules you have passed, which you have failed.
If you have failed a module, you will need to work out what to do.
The results will be available online for 3 weeks only and you can download your results.
On most programmes of study, when you finish your programme of study, you will get a degree classification – your overall results.
It’s important to understand for your degree which modules will and won’t contribute to your final results.
(See Section 1.4, para.
3 of the Student Regulations Framework for a brief explanation) For a standard Batchelor’s degree (usually a three year undergraduate degree) the top classification is a “first”.
Typically, if your average marks are over 70%, you would be awarded a first.
Other classifications are below: How do I write it?
Official title How will you hear people referring to it?
What are the standard marks?
Grade: 1 st “First class honours degree” “I got a first” 70+ Grade: 2:1 “Upper second class honours” “I got a two-one” 60 to 69 Grade: 2:2 “Lower second class” “I got a two-two” 50 to 59 Grade: 3 rd “Third class” “I got a third” 40 to 49 Below 40% is a fail, and you are not awarded a degree.
For Foundation level degrees (usually a two year programme of study) or a Master’s degree, the results will be phrased differently: Foundation degree with distinction Foundation degree with merit Foundation degree pass Master’s degree with distinction Master’s degree with merit Master’s degree pass
How do I write it?
Official title
How will you hear people referring to it?
Grade: 1 st
“First class honours degree”
“I got a first”
70+
Grade: 2:1
“Upper second class honours”
“I got a two-one”
60 to 69
Grade: 2:2
“Lower second class”
“I got a two-two”
50 to 59
Grade: 3 rd
“Third class”
“I got a third”
40 to 49
Below 40% is a fail, and you are not awarded a degree.
For Foundation level degrees (usually a two year programme of study) or a Master’s degree, the results will be phrased differently:
For a standard year on an undergraduate course, there are 120 credits across the year .
(If you are part-time it will be fewer credits, and fewer on some courses.
For the purposes of this explanation, we’ll use 120 credits as the standard.) You have to be awarded the 120 credits to pass the year.
Your credits are split across the modules for the year, for example most of our courses have 20 credits for a standard module, and 6 modules in the year, to total 120 credits.
You have to get the 20 credits for each module to reach 120 credits.
Think of each module as a gate you have to pass through.
By achieving a pass mark on each module, you will receive the full credits for the module.
You don’t get more credits for getting higher marks than the pass mark - but your final grade will be higher.
Each module might have several different elements you are assessed on, for example a presentation might be worth 20% of the credits, and a report might be worth 80% of the credits.
Be sure to know this in advance : there is no point putting all your effort into one element worth 20% of the credits and little effort into the other element worth 80% of the credits.
You can check this by looking at the documentation on the course page of the website or the marking rubric on Canvas.
You are awarded a mark out of 100 for each element, and as mentioned, these are weighted across the elements.
As noted, in a typical year at undergraduate level, you need to get 120 credits to pass and progress to the next stage (or be awarded your degree).
When you get your results it will tell you whether you have enough credits to progress, or if you need to do something else, such as resit a module.
If you fail a module, you might be able to resit it, and in some circumstances, and only on specific courses, you might be allowed to “trail it” into the next year, which means you re-take it at the same time as progressing with the next year of your course.
There is information about this below.
When you look at your results, you might see a module which says you have failed it, which may mean as things stand you are not allowed to progress to the next stage.
It’s essential that you are clear on your options here.
Carefully reading the results portal will help, but we strongly suggest you also have a discussion with a member of the Registry team during the Results Support Pop-up sessions in the Hub, which run in the few days around results releases, and with your Personal Development Tutor.
Some of the options are described below, but there are other situations too.
In short, it can be relatively complex and it is quite normal to ask for support and explanation.
You need to be proactive in this, although it’s likely your Personal Development Tutor will also raise this with you if they are concerned about your academic progress.
Resitting an assignment or module A relatively common situation is that you might be permitted to resit the module ; this means you will need to submit work by the resit deadline in order to be assessed again.
This does not require you to take the full module again or attend the module again.
In most circumstances, you would complete your resit before your next stage begins (in a typical case, you might submit a resit assessment in July and get results in mid-September, before you need to enrol on the next stage).
To find the deadline for resits, and the assessment information, look on your course page on Canvas.
You can double check with rpso@marjon.ac.uk or with your programme lead.
We strongly recommend not waiting until the deadline but submitting your resit work as soon as you can whilst the knowledge is fresh in your mind.
Retaking the year You might be permitted to retake the year in full, or occasionally retake just one module , which means you will need to re-enrol and re-register.
This usually involves full attendance and repeating all the work, and involves paying tuition fees so it’s important to understand what your standard student loan will cover.
Very occasionally students might be allowed to retake a module “without attendance” but this is rare as it involves very little support, no DSA support etc.
It is very dependent on the programme which options are available and so talking to your PDT is essential.
Trailing a module into the next year Sometimes, you will be allowed to progress into the next year even when you haven’t completed all the credits, but you will be “ trailing a module ”.
This means you progress to the next stage, but with an expectation you will also be retaking a module that you have failed.
It’s important to understand this can be a very high workload.
It will involve attendance at both the module you are trailing, and the next year of your degree, in which the complexity generally steps up anyway.
The option is not guaranteed, and is never allowed on some courses.
In any circumstances, this is never allowed unless you have attempted the module (rather than not submitted at all) and in addition, your average module marks in the previous stage must be at least 50%.
For clarity, individual modules might have scored less than 50, but your average must be above 50.
This is because trailing a module is academically rigorous and we need to be sure you can achieve success this way.
You can never trail modules beyond one year.
Having to leave You might not be permitted to continue on your course .
Sometimes you might request to continue but changing courses to something related – this is not guaranteed but can be worth an exploration.
You may sometimes be offered an exit award, for example a Certificate of Higher Education if you have successfully completed a prior year.
In this case you are very welcome to come and celebrate your achievement at graduation.
Whilst leaving may feel upsetting, it’s important to consider the skills and knowledge you have gained, and what your future options are.
Learning happens right from the first week of a degree: it doesn’t arrive neatly packaged at the end of three years.
So regardless of the timing, you will definitely leave with something.
There are many mature students at Marjon who tried a university course that just wasn’t for them when they were younger, and then found their perfect subject and career later in life, and thrived.
Try to remain positive and go forward confidently.
If you need some good guidance on this, talk to our Futures team .

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/report-hate-crime:
What is a hate crime?
A hate crime is defined as 'Any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person's race or perceived race; religion or perceived religion; sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; disability or perceived disability and any crime motivated by hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender.' A hate incident is any incident which the victim, or anyone else, thinks is based on someone’s prejudice towards them because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or because they are transgender.
Please report!
Hate crime of any type is unacceptable and must be challenged.
The University, as a third party hate crime reporting centre, is committed to understanding the impact and experience of hate crime and encouraging students and staff to report all incidents.
Individuals can report hate crime directly to Devon and Cornwall Police at:- Report hate crime | Devon & Cornwall Police (devon-cornwall.police.uk) If you are unsure about whether your experience is a hate crime, you can find out more about hate crimes here:- What is hate crime?
| Devon & Cornwall Police (devon-cornwall.police.uk) We would recommend you also let the University know what you have experienced so that we can support you.
You can find trained staff at Student Wellbeing & Support; Chaplaincy or the Student Union office.
If you would prefer to talk to us before reporting a hate crime yourself, you can complete this form as a first step to seeking help:

1) What if I want to remain anonymous to the university?
You can make an anonymous report through the Hate Crime Reporting form above.
On receipt of this form, Student Wellbeing and Support will report the incident as a third party reporter (unless you’ve reported it yourself).
You should note that reporting a crime anonymously does mean that the police will not be able to directly investigate that report with the perpetrator however it will be held as intelligence by them which may be useful if you or another person, experience a repeat of the hate crime at a later date and decide to waive anonymity at that point.
Please note that we will be unable to offer you support if you only contact us via the reporting form without leaving your name.
You can still seek support in the University through asking for a Wellbeing appointment, self-referring to the Counselling team or speaking to Chaplaincy or Student Union teams (email to sws@marjon.ac.uk and simply request support from the appropriate team or go to the Chaplaincy/SU teams as appropriate).
2) What if I want to remain anonymous to the police?
We can report an incident to the police on your behalf.
The police cannot investigate when a report is anonymous however information is held as intelligence by them which may be useful if you or another person, experience a repeat of the hate crime and waive your anonymity at that point.
Please ask a member of staff within the Student Wellbeing and Support, Chaplaincy or the Student Union teams for a trained hate crime reporter who will be able to provide you with support and report the hate crime on your behalf, complete our form above or email the Student Wellbeing and Support team at sws@marjon.ac.uk and ask for an appointment.
3) What if I don’t mind reporting but don’t want an investigation?
You can report the incident direct to the Police here:- Report hate crime | Devon & Cornwall Police (devon-cornwall.police.uk) stating on the report that you do not want an investigation but would like the incident logged.
This can be useful if there is a repeat offence at a later date and you do decide the Police should investigate at that point.
The Police may contact you but you will remain in control of whether the incident can be investigated by them.
Alternatively you can follow the advice above in FAQ 2.

Reflections on school leadership and the importance of narratives.
Stories are critical to making sense of the world.
We all need stories; stories we tell ourselves (private narrative) and stories we tell others (public narrative).
It's what makes us human.
The call to leadership is firstly a story of self then a story of the community which becomes a story of us.
Narrative theory as a research methodology deepens understanding, replicability, and relatability.

‘Top Tips for Early Career Researchers’ It’s not easy being an Early Career Researcher!
Establishing your professional identity, developing your independence as a researcher, teaching, competing for grants, coping with increasing levels of administration and – oh yes –developing your ‘output’ – that dreadful word so often used to describe the writing born of your research.
A word that denies the creative and emotional endeavour that writing entails.

1530 - 1630: Professor Stephen Gorard , Durham University.
' How can we judge the trustworthiness of research?' Whether you are a user of research or an early career researcher (or both), it is important to learn early on that not all research is as trustworthy as the rest.
Based on lessons learnt from conducting many structured reviews of bodies of evidence, this session invites a discussion of how all of us can judge the relative quality of evidence, how the context matters, and how research is best presented to make appropriate use as easy as possible.

The Ethical Review Process is a cornerstone of decision-making and praxis in research.
Research is a step into the unknown.
As a result, seeking unrevealed understanding often presents a range of risks.
Some are trivial.
Others profound.
The Ethical Review Process is designed to facilitate excellence in the pursuit of knowledge by helping researchers to identify such risks as well as ethical issues in the design, conduct and oversight of research.
This enables researchers to develop reasoned and ethically defensible responses to these issues so that they may conduct their research while protecting themselves, their participants, colleagues, environment, and the University.

Read our full press release
The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the current system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions.
The meaning of the assessment exercise to universities is great.
It allows them to demonstrate the quality and impact of their research work.
The Research Excellence Framework was the first exercise to assess the impact of research outside of academia i.e.
in society in general.
Impact was defined as âan effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academiaâ.
The value of great research, its training in original thinking and analysis and its ability to keep knowledge fresh and contemporary, to the nation and to the undergraduate and postgraduate student body is something that sets university degrees apart from those available outside of the university system.
In 2014 the REF revealed the quality and impact of UK research in universities.
Full details of the REF2021 can be found on the REF2021 website .

Health and wellbeing for life, for all
At Marjon, we believe everyone deserves to live a healthy, fulfilled life.

Our clinics are set up in the belief that education, self-reflection and social support can improve quality of life.
We work with individuals, helping them to manage their condition through community-based, sustainable education and support programmes.
Our approach is to encourage lifelong health and wellbeing through human connections in groupsâ¯andâ¯a focusâ¯on the people, rather than a disease or condition.

Marita: I'm really pleased to say that they've given me ways to manage my pain here.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/about-marjon/marjon-zero:
Marjon Zero is an exciting visionary project to make our university one of the greenest in the country, doing our bit to protect the planet.
Weâre committed to zero carbon by 2030.
At Marjon, we actively embed sustainability into everything we do.
We work collaboratively across disciplines and find innovative solutions to our world's complex problems.
We draw from the expertise of our Sustainability Team, SCION Research Group, Executive Leadership Team, and talented students.
Phase one of Marjon Zero is already complete.
In 2020 we installed approximately 2000 solar panels, saving 300 tonnes of carbon per year saved (tCO2e).
In phase one we also switched our lighting to energy efficient LEDs and installed five electric vehicle charging stations.
Phase two of Marjon Zero was completed in 2022.
This involved one of the biggest ground source heat pump installations in England, which will save 617 tonnes of carbon per year (tCO2e).
This is equivalent to the energy use from 65 homes, or burning 1260 barrels of oil or charging 66 million smartphones.
Marjon Zero will provide the campus with one of the cleanest and most renewable ways to heat our buildings and some of our accommodation.
This project is ground-breaking, with Marjon being the first University to implement a ground source heat pumps project of this size, meaning Marjon, its community and the surrounding areas are at the forefront of new sustainability initiatives in the race to net-zero carbon.
The project is enabled by grants from the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, to the value of Â£1.8m for solar panels and Â£3.5m for ground source heat pumps.
Decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide (CO2) output of the economy.
Currently, a wide range of sectors run largely on fossil fuels, which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal, oil or gas.
The carbon dioxide emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas , trapping in heat and contributing to global warming.
By using alternative sources of energy, industries can reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change.
A ground source heat pump is a central heating and cooling system designed to transfer hear from the groundâs upper layers.
This enables us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
It works by circulating a mixture of water and antifreeze around a loop of pipe which is buried in the ground.
The heat from the ground is absorbed into the fluid and then it passes through a heat exchanger into the heat pump.
This heat can then be used to heat radiators buildings, warm air or underfloor hearting systems and hot water.
They run constantly and are inexhaustible and virtually silent.
At Marjon, we believe we have a responsibility to achieve a sustainable campus for everyone in our community.
Plymouth Marjon University wishes to educate all campus users, and be an example of how you can live sustainably.
So, if you want to get involved with Marjon Zero, or other sustainability work, follow the links below.

In future phases of the Marjon Zero project weâll go on to retrofit current buildings and make our campus a greener space by expanding our green social spaces and the biodiversity around campus.
Here at Marjon weâre passionate about the planet.
Our ambition in everything we do is to improve lives for all, so weâre committed to doing our bit to protect against climate change and nature loss.
Weâre going to be a zero carbon campus by 2030.
To achieve this weâre working hard to reduce and remove our carbon dioxide, or CO2, output.
This is crucial because carbon dioxide emitted from using fuels like coal, oil or gas acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping in heat and contributing to global warming.
Weâve started our switch to clean and renewable sources of energy.
Itâs a multi-stage project and weâve dubbed it Marjon Zero.
Weâve already installed 2000 solar panels, saving 300 tonnes of carbon per year.
Weâre now installing 120 ground source heat pumps, to save a further 617 tonnes of carbon per year.
These will transfer heat from the ground that weâll then use to heat our buildings and hot water.
These two measures alone save the equivalent of the energy used by 100 homes.
Thatâs not all.
Weâve also moved to green electricity supplies, installed LED lights and introduced electric vehicle charging stations and an electric car ownership scheme for staff.
Marjon soon will be one of the greenest universities in the country.
By the time the ground source heat pumps are up and running in March 2022 our CO2 emissions will have dropped by 60% compared to 2020 levels.
But weâre not stopping there.
Weâre developing new sustainability initiatives including plans to retrofit our buildings to make them more energy-efficient, and to expand the green spaces and biodiversity on campus.
Weâre committed to doing our bit to protect the planet.

It offers university-level course work for apprentices in the South West aiming to qualify as: Assistant Practitioner (Healthcare) Nursing Associate Registered Nurse (Degree Apprenticeship) Youth Worker (Degree Apprenticeship) Ofsted praise The inspection took place in spring this year.
The report highlighted good performance in: working closely with employers to develop curricula that meet the needs of real-life jobs and the wider sector conducting regular curriculum reviews gathering feedback from apprentices and employers and making changes to enhance relevance and quality using specialist knowledge well to plan and teach in a way that helps apprentices swiftly build their knowledge designing assessments that are vocationally relevant using high-quality learning resources establishing a highly inclusive and supportive environment Student success In more good news, the Assistant Practitioner Apprenticeship achieved a 100% satisfaction score in the 2025 National Student Survey — for the second year in a row.
Apprenticeships are funded by the government and employers, and apprentices typically study one day a week.
150 students are currently undertaking apprenticeships at Marjon using a blended model of face-to-face and online learning.
Looking ahead Marjon supports both Higher Level and Degree Apprenticeships, the latter equivalent to Bachelor's or Master's degrees.
New apprenticeships for Specialist Teaching Assistants, Physiotherapists, Speech and Language Therapists and Teachers will be rolled out this coming year.
Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Provost, Professor Michelle Jones, said: “Marjon’s apprenticeship programme is playing an important role in driving regional ambition and progress, particularly in meeting the demand for highly-skilled healthcare workers in the South West.
Our apprentices learn with industry, and with our Gold-rated teaching they are opening up new careers for themselves.” Apprentice voices Robyn Conway, who completed the Assistant Practitioner Foundation Degree Apprenticeship at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Cumberland Centre Urgent Treatment Centre, said:  “All the modules in my course were helpful for my professional development.
It has made me more confident to lead situations and work more independently in my practice.
I now feel like a well-rounded Assistant Practitioner and comfortable in my work and abilities.” Jane Wickett, Apprenticeship Manager, said: “To be recognised by Ofsted as ‘Good’ in our first-ever inspection is wonderful validation.
Our apprentices particularly value the training they receive for the way it is tailored to reflect real-world challenges.
Some have not been in formal training or education for some time, and they all benefit from the structured support we give.
We look forward to ambitiously pushing ahead in expanding our provision in line with the needs of regional employers.” Want to further your career with Marjon’s apprenticeship programme?

Released: 12.08.25
From academy setback to championship pitch PE teaching student Dylan Jones has signed a professional contract with Norwich City FC —a testament to how determination and university-level support can turn sporting dreams into reality.
Released by Exeter City’s Academy at 16, the striker didn't give up.
He joined Plymouth Marjon University , training as a Secondary PE teacher while playing non-league football.
His breakthrough came after standout performances with Plymouth Parkway and Marjon's first team—and a successful trial where he scored twice for Norwich's U21s against Crystal Palace.
“Marjon’s Football programme helped my recent success in many way,” said Dylan.
“The opportunities you get to train three times a week and in games give you plenty of time to improve… the strength and conditioning offered is a massive help… you build great relationships with staff and teammates… a healthy environment which allowed me to strive and show my footballing ability.” Balancing Academics and Athletic Success Off the pitch, Dylan studied BEd Physical Education, part of a course with a 97% positivity rate in the 2025 National Student Survey.
As a BUCS league-winning player, he earned Fresher of the Year , became top scorer, and helped Marjon lift a League and Cup double in his first year.
Marjon’s decade-long partnership with Plymouth Argyle Community Trust also provides valuable industry placements and community project experience.
Darrel Harris, Head of Football at Plymouth Marjon University, said: “Dylan is an exceptional young man, a very talented player and an excellent example of never giving up on your dream… The odds at getting to a professional are so slim these days, and I cannot wait to see him develop even further in his career.” A Proven Launchpad for Talent Marjon combines elite coaching, personalized training, and top facilities with academic excellence.
In the 2025 NSS, the BA Football Coaching & Development scored 96% positivity, and BSc Sport Rehab & Conditioning achieved 100%.
Dylan now joins a growing list of Marjon athletes who’ve debuted on the professional stage—including footballer Jasmine Read, swimmer Ben Proud, rower Helen Glover, and diver Sarah Barrow.
Plymouth Marjon University is rated Gold overall and for student experience in the Teaching Excellence Framework 2023.

Information you share when you visit us or attend an event When you visit and meet with academics, you may choose to share more personal details such as joining a Facebook group or Whatsapp group for applicants or for a certain society.
This will mean that any data you share there is available to that group.
We would not share any prior personal data we have about you with that group.
You can choose to leave such groups at any time but you should be aware of the privacy policy of any channel used for this sort of communication.
Having your photo taken at an event We often have a photographer at events and we ensure they are clearly visible.
If you do not wish to appear in photographs you can register this at reception when you arrive or let us know in advance.
If you are asked by the photographer to have your picture taken you can decline.
If you want any photographs we have of you to be removed, you should contact the Data Protection Officer through the contact details at the back of this policy with this information: a) The date of the event b) A copy of the photo you want to be removed, including describing which person is you so that we can look for and remove other photographs too iv.
If you apply to the University after a visit If you subsequently apply to the University we will match this back with your visit data, but the latest personal data on your application form will supersede the information given when you visited.
We will contact you in line with the needs of your application, such as sending you offer letters, contacting you about Applicant Days and ensuring you are aware of “decline by default” dates.
This forms part of our contract with you when you apply to us rather than as part of consent for marketing purposes.
Retaining your data after a visit We retain your personal information securely for research purposes for up to six years in order to analyse changes in our visits and their effectiveness over time.
Any statistical reports we produce will not allow you to be identified, for example we might look at how enquiries change geographically over time by looking at postal sectors.
You can request that your data be entirely removed at any time using the contact details at the end of the privacy policy.
4.2 Alumni of the University i.
The information we maintain As part of our public task, we will retain records of your study at the University indefinitely, to ensure that if you need to prove your qualifications in the future we can help in this.
If you are an alumnus/a, the following data is transferred from your student record to the University Alumni database: Name, address, email, telephone numbers, date of birth, degree, subject and dates started and completed.
We may also include information such as whether you won any prizes or were a Student Ambassador.
We will update your contact details as requested in this database.
We will also update information such as your latest job or company you are working for, according to publically available data such as that on LinkedIn, newspaper articles, Royal Mail address files or BT phone directories.
We will also keep a record of information you have given us about how you wish to be contacted, such as whether you wish to share your story, to volunteer, donate or support us in any other way, or your bank details.
How we use this information and how long we keep it The information you provide and we acquire from other sources is used by the University to communicate with you for its marketing, promotional and fundraising purposes.

We consider the relationship with our alumni to be lifelong.
This means that we will maintain a record for you until such time you tell us that you no longer wish us to keep in touch.
In this instance we will delete the majority of your personal data but maintain basic personal data to ensure we do not inadvertently create a new record in the future.
We appreciate it if you let us know when your contact details change.

Accessibility Statement for marjon.ac.uk Introduction This accessibility statement applies to the website www.marjon.ac.uk .
This website is run by Plymouth Marjon University, which is a trading name of the University of St Mark & St John.
The website was developed in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA.
We believe that the web should be an open, inclusive and fair space for all.
We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
Our goal is to make this website easy to comprehend and accessible across devices from mobile phones to the largest of desktops.
That means you should be able to: Change colours, contrast levels and fonts Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software Access transcripts of our video content Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
How accessible this website is We know that some parts of this website are not fully accessible.
These include: Our internally developed forms and systems are not fully accessible with a screen reader, including the Open Day booking system, the Prospectus request form, the Apply Direct application, the online registration system, the ePay system and the graduation booking portal.
Some PDFs are not fully accessible, for example due to missing titles or heading tags.
There are a small number of navigation fixes required which could confuse a screen reader, or result in confusing readings, for example some pages are missing top-level headings; some links are not clear enough in terms of their purpose and some pages do not have the language defined.
Some video frames do not have a title.
There are a small number of appearance issues, for example some controls do not change appearance when selected and there are some examples of text which does not have very high contrast.
Some tables are not fully marked up, for example they do not have clear headers defined.
What we do about known issues We work to achieve and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standards, but it is not always possible for all our content to be accessible.
Where content is not accessible, we will state a reason, warn users and offer alternatives.
Feedback and contact information What to do if you can’t access parts of this website If you need information on this website in a different format you can contact us on the details below.
Email: marketing@marjon.ac.uk Phone: 01752 636700 We’ll consider your request and get back to you in five working days.
If you need information on our courses or applying to study at Marjon you can call +44 (0)1752 636890 (10am–4pm) or email admissions@marjon.ac.uk .
If you can’t view any of the maps you can call us on +44 (0)1752 636700 or email info@marjon.ac.uk for directions.
Our Contact page lists other departments you can call for information.
Reporting accessibility problems with this website We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website.
If you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or think we’re not meeting the requirements of the accessibility regulations, contact marketing@marjon.ac.uk .
Enforcement procedure The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.
2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).
If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) .
Contacting us by phone or visiting us in person We provide a text relay service for people who are D/deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment.
Some of our offices and classrooms have audio induction loops.
If you contact us before your visit we may be able to arrange a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter.
Find out how to contact us: Contact us | Plymouth Marjon University Technical information about this website’s accessibility Plymouth Marjon University is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.
2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
Compliance status This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard , due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed on our non-accessible content page.
Non-accessible content You can view the full list of accessibility non-compliances and exemptions for our website by following this link to our dedicated page .
Disproportionate burden Forms Some fieldsets don’t contain a legend Some items with the same name inside a fieldset aren’t wrapped Some form controls don’t have labels Some labels in the document fragment don’t point to valid IDs The purposes of some form fields aren’t identified programmatically Some of our form pages require zooming and 2D scrolling on small screens Some form controls don’t contrast sufficiently with their surroundings Our forms don’t allow users to quickly skip to content The frames some of our forms sit in don’t specify a title The custom tabbing order doesn’t always make sense Some controls don’t change appearance when they are selected The language of our form pages isn’t specified Some links on our forms may not be able to be used by screen readers Response: Some of our forms are created in-house and will be complex to fix.
We’ve assessed the workload and cost of this and we believe that fixing the forms as they stand would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
Where possible, we have migrated some of our forms to Microsoft Forms and Terminal 4 Forms, which are more accessible solutions.
Unfortunately this is not possible in all cases, especially where the data from the form is required to interact with our student database in order to provide a better experience to applicants.
In order to provide a long-term fix, our goal is to implement a CRM solution which will replace our forms built in-house, which will provide a fully accessible solution.
This is a significant project and we aim to complete it by December 2025.
In order to provide an alternative to these forms, we can support users to complete them.
Users can contact hello@marjon.ac.uk to arrange this support which would vary depending on the form required.
Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations Old PDFs We do not plan to amend non-essential PDFs or file formats which were created before 23rd September 2018 because they are exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations .
Live video We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
What we’re doing to improve accessibility We have engaged an accessibility service, Silktide, to provide real-time comprehensive accessibility information rather than single point in time audits.
This means we have constant and detailed feedback on fixes required, their priority and impact on the user, the number of them and where they are found.
We commit to working through these fixes in a logical and prioritised way, focusing on the impact to the user first, and retaining the service ongoing.
Updates on this accessibility tracking will be reported twice a year at the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Board.
Preparation of this accessibility statement This statement was first published on 19 September 2019, then reviewed on 19 October 2020.
It was comprehensively reviewed on 21 June 2022, 28 March 2023 and again on 29 March 2024.
This website was last tested on 29 March 2024, to ensure that this statement is up to date.
We used a real-time testing solution called Silktide.
Silktide categorises the accessibility concerns it finds in two different ways.
Some are detected automatically, so we know they require us to take action to remedy them.
Others are flagged but must be checked manually, so we have checked a sample of ten pages for each accessibility requirement and are confident that they did not occur in the sample.
We are using this approach because we recognise that websites are dynamic spaces.
We want to be sure that we are comprehensively fixing issues not only as they stand at one audit, but as they continue to arise.
We recognise that we can design in accessibility as standard, but as websites are amended it is very easy to lose accessibility through lack of deep expertise of editors; for example in simple writing styles, or in tagging pdfs.
The real-time, always-on audit means we have a running log of issues and can continually work in a prioritised and systematic way to fix them.

We'll give you opportunities to develop key skills, reflective practice, critical thinking, evidence informed teaching strategies and coaching and mentoring techniques that will take your teaching to the next level.
Towards the end of the masters you'll conduct a research project that addresses a professional teaching dilemma that you have, or problem that your organization is facing.
You'll evaluate and critically analyze the evidence and write recommendations for how this might resolve the issue.
So this inquiry project can have real value, not only improving your teaching practice, but also affecting change in your organisation.
You'll learn entirely online from high quality videos and reading materials, accessed via our virtual learning environments.
And you can expect personalized support from expert tutors.

In this session, weâre going to explore our perceptions, and maybe beliefs and assumptions, about education, but also about what we think teaching and learning is.
Why start with your perceptions of education?
Surely, youâre doing this Masters degree to hear about the right way of doing education?
Well, as education psychologist John Biggs said in this core educational text â How effectively we teach depends, first, on what we think teaching is.
If youâve come here to understand the science of education, then Iâm afraid youâll be disappointed.
Education, and the teaching and learning processes that support it, is not a science.
But wait!
Thereâs a statement, right there, that needs unpacking.
There are plenty of academics and theorists (weâll discover some of these later in this module) who thought exactly that â that education is a science and we can apply scientific principles to it.
But many theorists and researchers have taken issue with this â largely because they see education as such a deeply human process.
What we learn, how we 
learn, why we learn â have so much to do with our own lived

experiences.
This is the approach we take in this Masters programme â

weâll explore the many theories of learning but we will always invite

you to relate these back to your own practice
Let me ask you that question again - why are we starting with your

perceptions and experiences of education?
Well, one good reason to

try to uncover these perceptions is that often we get stuck teaching in

the same old way because thatâs how we were taught, and it worked

for us right?
Or thatâs what weâre comfortable with.
Or weâre getting

good results so why change?
Over time, we have developed our own

beliefs and assumptions about what âgood teachingâ is and how to do

it.
Letâs call these our personal âtheoriesâ of education.
Biggs & Tang go

on to say that all teachers have some theory of what they think

teaching is, even if they are not explicitly aware of that theory.
Teachersâ theories deeply affect the kind of learning environment they

create in their classrooms
Letâs unpack that quote a little - âeven if they are not explicitly awareâ â

chances are youâre not aware of your own theory, I certainly wasnât

until I started studying education in an academic context and reflecting

on my practice.
Your job in this session is to start to become more

explicitly aware of your own theories, based on your own experiences.
The second sentence bears repetition too â teachersâ theories deeply affect the kind of learning environment they create in their classrooms â think about that a bit.
They are saying that as teachers, our experiences and beliefs, and assumptions about what âgood teachingâ is, our âtheoriesâ, have a profound effect on how we set up our classrooms and how we go about our jobs as teachers.
And almost certainly on whether our students are learning or not.
It is important, then, vital - to bring these personal âtheoriesâ to the surface and examine them.
See if theyâre fit for purpose.
To begin to explore our personal theories of education (and weâll

continue to do this throughout this module), letâs start with our own

lived experiences of being educated.
All of us were learners once, and

youâve chosen to put yourself back in the role of learner again by

studying for this Masterâs.
I would argue that indeed we never stop

learning â I am learning so much more about education through

creating this Masterâs programme for you, for example.
Our

experiences of education are likely to be immensely diverse.
Let me

share my experiences with you.
I went to a large primary school when I was 7, we wore a uniform, lots

of sport and reading and maths, projects â my favourite time of all was

in the fourth and final year, where we were told we could choose our

own project topics â I was obsessed with The Beatles at that time, but

my teacher didnât think that was appropriate to do a project on a rock

band â so did the 1960s instead!
Loved itâ¦and it was my first

experience of truly independent and self-directed learning.
My secondary school was an all-girls school which I disliked, very

traditional, assemblies every morning, hymnbooks, lots of academic

study and homework.
My favourite teacher was my geography teacher

â she was fun, made the subject come alive, and always had time for

me.
I went to university in Wales and I loved it.
I was the first in my family

to go to university.
I was independent for the first time in my life, doing

what I wanted to do, making new friends, doing new things â but I was

taught by a group of academics who would stand at the front of a large

lecture hall and talk at me for an hour, sometimes two.
I donât

remember being asked what I thought about the topic or what Iâd read

and I dimly recall the pain of sitting in a silent exam hall, full of hay

fever, trying to remember what theyâd told me
When I came back to academia some years later to study for my Masters, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the learning experience had changed, on the whole.
It was more participatory, I was given choice, and I think importantly, I was asked to reflect on my learning â something Iâd never done before.
For me, these earlier experiences of education strongly influenced the teacher I am today.
I valued being given the choice to learn (not often enough!) and so now I believe in giving students independence in their own learning as often as I can.
I appreciated teachers who made the subject relevant and interesting, and I try and do the same as a teacher.
And I strive to create relationships with my students that are rooted in respect and understanding â just as I learnt best when I felt understood and respected as a student.
My experience on my Masterâs degree reminded me of the importance of providing a structure for mature learners, some of whom may not have studied for years.
Of course, youâll be able to judge me as a teacher as we go along, but for me â when I take a moment to reflect, I know this is my teaching approach and where I get most reward.
Now itâs your turn.
What were your experiences?
Think back to how

you were educated in school and then in college or university?
What

stands out for you?
What did you like/ dislike?
Can you remember

your favourite teacher?
What were their qualities?
How did they teach

you?
What did they do?
How did they relate to you as a pupil or

student?
Now think about what kind of teacher or educator you are, or might

be.
What is your teaching approach?
How have your experiences of

being educated influenced your teaching?
Finally, and this is a big question, so I'm going to leave it with you â

what do you think education is for?
What is its purpose?
Remember

your learning journal â I've written these questions down for you, and a

few others, to act as prompts to start you reflecting on your own

experiences and assumptions.
Have some fun with them and Iâll see

you in the next session.
I think itâs interesting from time to time to take stock in education and look at how far weâve come.
There are many factors that have come together to bring us to where we are today â in the previous lecture, I took you through a brief history of online learning.
We saw how one of the key moments in recent online education history, following the invention of the world wide web, came with the invention of the smartphone.
I remember when I was working at another University, in around 2014, we had a Learning Technology team whose job it was to spot trends coming and they flagged up the arrival of the smart phone into education, and how it would change everything.
None of us particularly believed it at the time.
They also spotted the importance of learner analytics, that is data about student attainment and engagement, put to use to enhance student success â something only achievable when every aspect of education has been shifted online.
I had to change my practices, with the arrival in close succession of online assessment and marking (resisted by many at the time) and the requirement to make lectures available online via Panopto (again, resisted at the time).
Since that time, there has been an exponential growth of digital capability since the invention of smartphone â and with it, the radical overhaul of the potential of online education following this âdigital turnâ.
Then Covid-19 hit us in early 2020 and suddenly everyone in

education had to move everything online, in our case at Marjon

within just one week.
After decades of resistance, reluctance,

exciting new projects that later failed, in one week the argument

had been won â the time had passed for any kind of debate,

online learning was essential in this modern world and it was here

to stay.
Where are we now?
Iâd like to make a number of points to answer

that question â you may be able to think of more from your own

recent experience.
o Firstly, as weâve seen in the previous lectures, online learning

and teaching has a long and convoluted history, one that it is

important for us to acknowledge â and it comes with a

corresponding body of academic research and literature that we

most certainly need to learn from.
Weâll dip into this during this
module and I invite you to read around the topic and find research relevant and useful to you in your own teaching context.
o Secondly, we can summarise the principles of online learning that have their roots in the early days of distance learning: an emphasis on social justice, a focus on people and on interaction, and anchored in the concept of teaching quality, first and foremost, whatever the context.
o The third point Iâd like to make â and itâs been made by many people since early 2020 â is this.
As educators, we have to recognise that access to online learning is not equal.
We might be forgiven for thinking that this is only a problem for certain parts of the world, in the Global South for example.
But a survey by the National Union of Students in the UK in July 2020 revealed a shocking 27% of students in higher education were unable to access online learning.
Others face challenges of finding a safe or quiet space to work from home, poor internet connection (still an issue in rural areas), or a lack of necessary hardware - no computers or smart phones, effectively left out of the digital world, existing in what came to be known as âdigital povertyâ.
In the Canvas 2020 report, Student Success in Higher Education, access to technology is identified as a âcritical enablerâ.
o The next point, linked in some ways to the last one, is that remote and online learning only serves to heighten those disparities already existing in face-to-face education.
Again, according to the Canvas report (2020), just 11% of students from lower socio-economic classes found it easy to stay engaged compared to 48% of those in higher classes.
This huge gap in student engagement echoes Light et alâs work on âlearning gapsâ and begs the question, what can we as educators do to ensure engagement is more evenly spread across our student demographic?
o It has become an urgent priority then to develop and promote digital literacies as identified by Carrington & Robinson, in 2009.
We must debunk the myth of the âdigital nativeâ - these are students born since 1990 who have grown up with digital technology from a young age â we must be wary of lumping our learners together under the Net Gen or Gen K umbrella
It is time to return our attention to the two fundamental concepts behind online learning and teaching = teaching quality, whatever the context and technology is a tool not a master.
In the remainder of this lecture, I want to pose the question: are

online pedagogies different to face-to-face pedagogies?
Weâll

address this question in more detail in chapter two but Iâd like to

leave you with some thoughts from two writers on online

pedagogy Helen Beetham and Rhona Sharp.
The title of their 2014 book â Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital

Age â available to you as an e-book in the Marjon library â seems

to suggest there is a difference between online and face-to-face

pedagogy.
They suggest there are two perspectives â one in which

technology is only a tool that makes no difference to how we

teach â and another that argues that digital technology is key and

warn against the danger of relying on the simplistic âold

pedagogies, new toolsâ philosophy.
They argue that this new

digital world requires a paradigm shift â a wholesale shift in

worldview or perspective - towards a digital pedagogy.
They

suggest that we need to rethink education in its entirety within

this new context.
In 2014, this seemed like a radical proposition

but now, perhaps itâs exactly what we need.
Iâll leave you with their words:

âPapyrus and paper, chalk and print, overhead projectors,

educational toys and television, even the basic technologies of

writing were innovations once.
The networked digital computer,

and its more recent mobile and wireless counterparts are just the

latest outcomes of human ingenuity that we have at our disposal.
It is true that none of these technologies has changed human

beingsâ fundamental capacities to learn, if learning is understood

in purely cognitivist terms.
But they have profoundly changed

how ideas and practices are communicated, and what it means to

be a knowledgeable or capable person.â

Carly: My favourite thing about teaching might sound a bit strange, but I really love Monday mornings.
So sometimes on a Sunday you think, "Oh, I just don't want to go to work," and that's a normal feeding that everyone feels, but as soon as I walk through the door and the children are happy to see me, and they're skipping down the path, ready to find out what's happening that day, I'm ready for them.
And I'm ready to see their progress in their learning.
Paul: When I'm doing PE with the children, and we're learning how to catch and they catch the ball for the first time, a little girl ran up to me last week and she was like, "I caught it, Mr.
Dixon.
I caught it." It's those moments why I do teaching.
Carly: I looked around lots of different universities, and I liked the size of Marjon.
It felt really warm and welcoming when I walked in, and I quite liked that it was around that quad in the middle.
And I saw lots of other students chilling out in the quad, and having their lunch and walking between lectures, and I thought that's a place that I'd like to be.
Paul: The most helpful part for me, that Marjon helped me with my teaching, was the placement, and it was allowing and working alongside me to produce the placements where I felt I really wanted to develop my own skills.
Carly: I had three really good placements and really different placements.
They made sure I was in different key stages each time.
So my first one was in key stage two, then key stage one, and then a different class within key stage one, which was really, really useful, because I could see the breadth of the curriculum and see how children progress through different skills.
I also really enjoyed the fact that the groups in the seminars were really small.
And I got to know my fellow students in my group very, very well, and we stayed in that group the whole way through the three years.
So I felt very secure and comfortable to share ideas and any problems I thought I had.
If I was to give advice to a new teacher starting the primary course At Marjon, I would say make the most of your placements and the most of all of the experience that the teachers have there.
You'll have newly qualified teachers within your school.
You'll have teachers with real specialisms in their subjects, and teachers who have just a wealth of experience because of the years they've been teaching.
Ask them questions, shadow what they do, and find out as much as you can, because it'll all help when you finally have your very own class.
Paul: If someone was worrying about whether it's Marjon or another university, I would say, I ended up choosing Marjon.
It was down to the sizes of the seminars and the lecture sizes, and the ability to have that one-on-one contact time with the tutors, when I was in dissertation writing, as well.
There was every opportunity that we had there.
And you could take as much time as you needed with the tutors who are really available.
I think it was that availability that really pulled me to Marjon.
And that was why I ended up choosing Marjon, it was down to the sizes of the seminars, the lecture sizes and that availability to have one-on-one contact time with the tutors, even when I was doing dissertation writing as well.
So that's why I would recommend someone else go to Marjon.
Carly: If someone was sitting on the fence about going to Marjon and training to be a teacher, I would say, think about what you really want and do the best thing for you.
But if you want somewhere that's small and welcoming and really supportive, and you can get the most out of your course and the most out of your lecturers, then I would recommend Marjon.

I work for the child sexual exploitation team.
So, I work in a very different way to the way I've worked historically.
So, youth work is normally quite informal, it's about young people, helping them to make informed choices.
In that sense, my role is very different.
A lot of young people are forced to work with me, it'll be part of their child protection plan.
There are two of us that are youth workers in the team, and we work with around about 15 young people each at any one given time.
Aged between 10 to 18, who are extreme high risk of, or currently experiencing, child sexual exploitation.
So for that reason, they tend to be on child protection plans and they come to us either just before they go to child protection or just after.
So we make part of a multi agency team that supports that young person.
For me, it's all about the one to one work.
You can have a really bad day, and then your last session of the day will be a young person and they just let you know they've made a really healthy choice, and it can be something as simple as not running away last night, not self-harming last night, not taking an overdose last night.
And you get that real buzz and you think, "Yeah, this is what it's all about.
Nevermind the paperwork that I'm going to be up to really late doing." It's that sort of stuff.
I was a mature student going back.
I had a job, I had to work financially.
Even if you took away those barriers, I would pick Marjon now, I would pick it again, if I was 18.
Uni just gave me the confidence I needed and like I said, I didn't think I'd ever be able to go to uni, and in that first semester, I remember getting out of my little Dictaphone in my first ever lecture, putting it on, thinking "I can't miss a word.
If I miss a word, I'm going to fail, be thrown off the course.
They're going to realize I don't belong here." And I can say the tutor was really good at giving me the confidence to carry on.
And I did well.
It's one of the things, other than my children obviously, and my husband, it's one of the things I'm most proud of.
I came out with a first and that was just such an amazing feeling.
I'd worked really hard and got that.
And then since then, it's kind of like with all that theory, I can now sit in meetings, whereas before I'd go along to a meeting and I was just a youth worker.
Now I am a youth worker, I'm not just, I can hold the same academic conversations, use the same language as other professionals and not feel intimidated or undervalued in a way that I maybe did before.
I'm not sure if that was a confidence thing, but uni certainly gave me the language to be able to have this job and the understanding of the law, and like I said, all that theoretical stuff that you, well you're sitting in class, you're thinking "Really?
Really?" But actually underpins everything we do.
So going to Marjons opened so many doors.
I was able to apply for jobs that I hadn't been able to apply for before because of the qualification, the JNC.
And five years ago, I'd have never have thought I could have ever had this job.
So that's what going to Marjons gave me.

The course offers flexibility for busy professionals to engage in postgraduate study.
It can be studied either part-time or full-time at our Plymouth campus or part-time at our Marjon University Cornwall in Truro to fit in with professional and family commitments.
Our MA Education is taught in partnership with Teaching School Alliances, Multi-Academy Trusts, SCITT partners, Diocesan offices, military, health, sport, outdoor education, local authorities and a wide range of other employers and organisations throughout the South-West and beyond.
The course ethos is informed, first and foremost, by a renowned student-centred approach focusing on developing and enhancing professionals’ practice and specific subject expertise, which allows you to identify your own research focus.
This course
is a development,
if you like, of undergraduate studies.
It allows the consolidation of theory
and practice in education.
So it generally attracts
people who have worked in education
for a number of years.
Whether thatâs school
teachers, headteachers, leaders
within schools,
within colleges, nursery settings,
people who want to learn a little bit
more about education.
And the education itself
can be formal or informal.
We attract
a lot of students with diverse approaches
and research ideas as well.
So I think with the staff team
and the expertise
within the staff team
and also within
the class
setting in terms
of the students experience,
because we get so many different
students from different areas,
the diversity of the discussions
are fantastic.
So it really helps to draw on
that knowledge
that they already have
and then build their schemas of knowledge
around education that takes it further.
So some students look at the M.A.
to go into leadership positions
within an educational establishment.
So they may well become a lead
within the PE department
or lead within the nursery setting,
or possibly in a middle management
senior leadership
within colleges as well,
and or for headteachers as well.
So it's not limiting that.
However, so far my experience has been
that it's more
about individual development
and that self-development, that
the students can realize
something else,
that they didn't know about themselves
and that they can do it.
And I think there is that
that keenness, if you like, to learn
more about the world.
Okay, I've done this.
I've got my my undergraduate degree.
I've worked for a few years.
What's next?
And I think there is that
that passion that drives
to learn about education.
And also because
of the nature of the course,
you can specialize the subject areas.
You look at and research into.
Because of that, I believe
students become empowered
by that self knowledge,
but also in that particular
area of research or study
that maybe hasn't been looked at
and it may well
link to that practice or not.
So it might be just,
you know,
a little bit
of a topic
that's sort of been
mulling in the back of their minds.
You know,
I really want to look into that.
I t's always fazed me.
I'd like to know
a little bit more about that.
And so that enables them to
become a specialist in that area.
At Marjon Plymouth,
we offer the M.A.
with all three pathways
and those three pathways,
or the generic pathway
where you focus on education, you've
then got
to the leadership
coaching leadership pathway
and then you've also got
the disability pathway
and all three pathways give you and me,
but it allows you to then
focus on those specialisms
a little bit more,
you know,
and it tailors to interest at the moment.
our Disability Pathways,
for example, is incredibly popular,
and I think that says something
about our culture
and society at the moment.
With all three of those courses
here at Plymouth,
we offer them full and part time.
So full
time is over the course of one year
where you will have
what we currently have
timetabled sessions, a twilight session
every every three weeks say
through the year.
Plus we have Saturday workshops.
If you're studying part time
you would study a mixture of both
depending on the semester
over a two year period.
Marjon has a unique community feel
the small classes,
the fact that tutors know students' names.
There's an ethos that's very Marjon
and that acceptance and kindness.
And I think that when you're
looking for somewhere
to feel that you belong
Marjon is that place.

Let's ask somebody who's a little more mature for their views on this studio.
John, what do you think of this studio?
And how much would you have liked it when you were a student many centuries ago?
âWell, John, I'd have absolutely loved these sorts of facilities when I was a student.
As you say, it was a long time ago, but I actually started my broadcasting career on a university radio station.
We had nothing like the equipment that is here.
I would have crawled over broken glass to have had equipment like this.
It's absolutely fantastic.
I love it.â So if you're thinking of studying journalism, whatever form of journalism that you're interested in, come and study it with us here at Plymouth Marjon University.

You might have felt compelled to teach for as long as you can remember, or maybe you see teaching as a chance to start afresh in a rewarding career.
Either way this guide is here to help, with trainee teachers, qualified teachers, teacher trainers, and other experts from the education sector all sharing their experiences.
The guide will help you to figure out if teaching is for you.
It breaks how to get into teacher training into steps and is packed with tips for every stage of the journey, from making your application shine, to going into the classroom and starting your first teaching role.
Who was your favourite teacher?
Youâve got one, havenât you?
What did they do for you?
What makes you remember them?
Thatâs the thing, as a teacher you get the chance to inspire people and make a difference, every day.
Every day.
Why be a teacher?
As a teacher youâve got great career prospects, and a very portable job, one that will keep you close to home or take you around the world, depending on what you want to do.
We asked our qualified teachers why they teach and the reasons range from great job satisfaction, to seeing children grow in confidence, to love of learning, to lots of laughs and never being lost for a funny story.
Many teachers told us thereâs nothing to beat that âlight bulbâ moment when something clicks for a pupil and you can both feel the progress theyâre making.
Itâs a rewarding role, and stable one that comes with a competitive salary too.
In England and Wales, a qualified teacher starts at the lowest point of the nationally agreed pay scale.
In England (excluding London) and Wales a teacher will earn between £30,000 and £46,525 per year.
A headteacher in England (excluding London) and Wales will earn between £53,380 and £131,056 per year.
Teachers in London receive extra weighting as it is more expensive to live there.
For more details see the teachers’ pay scale on the Get Into Teaching website.
Schools develop their own pay scales to attract and retain teachers.
Teachers’ pay rises are linked to excellent performance and taking on extra responsibilities, not to length of service.
While we're talking money, you’ll also want to check out government funding for teacher training courses .
This changes every year depending on the current situation in terms of subject skills shortages.
Also, all trainee teachers, whether on undergraduate or postgraduate courses, are eligible to apply for student finance .
You might already have noticed that there a lot of routes into teaching.
Choosing the right one is quite simple once you get into it, we promise.
The best route for you is determined by two key factors, these are the qualifications you already have and how certain you are that you want to teach .
So, which route to go for?
You need a degree with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) to teach in UK maintained schools (i.e.
schools managed by the local authority).
Academies and free schools are not managed by the local authority and are not required to employ teachers with QTS however, most do require it.
So you'll need QTS for most teaching jobs.
There are different routes to achieving QTS, depending on whether you are starting training with or without a degree.
If you already have any undergraduate degree you can apply for a postgraduate teacher training course to gain QTS.
The most popular option is a Postgraduate Certificate in General Education (PGCE) .
This is a full-time intensive course and you’ll achieve QTS in one year.
Some PGCEs require trainees to spend more time on campus than others.
These courses might be known as ‘campus-based’ PGCEs.
Other courses deliver the teacher training curriculum more flexibility and provide less campus-based teaching.
These course are sometimes described as ‘school based’.
You can train as a primary teacher with a degree in any subject at 2:2 or above, while to train as a secondary teacher you’ll need a degree in a subject related to the one you want to teach, again at 2:2 or above.
All trainee teachers need GCSE English and Maths and grade 4 or C and primary trainees need the same in GCSE Science too (double or separate subjects is fine).
Why not check out our teacher training courses or read more to help you choose between a campus-based or a school-based PGCE?
In some cases, you can also take a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course to add a second secondary subject to your bow, for example if your degree is in French then you might add Spanish, or if your degree is in Chemistry, then you might add Physics.
If you don’t yet have an undergraduate degree, you’ll need to get one.
Your options are:
An undergraduate teacher training course with QTS is typically intensive and full-time for three years.
If you’re certain that you want to teach and can meet the relatively high entry requirements (typically about BBC at A-level or DMM for BTEC) then a course with QTS could be just right for you.
Some options include BEd Primary Education or BEd Secondary Education with PE or Maths and Science.
But there are lots of good reasons to take a non-QTS course too:
Remember you need to follow any degree without QTS with a postgraduate degree with QTS if you ultimately want to become a teacher.
If you want to become an Early Years Teacher , then you have two options - Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS).
But the one you choose sets you on a very different career path.
QTS enables you to teach reception class in maintained schools.
EYTS enables you to teach in most Early Years settings including nurseries and preschools but not in maintained schools.
You don’t need any school experience to apply for teacher training.
But while teaching is very rewarding, it isn't easy.
Teaching is demanding, you’ll be teaching in class and doing other work outside of those times.
It’s a really good idea to go into a school to see if teaching is right for you.
You have lots of options for getting a sense of what it is like to work in schools.
They range from shadowing a teacher, to volunteering with children to paid roles like after-school club helper or mealtime assistant.
Meanwhile teaching assistants are uniquely positioned to get a taste for life as a teacher and often excel after making the move from teaching assistant to teacher, check these tips for getting a job as a teaching assistant .
To be accepted on a teacher training course with QTS youâll need to submit a written application, and if this is good enough then youâll be invited to an interview, to assess your suitability to teach.
All teacher training applications go through the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
The Admissions Tutors will be looking for aptitude and passion for teaching as well as school experience, so they can be sure you know what youâre getting into and are likely to stay the course.
A personal statement for teacher training needs to include:
Tutors want to know not just what you did, but how and why you did it.
Theyâll be looking out for self-awareness and commitment.
And they are mega hot on grammar and spelling, as youâd expect if theyâre picking the next generation of teachers.
Take time to edit and proofread your personal statement, and then ask someone else to check it over in case youâve missed anything.
We asked Kate Brimacombe, Associate Professor of Education and Associate Director of the Teacher Education Partnership at Plymouth Marjon University, what she is looking for in a personal statement for teacher training:
âIt's really lovely to get something that's individual and firstly I want to see that passion for wanting to work with children.
You absolutely can get that across - it comes off the page.
âI see your experience and grades elsewhere so donât recap those but show me your personality and your drive to be a teacher.
How people do that varies and so itâs that individuality Iâm looking for.
"Youâre at the start of a long journey so I'm also looking for independence, motivation, and self-reliance.
I need to feel your commitment because teacher training is Monday to Friday, nine to five, plus assignments and reading on top.
I want to see you understand those expectations and have that fire in your belly to want to make a difference in children's lives.â
You might think that your references are out of your control, but they are not.
A reference can make or break a teacher training application; you need to engage with your referees for good references.
You need two referees and one of them must be a teacher at a school where you work or volunteer.
If you currently work at a school one should be the Headteacher.
If you work somewhere other than a school one should be your employer as they can comment on your character and potential.
If you recently left university, one should be a member of staff there.
First ask your referees if they are willing to be your referee and if they think youâve got the potential to be a good teacher.
Next you need to arm them with all the arguments as to why youâll be a good teacher, they probably donât know everything you do.
Back to Kate for more on this: "The more information the better.
A good reference just doesn't say âyes they were a student and Iâve known them for two yearsâ as that doesnât reassure me about anything.
I really value their insight and a different perspective, for example it helps when the referee describes your personal qualities or discusses your work with children or other learners.
"Choose your referees wisely.
If youâre coming from a big class and donât really know your referee, then you need to get talking to them."
A reference that is too brief wonât help you so gently explain to the referees that their references really do matter.
Tell your referees about your motivations, your school experience or other relevant experience and why you think youâd be a good teacher.
Set out the personal qualities youâre going to bring to the role.
Provide them with examples to back up everything you talk about.
Follow up your conversation with a thank you email and in it recap the key points, so theyâve got them readily available when the times comes from them to write your reference.
You get an interview when your written application and referees suggest that you have the potential to teach.
Universities only have so many teaching placements to go around and they use interviews not only to check your suitability to teach, but to pick the best candidates.
Firstly, letâs go over how to ace your teacher training interview .
Teacher training interviews typically include: A tour or virtual tour of the university (or school for School Direct) An overview of the course Meeting some of the tutors youâll be learning from, and perhaps current trainees An individual interview and sometimes a group interview Pre-work, youâll usually be asked to prepare something on a topic related to teaching and come ready to discuss, present or talk about it with the interviewers The university that you are interviewing with will provide a full agenda and timings.
First impressions count and youâll go a long way by dressing smartly, simply try to look like a teacher.
It shows the interviewers that youâre taking it seriously.
If you are interviewing for PE teacher training check with the university if you should wear, or bring, sports clothes.
Keep in mind at interview all the qualities that make a good teacher.
Try to mention them, with examples where you can as interviewers will be looking for these qualities.
Teachers need to be strong communicators, able to engage and lead their class.
But teaching isnât all about talking, itâs about listening to your pupils and looking for non-verbal cues.
Itâs also about being part of the staff team, in schools you must be a team player, ready to share your experiences with the rest of the teaching team.
Youâll likely do a group exercise so your interviewers can see how you interact with other people.
Your interviews want to know what motivates you and what makes you tick as a teacher.
Teacher training interview questions are designed to find out the following things about you: How you've got to this point?
Why now?
And for secondary applicants, why this subject?
What strengths you think you bring to teaching?
How do you work?
Can you work collaboratively?
What motivates you?
Are you resilient?
What do you know about current issues in education?
What do you know about the national curriculum?
You may be asked to prepare a lesson plan.
It doesnât have to be a professional one yet, but it does need to be well thought out.
It should address key questions like: What class would you teach?
What would you teach them?
What would they know by the end that they didn't know before?
How would you go about it?
What would progress look like?
How would you measure that?
And what would you teach next?
Also, if youâre interviewing for secondary teaching, youâll usually be asked to present on your subject.
This is a chance for you to demonstrate your enthusiasm and subject knowledge.
Teacher training interviews typically include:
The university that you are interviewing with will provide a full agenda and timings.
Teacher training interview questions are designed to find out the following things about you:
We asked Julie Stevens, course leader for PGCE Secondary Education and School Direct Lead at Plymouth Marjon University, what she is looking for when interviewing aspiring teachers: âIf you're passionate about your subject, you'll tell me that your subject is the most important subject in the world.
And then tell me why.
You may have great ideas about how to teach it, and be able to relate it to everyday life.
Why do young people need to know that and how will it help them in their future lives?â.
Change is constant in teaching, so youâll need to be flexible, likewise youâll be teaching pupils of different ages and abilities who have different learning styles, so theyâll be looking for adaptability too.
Teachers also need to be able to connect and this can take many forms, from using practical activities to bring lessons to life, to recognising that everyone learns differently, to having the empathy and patience to keep everyone on track and challenged in a way that works for them.
Reflective practice is taught in every teacher training course, being aware of it will help you impress at interview.
Reflective practice is when a teacher reflects on past events with a view to improving their future teaching performance; it is something youâll do continuously for all of your teaching career.
There are many models of reflective practice but essentially all set out a process in which you consider something you have been involved with, seek to understand it, and then learn from it.
There are two types of reflective practice: Reflection-in-action is where the educator reflects on their actions in the moment, possibly when something is not working so well.
You do this to quickly improve the situation.
Reflection-on-action is retrospective.
It sees the educator reflect after an event has already taken place; itâs deliberate and evidence based, considering feedback, research, and theory.
Sounds good?
It really is.
This said the ability to reflect on what, why and how why you do things, and then adapt to be better, doesnât come easy.
It is a challenge to be impartial and open about your own experience.
Youâll be expected to combine self-reflection with learning from other educators.
This could be by asking others about the ways they do things and why, coaching and mentoring, observing or shadowing other educators, or networking online (try #EduTwitter ).
There are two types of reflective practice:
Get the guide
You’re in, you’ve got your teacher training offer (woohoo!).
What next?
We'll now explore some elements that are common to all teacher training courses - these are going on teaching placements and moving into your first teaching job.
If you find this helpful then check out the teacher training survivial guide for even more info.
This is the moment you’ve been waiting for.
Real students.
While teaching placements vary from course to course, any postgraduate teacher training course offers two teaching placements in different schools and undergraduate courses have more.
To start with you can expect a week or so of induction where you observe the classes you will be teaching.
This will be an essential time to watch how the group works together and what the class dynamics are like, to help you plan your future lessons for them.
You’ll likely do a pupil pursuit too; this means you’ll shadow a student for a day to see the different experiences they have across their various teachers and subjects.
You’ll also get to observe expert teachers.
You want to watch the best teachers in the school, they don’t need to teach the same subject as you.
Observe how they do assessments, how they question the students, how they instruct the students and how they interact with their teaching assistants.
Make sure to ask to observe someone with exceptional behavioural management skills and remember, the more you watch the more you’ll learn.
You will move on to participate in some team teaching.
This will mean the class teacher will begin the lesson, let you come and teach a section, and then they’ll return to close the class.
This way the experienced teacher is there and sets things up ready to teach your section.
From here you will then be asked to do solo lessons where you are responsible for managing the class and the teaching.
The class teacher will be present during your solo lessons, so you’ll never be alone; they’ll only help if asked or if they feel the need to step in.
If you're teaching secondary, then your first solo teaching class will most likely be with Year 7; you’ll stay observing Years 10 and 11 for longer.
Primary trainees could be asked to solo teach any year group.
Teacher recruitment runs on a whole different timescale to pretty much any other job.
You need to know how it works so as not to get caught out.
Wait until youâve got your degree and youâll be too late.
Many schools start to recruit for September in January, with most teaching jobs being advertised from March to late May and the last few roles gone by early July.
But your teacher training course likely ends in July, so youâll likely be applying of your first teaching job ahead of qualifying as a teacher.
This can feel a little wild if youâre on a one-year route into teaching, as youâre applying for jobs when youâre only halfway into your teacher training.
But try to just go with it, and remind yourself that future employers will totally understand, after all, theyâve been there themselves.
A strong application for a first teaching job will express the following things, backing up your words with relevant real-life examples:
Before you write anything read through the job description or person specification.
These outline exactly the qualifications, knowledge, experience, and skills required for the role.
Think of it as all the criteria that the school is going to be shortlisting against and aim to show how you meet every one.
To save time youâll want to write a standard application that you can reuse but make sure to customise it for every school.
The team there will care deeply about their school and their pupils, theyâll want to see the same coming from you.
Find out what you can about the school and then showcase how your experience maps to their school community.
You can do this by checking out the school website, doing a Google news search for the school, and by using the governments Compare Schools portal to see their pupil demographics, the latest exam and test results, and Ofsted reports.
A great application will give your future employers an insight into who you are and what you stand for.
You can get this across by outlining why you wanted to get into teaching and by telling them a little about your experience of teacher training, for example by outlining the aspects that you found to be the challenging, enjoyable, and rewarding.
See our article on how to apply for your first teaching job for more detailed tips on where to find a teaching job and on how to structure your job application.
Mentoring encourages and nurtures people to manage their own learning so that they develop their skills and improve their performance.
The special thing about mentoring is that itâs a reciprocal relationship.
Everyone benefits in successful mentoring relationships.
The mentee gets support on their journey to becoming the best teacher they can be while the mentor, through exploring the development needs of the mentee, reflects on their own practice and is able to view their own practice through a critical lens.
Mentoring is well established in teacher training, for example if you train to teach at Marjon you would have a mentor to support you.
Mentoring has been proven to boost the retention of new teachers and so the new Early Career Framework (ECF) requires that all new teachers have a mentor for two years after they qualify.
The key to a positive mentoring relationship is establishing trust between mentor and mentee.
Itâs a collaborative process that requires commitment and openness.
So, what does an effective mentoring relationship look like?
There are a number of mentoring models that can be used by mentor and mentee to help structure their conversations.
One is the GROW model; it works like this:
â¢ Goal.
What does the mentee want to achieve?
What routes might you take?
â¢ Reality.
What is the current situation?
What has been tried already and what did we learn from it?
â¢ Options .
What are the options?
Look for more than two!
â¢ Win commitment or Way forward .
Set the next goal.
Marjon trainees are mentored in line with Gibbsâ reflective cycle, first set out by Graham Gibbs in 1988.
It is an excellent framework for examining experiences and thanks to its cyclic nature lends itself well to repeated experiences, like teaching.
It has five stages:
Description – describing the situation in terms of what, why, where, when and who
Feelings – exploring your own feelings before, during and after the situation, as well considering the likely feelings of the other people who were involved
Evaluation - look objectively at what approaches worked and which ones didn't
Conclusions – ask questions like:
Action – agree some actions and plan to implement and later review them
You’ll typically also agree the terms of the mentoring agreement, this is where mentor and mentee sign up to commitments around the boundaries of the mentoring relationship.
These commitments tend to include a shared understanding around the roles in the relationship and cover confidentiality, frequency and duration of meetings.
You, the mentee, drive the mentoring relationship and take actions to drive your own development and call on guidance from the mentor.
You’ll naturally have lots of questions and ultimately, you’re the one responsible for finding the answers and developing your own self-learning.
It’s also important to remember that while you might be talking about quite personal things this is always a professional relationship and forum for professional discussion.
This is what you should expect from your mentor, they will:
The mentorâs role is to move the relationship to a place where the mentee achieves independence, and is no longer reliant on the mentor.
The mentor needs to support the mentee to a stage where they can say âI'm standing with you, let's learn togetherâ.
One example could be the mentee is struggling to manage the class behaviour then the mentor might model some strategies, direct the mentee to work observe teachers in action, and engage in some reading and research.
The mentee does this, develops an action plan and puts it into place.
Then mentor and mentee then come back together to evaluate and reflect on the impact of what they've done, and they set new actions based on the outcome.
So, it becomes a reflective cycle.

The funny thing about being a teacher is that you’re always learning.
Learning as you go from your colleagues, learning from your students but also by actively pursuing your own professional development.
9 minute read
This concept of the teacher as a learner is at the core of this guide.
Developed with the help of leading experts from the education sector, it explores a range of concepts which you can draw on to enrich your teaching practice.
It has a particular focus on the wellbeing and is packed with practical ideas you can try out in the classroom.
As Robert John Meehan, dubbed the âVoice of the American teacherâ, put it: "Your life as a teacher begins the day you realise you are always a learner."
You teach because you care about children, about their happiness now and their success in future.
But sometimes itâs not as straightforward as simply getting on with teaching, because a childâs wellbeing can be impacted by various factors, such as physical or mental health disabilities, which impact their learning as well as their experience of the social side of school.
This in turn can impact their success.
No two children are the same, so the challenges and solutions will always be a bit different.
Wellbeing.
Thatâs happily something weâre talking about a lot more.
But what exactly is it?
The governmentâs Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have described it as âa positive physical, social and mental state; it is not just the absence of pain, discomfort and incapacity.
It requires that basic needs are met, that individuals have a sense of purpose, and that they feel able to achieve important personal goals and participate in societyâ.
As a teacher sooner or later you are going to encounter complex wellbeing issues, ones that you canât deal with alone.
Your role as the teacher is to help the child, and their family, to get the support they need.
You can be a catalyst, playing your part to activate specialist support services.
Some families find they must fight very hard to get their child the help they need to thrive.
A supportive teacher in their corner can really help them to navigate the system to access the expert support that their child needs.
When the appropriate services are put in place to support the childâs wellbeing it maximizes their success and minimises negative experience.
You can make a huge difference.
According to the Mental Health Foundation, mental health problems affect around one in six children.
They include depression, anxiety ,self-harm and behavioural problems, and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives.
Mental health conditions in children and young people can often be treated, with the right help, especially when there is early detection and intervention.
The opening line of Promoting children and young peopleâs mental health and wellbeing 2019 , a report by Public Health England and the Department for Education, reads: â Mental health matters because a childâs emotional health and wellbeing influences their cognitive development and learning as well as their physical and social health and their mental wellbeing in adulthood.
â
The report advocates for a whole school and college approach to mental health and wellbeing.
It seeks to wrap resilience into the curriculum, enable student voices to influence decisions and champion âan ethos and environment that promotes respect and values diversityâ.
One whole school approach to this is that of trauma informed schools.
In these schools, members of staff are trained specifically to support children and young people with trauma or mental health conditions.
Their role is to support the child in dealing with barriers to learning.
For example, all schools in Cornwall now have teachers who have attended for wellbeing training, equipping them to better help children and young people to build resilience and mental wellbeing.
Whatever your school approach to wellbeing, there are many practical things you as a teacher can wrap into your own practice that will immediately start making an difference to your children.
To understand the child mental health situations you see, it helps to have a basic understanding of some of the key theories that relate to child mental health and how they apply to school settings.
It not what a child does that matters, but why they do it.
Each child is an individual so to support them you need to get to know them.
Gone are the days, we hope, when some adults would simply dismiss children as ânaughtyâ.
It is now much better understood that consistent defiant, disruptive and unkind behaviour could be signs of a mental health struggle.
Equally behaviour is often learnt and it takes time and encouragement to change it.
It isnât necessarily easy to know whether a child is angry or upset about something for a while but essentially coping or experiencing mental health issues.
But there are techniques to help you work it out.
The first step in supporting children with mental health conditions in schools is getting to know them.
This enables you to spot significant changes in a childâs behaviour and to name the emotions youâre seeing.
What are they feeling?
What are their triggers?
Why are they are behaving as they are?
As a teacher you're part of a team and your school will have a process for supporting children with mental health conditions.
Itâs crucial to know that process and to note any concerns so that collectively the school team sees the bigger picture of what is going on with a particular child.
Inclusive education is education that includes everyone , including those with special education needs and disabilities, learning together in mainstream schools.
Inclusive education flows from the social model of disability which has been incredibly influential over the last 50 years in shaping the experiences of disabled people.
It emphasises the barriers in society, like buildings or information not being accessible, that disable people who have impairments.
It does not emphasise the impairment itself.
The model says it's society that disables people by not making these environments equally accessible to everyone.
In schools this translates to ensuing that everything - from the curriculum, to resources to the built environment - should be accessible to disabled learners.
Our understanding of disability is rapidly evolving.
For example in recent years it has become much more widely recognised that some people need support with invisible disabilities that cannot be obviously seen.
Equally it is starting to be understood that some so-called âlearning disabilitiesâ can equally be thought of as superpowers.
A teacher who understands this, can truly change lives.
To explore this further see how to support children with special education needs and disability (SEND) .
You might have heard it said that people with ADHD have difficulty focusing on tasks and an inability to control their impulses?
But did you know that given the right task, one that really interests them, people with ADHD can be super focused and highly creative?
Theyâre also often super-resilient because of all the times they have to overcome challenges or steel themselves to focus their mind.
In addition, do you think of dyslexia as being all about problems with reading and writing?
Thatâs not right either.
Itâs an alternate wiring of the brain, one that dials up certain strengths and weaknesses.
It effects how you decode and process information, be this spoken words, written words or even the ideas in your own head.
Alan Sugar, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jamie Oliver are all dyslexic, and all famed for thinking differently.
Dyslexic individuals have certain strengths because they are dyslexic, not despite them being dyslexic.
To find out more check out free training for teachers from Made By Dyslexia on spotting dyslexic strengths and supporting dyslexic children.
What can teachers do to support wellbeing amongst their students?
A good start point is to be familiar with the Five Ways to Wellbeing by the New Economics Foundation.
It outlines five actions we can do in our day-to-day lives that support wellbeing â they are:
Nature is central to our wellbeing.
According to the Mental Health Foundation, research shows that people who are more connected to nature tend to be happier in life, and that nature connectedness is also associated with lower levels of poor mental health, in particular anxiety and depression.
They also report that people with strong nature connectedness are more likely to have pro-environment behaviours, which in turn can have further benefits for the wider society.
Nature truly is the great outdoors.
Teachers can foster a connection to nature, for both their own wellbeing and that of their students, by either taking their teaching outdoors or by bringing nature into the classroom.
So, how might you do that?
The answer lies in the small things.
You donât have to go far to wrap outdoor education into your teaching, donât need to leave the school site.
You don’t even need a forest to teach forest school .
Dr Mark Leather, Associate Professor of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning at Plymouth Marjon University, says: âThe first question of outdoor learning is always why are you here, for what purpose?
Weâre in the woods, or in a green space on the school grounds.
But why?
Often, outdoor activities are perceived as âjust a bit of funâ but for me fun should be taken as standard.
In a fun learning environment, weâre learn stuff without realising it, and a good teacher will draw out that learning.
"The joy of outdoor learning is that we can work on multiple levels.
You can go to the beach to do some science around understanding tides and different zones of the beach, and couple that with learning how connecting with nature helps us to look after ourselves, so do some breathing exercises too.
Always be clear as to the purpose for which your students are out there.â
So how do you start to put these ideas in practice?
Look for the biodiversity around your school site.
Is there a bird box, a log pile (aka bug hotel), a wildflower area or a pond?
Now map those back to curriculum topics, for example you could go outdoors to teach drawing, forces and motion, habitats, looking for shapes and angles, measuring and sampling, poetry, storytelling and use of tools.
Or simply take drama and PE lessons outside.
Resources to expand your outdoor learning practise:
So far, weâve looked at ideas that you could wrap into your teaching practice pretty much tomorrow.
Letâs now look at more structured options for career progressionâ¦
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is the term used to describe learning activities that educators engage in to develop and enhance their abilities throughout their careers.
It is conscious and proactive learning, not passive and reactive learning.
It sees educators take control of their own professional learning and combine this with continuing self-reflection.
CPD spans a great many activities such as further study, training courses, mentoring, shadowing, exploring new pedagogical ideas and more recently digital learning through blogs, podcasts and webinars.
It has been found to increase teacherâs confidence and motivation, and to improve teacher retention.
Plymouth Marjon University offer MA Education (taught in Plymouth and Truro) and MA Professional Education Practice (taught 100% online).
If you're considering doing a Master's degree in Education, at Marjon or anywhere else, then check out the Master’s survival guide with top tips on balancing study, work and wellbeing from Master's of Education students.
Whether youâre just starting out in teaching, or youâre a senior leader, a bit of extra support is always welcome.
Letâs take a look at some emerging ideas that might support your practice.
Positive changes are happening in the realm of teacher development, from the launch of the new Early Career Framework for new teachers to the rise of communities of practice for more experienced educators.
The Early Career Framework is big on mentoring, ongoing professional development, and training.
It has been designed to retain teachers in the profession by providing focused support in the early days.
Mentors in schools will support new teachers, helping them translate the best available evidence around how to teach into their own teaching practice.
By putting mentoring at the heart of things, it also creates new opportunities for experienced teachers to get into mentoring and pass on their knowledge, or even to step up into new specialist teacher mentoring roles.
But what about senior teachers and school leaders, itâs certainly tough at the top so what is out there for you?
If youâve got this far then youâre probably a pro at creating vision and youâre top of the class for reflective thinking.
Youâve likely got strong skills in terms of coaching, community building, data, relationship building, resilience, leadership.
But how can you take this to the next level?
That can be a tricky, but one answer lies in communities of practice.
These are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.
School leadership and  can feel isolating, but there is scope to collaborate with other leaders to bring about better outcomes for all.
Belonging to a community of practice empowers the leader to create enough space to stop the bad stuff and get on with the good.
Other leaders can challenge how you think about things, enabling you to see them in other, potentially better ways.
Thinking differently is often a good thing in leadership, but it can feel risky if you are doing it on your own.
Having other experts to act as sounding boards for your thinking potentially opens the way for new practices to emerge.
The first use of the old saying âtwo minds are better than oneâ can be traced back nearly 500 years, so just imagine what a community of leaders can achieve today!
We started with Robert John Meehan so weâll return to him for the last words: âDon't struggle to be a better teacher than everybody else.
Simply be a better teacher than you ever thought you could be.â
But this is just an intro, we'd love to keep in touch with more opportunities and resources.

What is a degree apprenticeship?
A degree apprenticeship is a job, which combines work with higher-level learning.
Your apprentices can be existing team members or new recruits.
The apprentice works for an employer, they can spend up to 80% of their time in the workplace but must spend at least 20 per cent of their time in study or training with an apprenticeship training provider.
Why should employers offer degree apprenticeships?
Employers may be able to cover or contribute to course fees at no extra costs to their business/organisation via apprenticeship funding .
The Apprenticeship Levy is a UK tax on employers which can be used to fund apprenticeship training.
Employers have options to access apprenticeship funding, even if they are not required to pay the levy.
Levy paying employers
If youâre an employer with a pay bill over Â£3 million each year, you will have been paying the apprenticeship levy from 6 April 2017.
If you are a levy-paying employer, you can now create an account on the apprenticeship service to:
To spend funds in your account, you need to choose a training provider, agree a price and payment schedule and pay for training and assessment with funds through your apprenticeship service account.
Non-Levy paying employers
Non-levy paying employers will share the cost of training and assessing their apprentices with government - this is called âco-investmentâ.
The co-investment rate has changed for new apprenticeships starting on or after 1 April 2019.
You will now pay 5% towards the cost of apprenticeship training.
The government will pay the rest (95%) up to the funding band maximum.
Youâll need to agree a payment schedule with the provider and pay them directly for the training.
The provider must prove that you have paid your contributions as a condition of government paying its contribution.

The 'equal consideration' deadline for UCAS applications is the last Wednesday in January.
There's still time and our top tips will help you turn your last-minute UCAS application into a cracker!
At this stage in the UCAS application process, the personal statement is perhaps the section where you can still make the greatest impact.
Youâve likely got a good idea of your five choices and what your entry requirements are going to look like, but have you properly sold yourself?
Your hobbies academic pursuits only say so much about who you are and what you will bring to your preferred institution.
Now is the time to shout openly about what it is that motivates you to take these huge steps in your career, and why, should it come to it, you deserve a spot on the course of your dreams over another applicant.
If youâre having problems at all with structuring your personal statement, UCAS has provided a very useful template to work through .
If you havenât already, it isnât too late to visit the universities youâre applying to before you make your first choice.
Most institutions offer Campus Tours , Virtual Tours and Open Days for prospective students, so there are plenty of ways to find out more information.
You might also want to chat to a current student through Unibuddy to see how they have enjoyed their university experience.
If your application is strong enough, youâll have a few options when it comes to make your decision, so give yourself the best chance of picking the university thatâs right for you before you make the final call.
You may still be considering several different avenues of study, but if you’re applying for vastly different subjects at vastly different universities, your personal statement, and application as a whole, will likely be less effective.
Remember, you only get to write one personal statement and each university admissions tutor reads it ‘blind’, so being vague and non-committal about what it is that you want will actually weaken your overall application.
Once your application is completed, make sure to re-read it a few times to ensure your work is bulletproof.
Itâs not just the clichÃ©s like spelling errors and grammatical faux-pas , itâs actually about ensuring the tone of your application is an accurate representation of what youâre trying to portray.
Read your work aloud, in full flow, to ensure that you come across as you intended.
Of course, if you have anyone around you during the holiday season to provide constructive feedback, particularly those who have gone through the UCAS process themselves, make sure you ask them to help!
Remember, although the deadline for your UCAS submission is the last Wednesday in January, universities must treat all applications handed in before that deadline equally, so as long as you’ve applied by the deadline you can guarantee that your application will be judged fairly.
In addition, with more people going to university than ever before, there’s a good chance that applications for less competitive courses will be still considered equally, even if they’re submitted after the UCAS deadline - although, of course, we don’t recommend missing the deadline unless it is unavoidable!

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/courses/applying/your-application:
We’ve put together this collection of useful information to support and guide you through the process.
But our main piece of advice is to practice, practice, and then practice some more.
The UCAS process is designed to be flexible so that you can keep going back to perfect your application until you’re 100% happy.
The UCAS electronic form allows you to print off draft copies so you can discuss it with your teachers prior to submission.
You can also ask friends and families to check your application over, offer advice, and suggest subtle changes to enhance your chances.
The UCAS application will also request details about your qualifications, so it’s important to check that these are in line with entry requirements.
If you aren’t sure about the requirements, you can contact our admissions office and they’ll gladly help.
All our codes and course information can be found on the UCAS website, our institution code is P63 (PMARJ) and we don’t have a campus code.
Before we launch into the intricacies, it remains to say: check, check and check again!
Make sure all of your answers are clear as possible, that your reference is present and correct, and there are no typos or errors in your application.
Your referee needs to be someone who can comment on your ability to succeed on the course.
Naturally, the people in the best position to comment are your teachers or tutors.
If you havenât been in education in the last few years, choose someone who can talk professionally about your application and potential, such as an employer or training officer.
You canât choose a family member or friend as your referee.
For undergraduate applications we need an academic reference from your school or college.
For postgraduate applications, weâd expect to see an academic reference if youâve been in education within the last five years.
We consider your predicted and achieved grades at level two and three, or, if youâre a postgraduate, the predicted classification of your degree.
Where appropriate, we like to see an indication of you having extended your studies in appropriate areas.
We pay close attention to the content of your personal statement and we carefully consider your reference.
Hereâs your chance to shine - so make it count!
Youâve got 4000 characters (including spaces) to sell yourself, so organise it cleanly in a word-processing programme such as Microsoft Word.
You can make use of its bold, italic, and underline functions to highlight pertinent points, and then copy and paste into the electronic form when youâve finished.
But again, make sure you proofread carefully by eye, run a spellcheck, confirm the word count, and ask someone to take a final look for you.
To help you shape your personal statement, have a look at your courseâs entry profile to see what admissions tutors are looking for.
And remember: UCAS has sophisticated plagiarism software, so make sure your content is 100% unique.
In terms of content, we like to see the reasons behind your course choice, why you think your qualifications stand you in good stead for the course, and evidence of motivation to learn at a higher level.
We also want to know about any relevant work experience, what your career goals are, details of any accreditations or achievements you have under your belt, and any plans you have for a gap year (if relevant).
Talk about your extracurricular activities, hobbies and interests.
We want to know what makes you tick, and which skills youâve picked up along the way.
When you receive an offer from the University, itâll be either conditional (C) or unconditional (U).
If itâs unconditional, itâs a done deal in terms of entry requirements.
However, the offer may specify certain extras like DBS checks, or financial and medical conditions.
If your offer is conditional, itâs likely that youâll need to achieve certain grades or qualifications or provide proof of existing qualifications.
You may be asked to complete specific grades to boost your UCAS points.
When it comes to replying to our offer, you can either offer a firm acceptance (F) which commits you to the course, an insurance choice (I) which makes us your backup choice, or you can decline (D) to let us know you no longer require this choice.
Once your results are through and everything is ticked off, weâll confirm your place with UCAS and theyâll send you an official confirmation letter.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/courses/international/international-student-visas/tuition-fees-for-international-students:
All applicants to Plymouth Marjon University must have their fees status determined as either Home or Overseas.
UK Government Legislation allows publicly funded institutions to charge fees to non-UK students at a higher rate than to UK students unless they fulfil certain residence and immigration status criteria.
If you are a non-UK national, reside outside the UK, entered the UK after your date of birth or claim residency status in the UK, we will contact you for more information.
This may be to ask for a copy of your passport or to see your residency evidence ie Indefinite Leave to Remain, or for the code to access your Settled or Pre-settled status.
We may also ask you to complete an assessment questionnaire.
For more information on tuition fees and funding please go to Marjon information page and for information on eligibility to pay Home tuition fees please look at UKCISA guidance .
We are not able to make a decision on your fee status before an application but if you have queries about your fee status once you have applied, please email feeassessment@marjon.ac.uk .
The personal information you provide when completing this form will be used by the University solely to determine whether you are classified as a Home or Overseas student for the purpose of University tuition fees and will be processed in accordance with the Plymouth Marjon Universityâs Data Protection policy.
For more information visit our data privacy page Fees and funding for EU students The UK Government has confirmed that EU students commencing their studies in the UK from academic year 2021/22 onwards will no longer automatically be eligible for Home tuition fee status unless they have Settled or Pre-settled status.
EU applicants will need to complete a fee status questionnaire to determine whether they are liable for Home or Overseas fees.
EU students currently on a course that started in 2020/21 or earlier will continue to pay the same fees as home students for the duration of your course.
What happens if I am not eligible for Home tuition fees?
If you have been assessed as having to pay Overseas tuition fees, you will be required to pay for the full year before you start.
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer non-UK students an instalment plan.
We will send you more information on how to pay the University.
If you are assessed as needing a Student Visa to study in the UK, please see our further information and guidance.
For each subsequent year of study, the tuition fees must be paid in full for that year, before registration.
We are unable to provide payment instalments for overseas fee payers.
What to do if you feel that your fee status has been wrongly assessed If you feel that you have been incorrectly assessed, you should contact feeassessment@marjon.ac.uk as quickly as possible.
A student's fee status is determined by the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations.
The regulations are not set by the University and the University has no authority to over-ride them.
The regulations we use apply to higher education institutes in England.
Different regulations apply to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to colleges of further education and programmes attracting an NHS bursary.
Fee status after your course has started It is not usually possible for a student's fee status to change once their course has started, except in exceptional circumstances.
These circumstances include if the student became a UK national or the relevant family member of an UK national, or if a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and the student can evidence they meet the residency requirement (time spent for study purposes in the UK does not count towards the five-year residency requirement).
Any requests for reassessment of fees should be made in writing to feeassessment@marjon.ac.uk .
Changes in fee status are not automatic and any amendments to fee status following re-assessment will come into effect at the start of the following academic year only and cannot be applied retrospectively except in the case where an error has been made in the original fee assessment.

How to get into teaching
Your teacher training personal statement should express why you'd make a great teacher and spell out your experiences, qualities and skills.
We've got the inside track from Admissions Tutors on how to go about writing a good teacher training personal statement, what to do and what not to overlook...
6 minute read
Let's start with a look at when to apply for teacher training.
Places on teacher training courses are filled on a first come first serve basis.
This is due to two factors.
Firstly, the Department for Education set the maximum number of trainees on some courses.
But the thing that really limits the number of places available is ensuring that there are enough school placements for all trainees.
Training providers can only recruit up to a number that is manageable in terms of providing the trainees with the placement experiences they need.
Places for the most popular subjects tend to go early, for example, Physical Education (PE), Primary and Psychology.
Shortage subjects such as Chemistry, Computing, Maths and Physics donât fill up so fast.
The route you are taking into teaching may also influence when you apply.
School Direct is run by the schools themselves and they can only take as many trainees as they can train within their schools.
They may only have the one place available for your chosen subject and once those placements are gone, theyâre gone.
Universities tend to have larger and wider networks of partner schools which provide school placements.
This gives them more options for finding school placements so they may have places available for longer.
Unlike School Direct you donât get to choose exactly which school you go to, though theyâll try to match your school placements to your preferences as much as possible.
If you apply late you run the risk that all the placements are gone.
So, you want to apply as soon as you can, with a brilliant personal statement that reflects who you are and why you want to become a teacher.
So, what does that look like?
Your teacher training personal statement broadly needs to convey four things:
Kate Brimacombe, Associate Professor of Education and Associate Director of the Teacher Education Partnership at Plymouth Marjon University, explains what she is looking for in a teacher training personal statement:
âIt canât feel half-hearted, it needs to feel committed.
If independence, motivation, and self-reliance donât sing off the page, then that's an error in a sense.
You need to get your personality into the written word, Iâm looking for that fire that says âthis is absolutely what I want to doâ.
One common mistake is being too short so that it doesnât get that passion across.
The lack of content and desire are the main reasons I don't shortlist candidates.â
You must convey why you want to teach your subject.
What is your expertise?
Why do you love it?
What are the challenges facing teachers of your subject?
Why do you want to teach this?
Think about the age group youâll be teaching and discuss why you want to teach them.
What relevant experience do you have?
How does your experience to date influence your thinking?
Ultimately, youâve got to inspire others to love your subject, so be clear about how your own relationship to it is going to enable this.
The ingredients of a convincing teacher training personal statement are:
In addition, for a strong personal statement youâll want to demonstrate some awareness of the national curriculum for your subject and then highlight how your subject knowledge maps to it.
Back to Kate for another crucial tip: âThe other big thing is that weâre checking the accuracy of your spelling and grammar, it must be correct if youâre going to be a teacher.
To be fair, we don't get a lot of mistakes because I think people understand that expectations around written and verbal communication are high in teaching.â
Some aspiring teachers know they want to teach but are uncertain on the age group or subject.
For example, maybe you love sport and are keen to be a secondary PE teacher, but you also enjoy working with younger children at sports clubs so youâre feeling split.
In this scenario, try to settle this before you apply but if you canât then write honestly about the situation and take extra care to ensure that neither option comes across being the fallback one that youâre not really committed to.
There's no one way to structure your teacher training personal statement but be sure to back up every point you make with evidence.
A great way to do this is give real life examples of what you actually did, and what you learned from it.
Itâs not enough to just list your work experience, you need to explain what you learned and how this experience will help you as a teacher.
You donât need school experience to apply for a teaching course, though it helps.
But if you donât have school experience then you at least need some transferable skills, so any other experience of working with children is valid here, things like helping with sports teams and youth clubs are valid too.
Use your examples to demonstrate the skills youâd bring to the role of teacher.
You could also refer to a teacher who made a difference to you at school, or who influenced your love of working with children and helping them to learn.
By discussing examples, you can also demonstrate that you are realistic about the role, in that is challenging as well as rewarding.
For example, you might discuss a session you observed or taught, reflecting on what went well, how you adapted to the situation and how you would improve on it.
This is how to make effective use of real life examples, according to Julie Stevens, course leader for PGCE Secondary Education at Plymouth Marjon University: âI want to read about how youâve helped a pupil to make progress.
What did you change?
How did you recognise they werenât learning?
What did you adapt to help them understand?
Maybe you modelled it or talked it through?
How did the child respond?
You might talk for example about why a child was messing around or why a seating chart was put together in a certain way.
Itâs really encouraging when a candidate offers insights into teaching and that sense of self-reflectionâ.
You can talk about that examples that demonstrate transferable skills.
For example, maybe you had to be resilient to get your Duke of Edinburgh award, maybe youâre a leader on the sports field or maybe youâre a dedicated musician with the music exams to prove it?
In addition, the way you talk about children is really important, the training provider needs to know that you see them as individuals and that you want to help them become independent thinkers.
Back to Julie again for more about this: âI want to see candidates who talk about children as individuals and how you can help them make the best progress they can.
Helping young people to make decisions for themselves and become independent learners, so that they take responsibility for their own success is essential for adulthood.
"Itâs great when someone can talk about innovative things, like how to use social media for good outcomes.
Anything like that is powerful because it means they understand our role as educators â we arenât just filling them with knowledge, we're trying to get children and young people to understand how to develop themselves.â
References really do matter.
Julie and Kate report that in practice most of barriers to shortlisting a candidate come not from the personal statement, but from references that are too short.
Theyâve seen references as short as three lines and that doesnât tell them enough about you and your suitability for a career in teaching.
You could be an impressive candidate, but you canât be offered a place until your reference checks out.
If youâre applying for undergraduate teacher training through UCAS then one reference is required.
If youâre applying for postgraduate teacher training then youâll need two references.
If youâre at university, or have been within the past five years, then one reference must be from someone at your university.
The other reference can be from someone who knows you from work, and if youâre applying for School Direct then one of your references must come from your current employer.
A good reference says good things about you and backs up some of qualities and skills youâve outlined in your personal statement.
Your referee needs to talk about your character and why they think you could be a great teacher.
The training provider is looking for insight; a different perspective on you, and hopefully one that that verifies the impressions theyâre taking from your statement.
You can do a lot to make sure your reference is on point.
Ideally they would read your personal statement so that they can write a reference that complements it.
If applicable, ask your referee to comment on your academic abilities, including your predicted grades.
If possible, go through the reference with your referee as you might see something theyâve missed.
If so, ask if they are willing to add it, itâs up to them but you can suggest things.
Back to Kate for closing advice: âSpeak with honesty and speak from the heart.
Iâm looking for passion.
I'm looking for somebody I think the has the potential.
Then when you come to interview, I already know that you have that passion and so you just need to add the shine to that and tell us more about it in-person, one to one.
In that way your teacher training personal statement is the stepping stone into the interview, if it does its job then weâll be excited to find out more about youâ.
Youâve got this.
Follow the advice above and youâll have a brilliant teacher training personal statement in the bag.
The next step will be your teacher training interview, so why not check out our articles on how to ace your teacher training interview and teacher training interview questions .

Professional development for teachers
Mentoring is the glue that holds together the professional development of teachers and school leaders.
It builds teachers’ confidence; done well it even keeps them in the profession.
5 minute read
It comes as no surprise then that mentoring plays a central role in the Early Career Framework (ECF) which underpins the professional development of new teachers joining the profession.
Happily the framework also offers many more opportunities for experienced teachers to become mentors to new teachers.
At the heart of effective mentoring is a powerful, yet underused word, connection .
The role of a mentor extends beyond instructing.
It is more than telling someone what they should do, or how to plan for a lesson.
Effective mentoring creates the environment and facilitates the space for mentees to grow and develop their personal and professional goals.
The best mentoring creates a permanent connection between the mentee and teaching, by building professional confidence and expertise.
Put simply, mentoring is when an experienced professional (the mentor) assists a less experienced professional (the mentee) in developing specific skills and knowledge.
To help explain what mentoring is, letâs mention a few things that mentoring is not.
It is not line managing, telling a colleague what to do, counselling and it is not personal.
The relationship between mentor and mentee is not personal because there is a clear power imbalance between the two.
Mentoring is a professional partnership between two people â it is ârelationalâ (coaching is functional).
It is usually a long-term relationship that needs to be based on mutual trust and respect.
An effective mentoring relationship can only be achieved if the mentor is listening to the needs of the mentee, developing existing knowledge, introducing them to new skills and connecting them to the wider community of professionals.
With a third of teachers leaving the profession within the first five years, it is important that early career teachers feel they are supported and connected to the culture and wider network of the school.
Being isolated in your classroom, unclear of the direction of your career and how to progress needs to come to an end, and this starts with effective mentors.
Weâre about to delve into the details of how to run effective mentoring, but letâs start with a quick checklist of behaviours essential to effective mentoring in schools:
Sounds great huh?
So how do you make this work in practice?
The process of change for the mentees begins with conversations.
Here are three ways to get those conversations flowingâ¦
Ask open questions such as âtell me about your relationship with your colleagues?â.
Avoid leading questions such as âdo you have a problem with your colleagues?â.
Leading questions subtly prompt a response in the person and may influence the way they answer it.
Active listening when others are talking - often, our minds are racing onto different topics or planning what we are going to say in response.
When we are waiting to speak, we are not fully listening to what the other person is saying.
This means we can miss important information.
When your mentee is talking try to:
Constructive feedback - the key is to offer solutions instead of simply pointing out the negatives in a personâs behaviour.
Some tips:
Effective mentoring focuses on supporting change and transitions for the mentee.
The process of change starts with conversations.
The mentor is there to advise and guide the mentee about what goals to set and how they can go about achieving them.
The mentor is there to support the mentee in their professional development.
They are not there to judge where the mentee is at in their career, it follows that the goals should be driven by the mentee and not based on the mentors view of things.
Once a goal is established the mentor can actively help the mentee to get there in three waysâ¦
Be supportive - Itâs important to create opportunities for mentees in their professional learning.
Promoting an open culture whereby they can observe the teaching styles of more experienced members of staff will help them to feel connected and they will pick up tricks of the trade.
Establishing a âsafe placeâ in which the mentee can fail and to thrive is essential.
For example, if they are doing something that they feel is particularly ineffective, itâs important that they have the confidence to talk to you about it.
Be enabling - Set your mentees expectations about what teaching really is.
Donât hide aspects of it from them.
They will then have the confidence to be able to deal with issues as they arise.
Open doors for your mentee, encourage them to speak to people within your wider networks, such as professional colleagues who understand and can support them with an area of their professional development.
Empower them â At the outset of the mentoring relationship, the mentee is typically quite dependent on the mentor for advice and problem-solving.
The mentee then grows increasingly independent, enabled by feedback and self-reflection on their own actions.
By the end of the mentoring relationship, there is a two-way discussion, with the mentor acting simply as a sounding board as the mentee has grown enough to do a lot of their own problem-solving.
The mentee learns to make good decisions.
Youâre working together, mentor and mentee, to create a relationship where the mentee develops the confidence to find the answers in themselves to the questions that are arising in their teaching practice.
Within your first session you need to set expectations.
The mentor must establish the content, timeframe, and the method of mentoring and agree this with the mentee.
Get to know your mentee as an individual.
What are their values?
Why did they choose to teach?
What values do you share?
Remember to ask your mentee what they want from you.
It might sound simple, but itâs essential to take the time to ask about what your mentee wants to learn from your expertise.
They might surprise you!
You donât need to rush the mentoring process.
As the mentor youâre the expert, and undoubtedly there will be lots of knowledge and skills for you to pass on.
The mentoring sessions will go a lot smoother if you set up a clear plan to structure your mentees professional development and learning, so they can become a better teacher.
To fail to plan is to plan to fail and all that.
Mentoring is not line managing and you are not there to judge your mentee.
âJudgementoringâ is a big âno noâ and will destroy trust and stop professional development.
Learning the skill of teaching is not a linear process.
It helps to think of it as a cycle - Do, Review, Conclude, Adapt and Plan .
It helps to use the Early Career Framework (ECF) as a stepping stone for different stages of the teaching journey; look at the ECF syllabus together and agree where you're going to start.
At the end of each mentoring session, mentor and mentee need to leave with clear actionable goals to put into practice before the next session.
Keep goals simple and realistic.
Some example goals for early career teachers would be:
Adapt one teaching approach you have tried to include something different that has been evidenced to improve the way students learn.
Review its success.
Observe an experienced teacher in your subject area or phase (be ready to share your observations with your mentor at the next session).
Use open questions more in lessons.
4 .Check that you are considering all studentsâ progress (not just those that are vocal or more engaged).
The virtuous circle of mentoring sets out some great principles to remember as you shape your mentoring sessions.
It sees the mentor and mentee establish shared values, develop opportunities for reciprocity, grow respect, set expectations, and build connections.
Developing an effective mentoring practice is essential if you are going to impact positively on your mentees.
Answering these questions will put you in a good position to develop not only effective sessions with your mentees, but a good mentoring practice:
Keep coming back to these questions and use them to help you evaluate how you as a mentor are progressing week-by-week.
Like any practice, it gets easier with time but, needs consistent attention to feel like you are having noticeable effects.
So, what are the signs of successful mentoring?
Well as the mentee grows, youâll notice their increasing their confidence and see them develop wider networks of influence as they get to know more members of the school community.
Youâll also see increasing self-awareness in the mentee (and few signs of the isolation they may have experienced as they navigate the early days of a teaching career).
Itâs not often we get to see the positive effects we have on people and mentoring is a fantastic way to help others flourish whilst developing a worthwhile skill and sense of purpose.
If you have the chance to mentor then go for it; give it your best and youâll feel a sense of satisfaction rarely experienced in the workplace.

Some Postgraduate Graduate Certificate of Educations (PGCE) are designed to prepare for placements in school through intensive campus-based training.
Others permit trainees to spend more time in setting, learning the same curriculum, but through a flexible blend of learning opportunities.
Let’s look at the two types of PGCE experience; explore the differences between them and hear first-hand from teachers what they are like.
If you already have a degree, you can choose between a number of routes into teaching.
One of the main routes is a PGCE.
Most PGCEs are one-year courses that see you train for a minimum of 24 weeks working in schools – this is split across two schools, working towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
QTS is the professional qualification for teachers.
It is required to teach in state-run primary, secondary and special schools.
The entry requirements for PGCEs are mostly the same across providers, they require you to have at least a GCSE grade C in Maths and English, and in Science for primary, and – for most institutions - a 2.2 or above in any undergraduate degree.
However, PGCEs can vary between provider and even within a provider's training offer.
A Campus-based PGCE is university-led, with training located in both school and university.
The university, not the school, oversees the curriculum for the trainees.
Trainees go on teaching placement within schools for around two-thirds of the year.
During this time, you are in school from Monday to Friday, nine to five.
The other third of your time is spent in university developing the knowledge to teach successfully, developing an understanding of topics such as inclusion, behaviour management, planning, assessment, approaches to learning and teaching and current issues in education.
Trainees also cover the broad subject knowledge needed to teach their specialism, typically learning in mock classroom environments that are set up with all the equipment found in a regular classroom.
Campus-based PGCE combines an academic focus and school placements with getting to experience wider university life.
A School Based PGCE enables you to undertake more of your training in school.
You will learn the same curriculum as campus-based trainees, but flexibly through a blend of University days; learning on the job and learning from specialist school staff.
Whilst the campus based course also contains these elements, on the school-based course more of the learning is completed in your setting and with our school partners.
The school based route may be suited to you if your are confident in your ability to take responsibility for your learning; able to throw yourself into the life of a school and to seek out the information you need to develop yourself.
Trainees on this route, typically, benefit from being in school in the very first week of the year.
Bursaries and student finance are open to trainees on both the campus based and school based PGCE routes.
You can apply for student finance to cover your tuition fees and cost of living, and potentially for teacher training bursary too (if one is available for your subject).
In many ways, your teacher training experience will be similar with a school based or campus based PGCE.
Both combine substantive in-school-training supported by intensive study of how to teach.
At first glance it’s tricky to tell what the differences are so we asked Giles Freathy, school-based PGCE programme leader at Plymouth Marjon University, to explain: ”a school based PGCE is best suited to trainees who can work on their own initiative.
It is great for independent self-starters who already have some work experience in education and schools, people who already know enough to hit the ground running.
Campus based PGCE trainees tend to come straight from university, or they might have had a year out, but they receive more structure and more University based subject knowledge development.”
"I'm a tutor for our Lead Partners, who recruit to and work with us to offer our school based courses.
We often interview together to work out what is going to work best for the candidate.
If I think they haven't got much experience then we recommend that they compete the campus-based PGCE.
If they're flying already, they know a lot about teaching and learning and have school experience, then they may be more suited to a school based course.
They will still get support from the university but will have the chance to go into a school earlier and for longer”.
School based courses can be a good option for trainees who would like to work in their placement school once they are qualified.
While this is not guaranteed, schools will often take trainees on in subjects where they know they have a shortage or they anticipate that someone is leaving, so there is sometimes a chance of a job at the end.
Likewise with a school based course you’re part of the school team as you’re there most of the time, so you’re that bit more integrated and well positioned to find out about job openings.
When choosing between a campus based and school based PGCE ask the various training providers and their Lead Partner schools/organisations about whether subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) courses are available, and any associated costs.
SKE courses can either be used to update your knowledge of your core subject or to add a second string to your bow.
Back to Giles to explain how SKE courses can make trainees more employable: “Subject knowledge enhancement is all about employability.
When my trainees are secure in the core subject they want to teach, they might then think about doing another subject.
Take PE teachers for example, there are many PE teachers, all competing for the same jobs.
If a PE teacher can also offer a shortage subject like maths, science, or languages, and they have some experience of teaching it in school, they’ll have more to offer the school than just the one subject.
It makes them way more employable."
Teaching placements are fundamental to both Campus-based and School-based PGCEs.
They are carefully structured to gradually take you from trainee to teacher as the year progresses.
This is how it works:
Daisy Briggs is an Art and Design teacher who completed a PGCE at Plymouth Marjon University.
We asked her why she picked a campus based PGCE over a school based PGCE, and how it turned out.
Over to Daisy...
"I picked campus-based PGCE because I liked the fact that placements were separated by university study time.
This meant that there was plenty of time for reflection in between placements which I think helped me to understand my areas for development going into the second placement.
It also helped me with my nerves in relation to going into schools, especially as someone starting teacher training with no prior school experience.
"Going into uni before the first placement helped me to prepare for school life and clearly understand the expectations for me as a trainee once I was on placement.
"The campus-based PGCE is great because you get to know others on the course and can benefit from sharing experiences and feel you have a diverse network of support from other students and lecturers.
"The only drawback I can think of is with placements, you only get a relatively short time in school and so you don't get a complete picture of school life and the whole school year.
It's also slightly more challenging as you aren't introduced to students in September, when they are used to meeting new teachers and this can make it harder to set expectations and build relationships."
Michael Johnson is a primary teacher who trained on a school-based course with Plymouth Marjon University and one of our Lead Partners.
We asked him why he picked a school based PGCE over a campus based one, and how it turned out.
Let's find out...
“I chose a School-based PGCE because I was used to being in school.
Also, as you go to your placement school as early as day one, everyone treats you as a member of staff.
"There were clear set times for placement then other times focused on university work and subject knowledge.
Another positive thing with School Direct was that my placements were not far from where I live, meaning my commute was never more than 30 to 40 mins.
“There are only a couple of drawbacks to the school-based course relative to the campus-based PGCE, such as not receiving as much support and contact time with university and tutors, which for me was further impacted by training during Covid-19.
Plus in the first term it felt that PGCE students had more time to focus on their assignments whilst we were planning and delivering lessons as well as studying.”
You can rest assured that employers do not look more favourably on any one course over the others, as they all lead to the same qualification.
However, they may ask you why you chose the training course you did so it’s helpful to do your research so you can speak clearly if this ever does come up.

Who said being a teacher was easy?
The new Early Career Framework (ECF) is changing the teaching landscape, with mentoring and focused support for new teachers.
Now the teaching profession is getting the attention it deserves.
The Early Career Framework (ECF) is a new two-year support package for new teachers.
When you earn Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), you are now classed as an Early Career Teacher (ECT).
In the first two years of your teaching career, you will be required to continue professional development with the support of a mentor within the school that employs you.
If you have obtained Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and work in a maintained school or academy then you are required to work within the Early Career Framework for the first two years of your employment.
If you work part-time, or go on maternity leave, you’ll work within the Early Career Framework for an extended time, until you have worked the equivalent of two years.
The Early Career Framework applies to primary and secondary teachers in maintained schools.
It does not align with Independent schools, Early Years or Further Education.
The Early Career Framework replaces Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) status.
That was a one-year programme, it had no core content but came with the added pressure in that teachers had to ‘pass’.
The Early Career Framework was announced as part of the government’s Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy in 2019 and came into force from September 2021.
Early career teachers will continue to be assessed against the Teachers’ Standards.
Over the two years, a teacher will have professional development linked to these five areas, delivered by a combination of mentoring, school based training and external courses:
It is possible for these five areas to overlap.
For example, you may be learning about how to design a subject-specific curriculum, whilst also outlining how youâre going to assess it.
Or you might be looking at one of these five areas individually.
For example, behaviour management will give you the chance to learn about safeguarding, the prevent agenda and supporting transgender pupils.
Depending on where your school is located, you will face different challenges.
For example, rural schools may face different issues and therefore require different training compared to schools in central London.
Your Early Career Framework package is designed to blend core training whilst being flexible and able to respond to local challenges.
In England, as in other countries, there are concerns about the shortage of teachers in schools.
These concerns are justified.
Recent data shows that the overall number of teachers has not kept pace with increasing pupil numbers, with around 42,000 full-time equivalent qualified teachers leaving the state-funded sector in the 12 months to November 2018, an attrition of 9.8 per cent.
15% of teachers will leave the profession within the first two years of employment, with a third leaving within five years.
Reasons given are a lack of support and training coupled with a sudden rise in responsibility and workload as they transition into their new careers.
New teachers may experience âreality shockâ due to unexpected personal and professional demands, and the unpredictability and complexity of their role.
This may impact their confidence to do their role.
With more training opportunities and better support, the Early Career Framework hopes to empower teachers to do the job they trained for and develop their careers further.
Cat Scutt MBE, Director of Education and Research at the Chartered College of Teaching , offers this perspective on the Early Career Framework:
"Early career teachers are only just beginning their journey in the teaching profession - the most rewarding profession there is.
Research shows that teachersâ effectiveness increases rapidly in their first few years in the classroom (Kraft and Papay, 2014), and whilst new teachers will have learnt a huge amount during initial teacher education, there is not enough time in the relatively short period of an ITE programme to learn everything there is to know and develop all the skills necessary as a teacher.
"The Chartered College of Teaching, as the professional body for the teaching profession, has therefore been supportive from the start about the principle of the Early Career Framework, which sets out a programme of support and development for new teachers that covers the two years after they complete initial teacher training.
I was privileged to be a member of the group of experts convened by the DfE to advise on its development.
"We believe that an entitlement to development for new teachers across two years, as well as strengthened expectations of mentoring, supports not just the development of Early Career Teachers themselves but also provides opportunities for development and progression of more experienced teachers who may act as mentors.
High-quality training, delivered by national delivery providers or developed in-house, should again support both new teachers and their mentors, contributing to a culture of professional learning at a system level.
"However, it will only be successful if schools are able to really take advantage of the time, resources and funding available to support it; we recognise that its roll-out comes at a particularly challenging time.
We have produced a number of resources ourselves to support the implementation of the Early Career Framework, including a handbook for Early Career Teachers and their mentors - The Early Career Framework Handbook - published through Sage; an annual online webinar series, the Early Career Festival; and the Early Career Hub , an area of our member website designed exclusively for early career teachers, with resources aligned to the Early Career Framework, including self-review activities, case studies, videos of classroom practice and subject-specific examples.
"We will be continuing to develop our offer in the coming months, and would love to hear from new teachers, schools and training providers of anything we can do to help!"
In their first year of teaching, early career teachers will have 10% remission to engage in professional development; this is on top of the 10% remission all teachers have for preparation, planning and marking time.
In the second year of teaching, early career teachers get 5% remission to engage in professional development activities, as well as the 10% remission of all teachers.
This allows you to develop strategies to develop sustainable working practices as you progress through your career; gradually building up capacity and teaching time.
The mentors will be specifically selected by the school.
Early Career Teachers will work with a named mentor and meet on a regular basis to discuss:
Mentors will already be a teacher working within the school.
They will be experienced teachers who continue to teach classes, but also have time allocated to mentoring alongside their teaching timetable.
There is funding allocated by the Department of Education for this role, though it is up to each school to decide how to use it.
Crucially, mentors will also receive support and training in mentoring.
You may wish to see our article on effective mentoring for teachers .
Schools will be supported in delivering the Early Career Framework by regional teaching school hubs .
These are a network of 87 centres of excellence for teacher training, development, and leadership.
The key functions are:
The teaching school hub program is part of the governmentâs Recruitment and Retention Strategy and seeks to improve the quality and effectiveness of teachers through all stages of their careers.
The Early Career Framework syllabus will primarily be delivered by six lead providers.
Each provider offers a slightly different type of experience for the Early Career Teacher and will have been chosen for synergies with local contexts.
The provider will connect to regional Teaching School Hubs, which in turn will liaise with local delivery partners such as multi-academy trusts and teaching school alliances.
There are also options for schools and multi-academy trusts to provide their Early Career Teachers with an Early Career Framework programme developed fully in house, or one that uses resources developed by other providers.
"The Early Career Framework is a really promising initiative.
It puts new teachers in touch with one another, creating support networks so they donât feel alone in the classroom.
The challenge will be the scale itâs got to work at, with up to 3000 schools being supported by a single regional teaching hub.
There will be lots to learn as they go along but I think weâll see increasing confidence in how to access the framework, and online launch events happening are already helping.
"It encourages greater collaboration within the sector, enabling schools to access expert help to deliver key content for their early career teachers.
It will also bring more opportunities to think, and collaborate, locally about what is needed.
Itâs a positive move for the teaching profession."
Professor Gill Golder, Director of Marjon Teacher Education Partnership at Plymouth Marjon University
The Early Career Framework is informed by earlier research, including RETAIN, an early career teacher retention programme developed and delivered for the Educational Endowment Foundation by Professor Tanya Ovenden Hope, Provost at Marjon University Cornwall .
RETAIN sought to mitigate Early Career Teacher attrition in schools with high levels of persistently disadvantaged pupils.
RETAIN consisted of three evidence based modules.
These were understanding and mitigating against the impact of socio-economic disadvantage on schools and pupils; pedagogy, skills and practice; and career pathways for teachers.
All were fully resourced through an online platform and two full day workshops per module.
Mentors, known as school champions, were supported with two half day workshops.
Early Career Teachers received regular one to one coaching in school so that they could apply what they had learned on the programme to their practice.
They were also supported in applying current and robust educational research evidence to their practice.
RETAIN also embedded a requirement for extensive peerâschool collaboration to establish a Professional Learning Community between the Early Career Teachers and within their schools.
This was achieved through collaborative peer learning, peer observation, mentors, social media and a hub of online resources.
The outcome was that participating teachers saw an increase in their knowledge and understanding of strategies for teaching, and reported changes in their classroom practice.
Their self-efficacy, confidence and research-use also increased.
All Early Career Teachers on the RETAIN programme remained in teaching after four years, by which time the majority were in a leadership role.
"The RETAIN programme was highly effective.
It developed the Early Career Teachers confidence in their ability to teach in the most challenging of situations.
By extending their opportunities to engage with best practice evidence, attend workshops that modelled this practice and then try it out on their school with the support of both a mentor and coach, RETAIN provided a professional development and learning experience that worked.
The âhowâ of the RETAIN model is important as the âwhatâ.
I am delighted to see mentoring at the heart of the Early Career Framework, as effective mentoring is fundamental in developing and retaining teachers ."
Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope, Provost at Marjon University Cornwall
Itâs a great idea to have an open and honest conversation about the Early Career Framework with your new school.
Ask about what their plans are to deliver the framework?
Be aware of what youâre most confident about and the things youâll be wanting more support with to help shape what happens next.
You can use our teaching strengths template to help you get started.
If you are employing Early Career Teachers, be aware of the funding and support for them and for their mentors.
There are three options for accessing resources and funding:
Next steps for school leaders choosing option one:
With the introduction of the Early Career Framework, teachers joining the profession will have a strong start that values them as skilled professionals.
With a community of coaches and mentors, schools can start to open conversations that promote collaboration and welcome in the new generation of inspired teachers.

Being a teaching assistant is challenging, but the upsides are variety, family-friendly hours and enabling those eureka moments, when a child suddenly gets it.
Here is the lowdown on how to get a job as a teaching assistant.
There is no set path to becoming a teaching assistant.
How teaching assistants are recruited and exactly how they are deployed in the classroom is very much down to individual employers, and these might be nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges or special schools.
So, let's start by taking a look at how to find teaching assistant jobs...
Many teaching assistant roles are not widely advertised, as they are easily filled from within the school community.
This means that one of the answers to how to get a job as a teaching assistant is to start out by volunteering at the school.
You can then make teachers and school leaders aware that youâre interested in becoming a teaching assistant, and then theyâve got you in mind if any opportunities come up.
Equally, many teaching assistants start out in support roles such as after-school club helper or meal-time assistant, and slide into the teaching assistant role when the school quickly needs someone to step in.
Lots of teaching assistant jobs are advertised online, try googling âteacher assistant jobsâ to find openings local to you, and check the websites of local councils and local schools.
Or just give them a call to see if anything is available.
Be ready to provide a CV that points to the qualities and skills that youâd bring to the teaching assistant role, such as empathy, good interpersonal skills, good organisation skills, creativity, patience, and a love of working with children.
Highlight your relevant experience, this could be from a job, or volunteering with any child or youth orientated organisation, or what youâve learnt from your own children.
Check the grammar and spelling in the CV are spot on, as schools are super-hot on literacy.
You donât need qualifications to become a teaching assistant.
This said many schools will require anyone wanting to be a teaching assistant to do literacy and maths tests, or at least will check on your GCSE English and Maths grades.
An enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check, which is a check for criminal convictions, is essential for this role.
It is a big plus to have a relevant qualification, such as a level 2 or 3 NVQ in an education related subject.
Many teaching assistants opt to do a qualification to enrich their understanding of child development and ways of learning.
They choose part-time courses, such as FdA Learning and Teaching , which can be studied alongside working as a teaching assistant.
If you donât have relevant qualifications then there are short courses you can do to boost your employability as a teaching assistant, for example courses in child first aid and safeguarding, which can usually be found for free either locally or online.
To get a teaching assistant role youâll need to demonstrate your passion for working with children, for example by talking about your motivations for wanting to help children to develop and by providing relevant examples from your experience to date.
Youâll typically be interviewed for a teaching assistant role by the Headteacher plus one or two others, usually a Governor, Lead Teaching Assistant or Teacher.
Here are some questions which are likely to be asked at teaching assistant interviews.
Read them, make notes, and practice saying your answers out loud, so they flow on the day.
Seven interview questions for teaching assistant jobs:
To help you answer these questions we’re about to take a closer look at the role of the teaching assistant, but first we’ll cover a few more things to get you ready for the interview.
You'll likely be asked scenario-based questions that explore how you would react in situations that arise in the classroom, for example:
If you are asked to give an example of how you managed a situation in your past experience, you can use the Situation, Action, Result (SAR) technique to help you form coherent and comprehensive answers to scenario-based questions.
It works like this:
You may also be asked to lead an activity with some children.
If youâre asked to prepare an activity, then check the age group so you can be sure that itâs age appropriate.
Itâs a great idea to ask what topics the children are already working on and align the activity to that.
Marie Bradwell, a former Teaching Assistant, and now Education Lecturer and Researcher at Plymouth Marjon University adds: âThe other thing to do is to read through the curriculum, which not everybody enjoys doing, but you might get asked about it.
Not everyone is confident in English and Maths up to Key Stage 2, so having that understanding increases your chances of getting a teaching assistant job.â
Remember, whatever happens, to stay calm and focused.
The reality of this role is that youâll be juggling priorities, and thatâs before the teacher throws you an urgent task or a child becomes disruptive in the classroom.
Youâve got to demonstrate at interview that you can keep your cool because a teaching assistant needs to be ready for pretty much anything!
A teaching assistant is there to support pupils in their educational development, and equally with their emotional and social needs.
They encourage and motivate pupils and provide extra support where needed.
They also provide crucial support to the teacher, freeing them to focus on other tasks by taking on things like preparing activities, photocopying, marking, and stepping in when a child becomes disruptive so that the teacher can continue to teach.
There are two main types of teaching assistant roles.
The first is being a general support to the teacher, doing tasks that free up their time for teaching, such as setting up resources and giving extra support to those children in the class who need it most.
The second type of teaching assistant is tasked to work exclusively to support a pupil, or a group of pupils, who have Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans.
These plans outline the support required for children who have specific needs, such as special educational needs or mental health conditions.
In practice the two types of teaching assistant roles arenât so distinct.
Schools have children with undiagnosed needs and general teaching assistants will be there to support them, at least until the child is assessed and specialist support is put in place.
There are two sides to teaching assistant roles â academic and pastoral.
On the academic side, youâre there to support the children to learn, for example supporting computer skills, spelling, and phonics (and you can learn your phonics on YouTube).
When the teacher leaves the classroom, the teaching assistant is effectively in charge of the class, which takes confidence.
A more experienced teaching assistant will sometimes be asked to take the class, usually theyâll be implementing a teacherâs lesson plan but sometimes theyâll plan their own sessions too.
The teacher leads on behaviour management and the teaching assistant takes their lead, escalating behaviour issues to the teacher when required.
Invariably the teaching assistant will sometimes have to deal with challenging behaviour.
For example, a child may have to be removed from the class and the teaching assistant may be alone with that child until they have calmed down.
The teaching assistant needs to be able to safely manage the situation, and ideally the school would provide training on this, known as Passive Intervention and Prevention Strategies (PIPS) training.
It helps to ask when you start about the support and training available to teaching assistants, and about behavioural policies.
But the best bit about being a teaching assistant?
For many, this is the satisfaction and warmth that comes from their relationships with the children on the pastoral side of the role.
There is undoubtedly a learning curve for the new teaching assistant, so itâs crucial to have conversations with experienced colleagues to help you understand your new role.
Questions for the new teaching assistant to ask and reflect on:
Yes, being a teaching assistant is a brilliant route into teaching.
Teaching assistants have a lot of experience in schools; they understand exactly what they are getting into.
In terms of getting into teaching, any form of experience with children is helpful.
Teaching assistants have a pre-existing network of educators to call on and draw ideas from, which is a powerful aid when training to teach.
They have experts to act as sounding boards, coupled with a confidence from their own experience of school life.
They get the language; they know the processes.
When moving into teaching, a teaching assistant can draw on having seen teachers in action and past discussions with them on how things are done; that really helps when it comes to developing their own teaching style.
Chris continues: âSome of our students were advised by colleagues to get into teaching.
They start out as teaching assistants and someone says, âYouâre good at this, why not be a teacher?â And they think, why not?
They are excited to have their own class, open up their career options, and be better paid.â
Being a teaching assistant is a rich and varied role, and you get to help children blossom into the well-rounded individuals they are meant to become.
Youâll never forget them; and theyâll never forget you.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/professional-development-for-teachers/how-to-support-children-with-mental-health-conditions:
The number of children with mental health issues is increasing.
This is worrying because good mental health is essential to healthy child development.
It enables children to reach developmental milestones, develop positive relationships and cope with problems.
The rising prevalence of mental health issues in children and young people leaves a widening gap between the mental health needs of children and young people and the services available.
Specialist mental health services are overstretched and increasingly other services, including schools, are being called upon to help.
So, as a teacher what can you do to spot and support children with mental health conditions in school?
This is a guide to how teachers can use noticing and naming to interpret childrenâs behaviour and emotions, what they can do to support mental health conditions in school, and when to call on specialist agencies.
Firstly, look for significant changes in a childâs behaviour.
For example, you might notice that a child is withdrawing or has become very quiet, or the complete opposite when a child who isn't usually loud start having angry outbursts or becomes outspoken.
You might notice that a child is withdrawing from social situations, not wanting to join in with play, wanting to sit by themselves or trying to avoid coming to school.
It might be that the child doesnât want to do things that theyâve enjoyed before.
They are not joining in.
They are disinterested, like they canât be bothered with anything, but not in an aggressive way.
When children are really stressed, their cognitive load becomes too much and they revert to basics.
They want to know theyâll be fed, safe, warm, looked after and loved; but they can't take on anymore, like fronted adverbials or bus stop maths.
They might appear not to be interested, but what is actually happening is that they can't take on what theyâre expected to do in the lesson.
They switch off because they've got too many other things going on around them.
This is essentially Maslowâs Hierarchy of Needs in action, to find out more check out our introduction to child mental health theories .
Other early signs of a mental health condition include a marked decline in concentration levels, ability to focus or the child regularly expressing low or negative opinions about themselves.
In addition, if you learn that the child is having sleeping difficulties or observe a lot of tiredness then that's a big clue because mental health problems can lead to very erratic sleep, this is again because of what is going on in the childâs mind.
If it escalates then some children start to self-harm because that's a release for them.
They may do where it canât be seen, but when they're crying out for help some children will deliberately reveal where they've been self-harming because they so desperately want somebody to notice.
Remember that everybody feels low or angry at times.
Youâre looking for signs that are ongoing.
If something is significantly affecting the child and lasting for a long time, that's the time to call on outside expert services.
The child needs someone to listen to them, to do that you first need to build a relationship with them.
Check-in regularly, asking how they're doing.
Theyâll get used to talking about how things are going and how they feel about it, whether things feel good or bad at the time.
Keep this up and theyâll come to know and trust that there is someone there to listen, if they want to be listened to.
In time youâll tune in to them and find it easier to spot when things are difficult for them, even when they're a little bit shaky about telling you.
Alex Parks, Lecturer on child mental health at Plymouth Marjon University, who previously worked with excluded children and those with mental trauma, describes what an effective relationship looks like: âBuilding relationships is key, and that takes time.
It's a slow process because they must learn to trust you.
Be positive in whatever is being said, even if the child is doing something that is undesirable.
Talk through it positively and donât admonish them or shout because the things we say as teachers can make the child feel a whole lot worse about themselves.
"What looks like bad behaviour can be due to mental health conditions; the child can't cope with or talk about what's going on in their life, so things come out in other ways.â
Alex goes on to explain how to use noticing and naming to deal with undesirable behaviour in a positive way: âLetâs take an example where a child with a mental health condition pushes another child.
The best way to handle this is to say something like: âI noticed that you just pushed Alfie and what we need to do is just talk back through that laterâ.
Youâre noticing and naming it straight away; the child knows that you know but you're not admonishing that child in the in front of all the other children.
This helps to build a trustworthy relationship with them, and it also gives them some time to cool off and reflect before you talk it through together.
The child may later feel willing to say that they are sorry to the other child.
But be aware that sometimes the actual words of asking the child to say sorry is a trigger for children who've been abused at home.â
It helps to be able to recognise the triggers .
A trigger is more than just feeling uncomfortable, it is anything that leads to an increase in or return of the symptoms.
Every child is going to have different triggers based on their experiences.
It might be a physical gesture or word that reminds them of something.
It could be something in an image or text that reminds them of the traumatic experience.
For example, seeing a child vomiting in class could trigger a child who has a history of throwing up due to an eating disorder.
Triggers also come from similar feelings, so something could happen in class that reminds them of past feelings.
For example, shame may be triggered in a student who has been abused when they are told off by their teacher.
Itâs important that a triggered child has a safe space to go to.
This could be a quiet corner or a separate space, or older a child may be allowed to say a single word to leave the classroom and go seek support from their mentor or SENCO.
Specialist agencies can help the teacher to establish what the child's needs are, understand the childâs triggers and work out how to get that child back into class and settled again after they are triggered.
Take what children say seriously .
If a child says theyâre feeling down and upset, then hear that.
In the past, many teachers might have said: âNever mind.
Weâll do something else and then everything will be fineâ.
But when a child has mental health problems it doesnât work to say don't worry and itâll all go away soon.
Instead, you want to open a conversation by saying âI hear what you're saying, it's really hard when you feel this way.
Let's talk about things that we can do to try and make things better for youâ.
When talking to young children it can help to have pictures to point to that express their feelings.
They may not yet have the means to articulate it themselves.
Likewise, with young children, it helps to look out for clues in their play as to what is going on in their worlds.
For example, if you observe a worrying behaviour in play, like a child aggressively shaking a doll and shouting at it, that may be a clue that the child has witnessed this somewhere.
Build positive routines for children .
This might mean introducing regulating routines for them in the classroom and encouraging them (and sometimes their families) to eat healthily and do regular exercise.
Also, collaborate with parents on routines and signpost them to help where you can, for example, if the child isnât sleeping that has a knock-on effect to parents who then get very tired, which may exacerbate an already challenging situation.
As a teacher, youâre part of a team and your school will have a process for supporting children with mental health conditions.
Do your part by noting any concerns, typically into safeguarding software such as CPOMS.
This enables schools to link up multiple instances of worrying behaviour to quickly see the bigger picture of what is going on with a particular student.
Recommended resources for supporting child mental health conditions:
Weâre all different, so our personal responses to being faced with a child's mental health concerns will be diverse, but you should expect it to affect you somehow.
If youâre finding it difficult or upsetting to support a child with their situation then donât think for one moment that youâre weak, and donât compare your own reaction to that of other colleagues.
You just do you.
Sometimes youâll hear some traumatic things about what might be going on at home.
It will help you to talk things through.
You need someone to talk to about it in your school setting, this could be your mentor or manager or simply a trusted colleague.
Some teachers find that talking about it at school helps them to not bring it back home.
Seek advice from your GP if necessary.
Other coping strategies include eating well, exercising regularly, catching up with friends, getting out in nature, deep breathing, meditation practice, not working too long hours and keeping yourself well-rested.
Back to Alex for some closing advice on how to cope when supporting children with mental health trauma: âYou want to be noticing and naming what is happening, getting to know your children, and building those trusted bonds.
Also, you need to share information and involve the expert agencies where necessary, but then there's nothing more that you can really do.
That's your job.
Some new teachers especially worry that âI'm not doing enough and wish I could do moreâ.
I certainly did but remember there is a process for these things and it is there to help the child.
"Get to know that process and go with it.
That way youâll be doing the best you can for your student whilst also looking out for your own wellbeingâ.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/how-to-get-into-teaching/how-to-ace-your-teacher-training-interview:
You get an invite to your teacher training interview.
You smile, you’re buzzing.
But with any interview it’s natural for the nerves kick in too; you wonder what to expect and how you’ll perform.
We asked our teacher training interviewers how best to prepare and what to do to shine on the day.
Be encouraged!
An invite to a teacher training interview means that you met the entry requirements and that your written application has already demonstrated many of the qualities needed to be a teacher.
The next step is to fully prepare for the interview.
By preparing, you will feel much more in control.
You'll be able anticipate what you might get asked and ready to talk about the curriculum.
Teachers need to have strong communication, interpersonal skills, and organisational skills.
They also need good subject knowledge, and your future trainers will be looking for these things in you.
Your teacher training interview will be led by university tutors, who most likely used to be teachers, and/or by current teachers.
They want to get a feel for you as a teacher.
The big questions on their minds as they interview you are: Why now?
What experience have you got?
How have you come to this point of wanting to be a teacher?
What skills can you bring to the role?
Kate Brimacombe, Associate Professor of Education and Associate Director of the Teacher Education Partnership at Plymouth Marjon University, explains what her team are looking for at interview:
âWhat we're looking for is motivation, and the reason you want to teach.
We want to know what you think makes for a good teacher.
We're also looking for an understanding of the curriculum and the classroom - what it looks like and what it feels like.
We're not necessarily looking for experience.
While experience is great it's not a prerequisite.
If you don't have experience is then we want to know that you've done your homework, you've read the curriculum and you've looked at education and school websites.
âWeâre looking for the potential to teach, but at a beginner level as we are here to develop and support you.
We're looking for a baseline, the raw skills that we know we can work with.â
Itâs natural to think about the questions youâre likely to be asked and how you want to answer them.
It will help if you read our in-depth look at teaching training interview questions .
Youâll also need to be able to think on your feet.
Make a list of the qualities youâll bring to teaching and relevant skills that youâve developed to date, especially any skills from working in education or with children and young people.
For example, teachers need to be organised, self-reliant and proactive.
They need to be strong communicators, equally able to engage the class and listen to them.
They need to be adaptable, with empathy and patience for others.
These are the skills the interviewers are looking for so make a note of examples were you put them into action.
Keep your list of qualities and skills top of mind so that you can apply them to a range of interview questions.
The interviewers will be trying to establish that youâve really taken time to think about becoming a teacher.
In summary they will want to know:
Your future tutors donât want you to drop-out, so theyâll ask you about how you plan to do things.
Teachers need to be prepared and resilient, so be ready with answers to practical questions about how you are going to make this work.
Itâs a two-way conversation, the interviewer is considering whether they can provide what you need.
For example, if youâre a parent looking after your family then relocating for your teaching placement probably isnât an option, so you need something local.
Or if you canât drive, then you need teaching placements that are accessible on public transport.
They also want to know that youâve got the funding in place; have you got a plan to pay the mortgage?
They are absolutely not trying to catch you out; they want to be sure this is going to work for everyone.
The Teachers' Standards are a set of eight professional standards for teachers.
Trainees must meet them to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
Being aware of the Teachersâ Standards is one way to show that you are a committed and well-informed candidate.
Introduced in 2012, the Teachers' Standards are underpinned by the idea that teachers must make the education of children their first concern and that they must demonstrate certain professional attributes and skills.
Thatâs why you are required to interview for teacher training courses.
You must be suitable for it and you must have the drive and motivation to want to be a teacher.
Teachers come back to these standards throughout their career to review their own progress as teachers.
The Teachers' Standards as published by the Department for Education , are:
Set high expectations which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils
Promote good progress and outcomes by pupils
Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge
Plan and teach well-structured lessons
Adapt teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils
Make accurate and productive use of assessment
Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment
Fulfil wider professional responsibilities
Those are part one of the Teachersâ Standards.
Part two says âA teacher is expected to demonstrate consistently high standards of personal and professional conductâ.
This second part is about your professionalism as a teacher, upholding trust in the profession by treating all pupils with dignity, respect, and tolerance, as well as safeguarding them.
Trainee teachers are tracked against these standards to see how they are getting on and they need to meet all the standards by the end of their course.
Weâll explore interview structure by outlining what teacher training interviews look like at Plymouth Marjon University, but youâll get something very similar with most UK teacher training providers.
As a prospective trainee teacher, you will typically have a group and one-to-one interview.
In the one-to-one interview all candidates will be asked the same questions.
It will likely be a panel interview with both a university tutor and a senior teacher from one of their partner schools.
The group interview differs for primary or secondary candidates.
Primary candidates will be to prepare a five-minute activity in which you teach a small group of your peers â it could be something like making cake in a mug or a simple crafts activity.
This is your chance to show youâre well organised so make sure you prepare and bring everything you need.
Have you brought enough pens, or did you assume everyone would have one?
Do you have a back up of any digital resources in case of tech issues?
Have you got handouts ready to go ahead of time so that everything flows?
For secondary candidates, there is a ten-minute presentation on why your subject matters.
This is your moment to shine so show your passion for the subject.
Be sure to include some real-life examples because they help people to learn and hint at your subject knowledge.
In these group interviews the interviewers are focusing on your interpersonal skills, things like eye contact, how clearly you instruct, how you deal with questions and how you make the learners feel.
Back to Kate Brimacombe, to explain more: âWhat we're looking for in that teaching activity is not the teaching so much but the interaction â the eye contact, how you respond to questions and how you support others.
We're looking for engagement and motivation too.
While the candidate is interacting with adults, we can still see them stood in the classroom and what theyâre like around other people.
Itâs not necessarily about their teaching of fronted adverbials but it's the finer skills, the interpersonal skills, that we're looking for at this stageâ.
All candidates are also asked to create a lesson plan.
This can be produced any way you wish and should include what you are going to teach, what pupils will learn, how you will teach this and what you would teach next.
You want to include what you would do if any issues arose during the lesson, for example if the pupils have not retained knowledge from a previous related lesson or they find a specific aspect of the lesson particularly hard to grasp.
What might go wrong in your interview?
If your interview doesnât lead to the offer of a teacher training place, then itâs not necessarily the end of the road.
You can ask for feedback, do the work to address it and then reapply.
The fact that you reapply wonât disadvantage you, it will actually be looked upon favourably as it demonstrates your commitment to becoming a teacher.
Teachers need to think ahead.
They must be prepared and be able to organise for large groups of pupils.
Your interviewers will be assessing whether youâre the sort of organised self-starter who can do this.
Tips to help you impress at your teacher training interview
Don't worry if youâre nervous.
Everyone will be.
Back to Kate Brimacombe one last time to end with some reassurance:
âDo your homework.
I canât say that enough.
I don't think we ask anything you won't be expecting us to ask but you'd be surprised how many candidates go âOh, I don't know about the primary curriculumâ or âOh, I havenât thought about what affects behaviour in the classroomâ.
Do your research and read around, it can make all the difference.
"Also, we all have complicated lives sometimes, and we're realists, so keep in touch if something goes wrong.
If youâve left your bag on the bus, or your child is ill, or youâve really struggled to free up enough time to do the work then itâs worth telling us.
Weâll work with you as best we can, after all, youâre invited to interview because we like your application, weâre rooting for youâ.

Can you feel it?
Nature is on the rise.
We need to protect our planet and live more sustainable lives.
How can we create the conditions at Forest School for children to really enjoy the outdoors and forge their own connections to nature?
The world is changing, and it starts with our children.
Or put more aptly, it starts with us teaching our children.
Forest School has an important role to play in connecting children to nature as we strive towards a sustainable future for all.
And we're seeing an increasing understanding of how green and blue spaces aid our mental health.
Green times need green minds.
Forest School is a philosophy and a way of working with people in an outdoor environment.
It’s not a specific place, it’s a methodology and an ethos.
See our W article for more info but to summarise:
It is the philosophy, not the physical environment that is essential to forest school.
Woodlands provide an ideal learning environment because of their diversity, but it’s possible to apply the Forest School ethos to promote child-centred learning in other natural environments.
Forest School is a bold effort to bring an alternative form of education to the current situation: it is juxtaposed to the sedentary, academic, and increasingly technological dominant forms of education that we are used to.
So what is Forest School education teaching the citizens of tomorrow?
The main aim of Forest School is not to teach children about sustainability, green issues or how to be a better citizen for the year 2050.
Itâs about childhood, nature, and connection.
It brings children into contact with the natural environment in a time when contemporary concerns about risk and safety may otherwise limit their access to learn and roam in nature.
Before we toot Forest Schoolâs horn too loud letâs provide some context.
Forest School is relatively new; educational research on it is poorly funded and a childâs achievement is shaped by many different circumstances.
It is after all, very hard for researchers to control all the variables that constitute a childâs healthy development.
That being said, there is a huge body of scientific research showing the benefit of green and blue natural spaces for mental health and there is more research being done on childhood and natural spaces.
It is argued that developing this relationship with nature early on (the earlier the better), might not only bring about positive results for childrenâs mental health but also impact their future, and how they act in relation to the environment.
As children are the future policymakers, it would seem appropriate to enable them to have positive experiences with the environment to inform better decision making in the future.
Spending time in nature can promote healthy attitudes towards sustainability and Forest School can foster this connection.
But is this likely to effect meaningful change if itâs not accessible for all sections of society?
After all, the outdoors isnât accessible for all.
According to the Natural Englandâs The People and Nature Survey 2020 you are less likely to visit the outdoors if:
Niky Elvy runs the Curious School of The Wild and is currently studying for her PhD with a focus on the outdoors and social exclusion with a focus on poverty and food.
We asked Niky what aspiring Forest School teachers and outdoor practitioners can do to make the outdoors inclusive:
Here are six principles for how to make Forest School accessible to more children:
The Forest School mantra â there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothingâ sounds good on paper, right?
But what if you canât afford high-quality outdoor kit?
Wellies, waterproof trousers, coats, thermals, all these things come at a high price.
If you canât afford to put food on the table, providing waterproofs for your children isnât going to be a reality.
How can we ensure that every child has the gear they need to focus on the learning and not get distracted by the weather?
Providing food.
Even when itâs free to attend outdoor events, food is often a barrier to participation if families must pay for it.
Providing food for free ensures your sessions are inclusive.
Outdoor knowledge.
Not all families have the opportunity to gain knowledge about the outdoors.
Being judged for not knowing the names of plants or trees is going to exclude people.
Transport.
Consider transport costs, these could stop families with a low income from accessing Forest Schools.
Can you go to where participants are based or stay within walking distance of school?
Be careful of stigma.
Inexperienced staff can sometimes judge participants for not having the right kit, outdoor knowledge or simply for what appears to be laziness.
Surviving socially for young people is important.
If their need to fit-in and be accepted by their peers is clashing with the aims of your outdoor session, donât blame them.
Spending time in the outdoors might be alien for them and it may take time before they feel comfortable.
Keep talking to them, youâll get there.
Procedures.
Do your procedures mean that a person must identify themselves as experiencing poverty?
Setting up routines and procedures to minimise poverty stigma is important.
For example, asking for vouchers or filling in forms in front of other children or families can be damaging for children.
Do you have systems in place to combat this?
Back to Niky Elvy who encourages us to think broadly about what outdoor education is and can be: âI donât describe what I do as Forest School and there are lots of reasons for that.
Many of our staff are Forest School trained and qualified.
But actually, there are lots of things in the Forest School ethos, that donât really fit with ours.
For example, I'm quite happy for my outdoor work to also become curriculum-based if that's what's needed.
I've got a background in education and so that makes sense to me.
âWe also actively don't stay in one setting.
We are semi-nomadic.
Even with our groups who might have a woodland base, we make sure that each time out, we go on a couple of trips to other environments too.
Because you know, being in the woods all the time is great, but that does a very specific set of things and actually, we're trying to provide a bit more.
âWe want the children and young people who are with us, to understand different environments, not just woodlands.
We go to the beach, we go on camps, we go and visit wetlands, and actually, we've even got on the train and gone to the museum.
âWe do a version of adventure education where we take young people out on expeditions and they learn how to navigate, they learn how to use a Trangia stove and then we hammock camp in the woods and they become familiar with a variety of wild environments."
So now weâve considered what Forest School is and how we might get people to consider it, letâs think about the practical activities we can do to make memorable Forest School sessions for our learners.
Forest School is great for developing physical motor skills, self-confidence and an emotional awareness in the natural world.
The activities in the forest can also be applied to the national curriculum, whether itâs understanding the properties of shapes, doing science practicals at the fire pit, or learning the meaning of words through woodland stories.
The outdoors is in fact the perfect place to see how concepts learnt in the classroom can be applied to the outdoors.
Itâs helpful to be aware that some practitioners prefer to keep the time spent in the woods specifically dedicated to the Forest School principals which donât necessarily mean that you to stick to the national curriculum.
This issue is contentious, with lots of different opinions!
3D shapes in nature - understanding the properties of shapes You will need: Sticks, masking tape, leaves, twigs, other seasonally available resources.
Teaching: Ask the children to get into small groups.
Explain to the children you are going to make 3D shapes out of natural things they find in the forest.
Ask them if can name any 3D shapes (cube, cuboid, square-based pyramid, triangular prism etc).
Using twigs or sticks and masking tape to demonstrate how to make a simple square.
Allow children in their groups to choose a shape they want to make.
Explain to them they going to turn their 3D shape into a house or hotel for insects and minibeasts.
Let the children explore and give them time to locate their twigs and sticks.
Once their shapes are complete, get them to fill them full of smaller twigs leaves and place them somewhere for the beasts to move in.
Outcomes: Identify and revise 3D shapes.
Allow children to make choices and understand the different properties and parameters of shapes in the real world.
You will need: Sticks, masking tape, leaves, twigs, other seasonally available resources.
Here are two ways to teach about sustainability at Forest School:
Is a rotting log dead?
By teaching the natural cycles of the earth you will inspire children to see the world differently.
Point out a rotting log on the forest floor and explain how itâs home to a myriad of small beasties such as woodlice and centipedes, as well as fungi and things too small to even see such as bacteria.
As they feed on this essential food supply, the soil is created, which in turn fosters life for more trees.
Take away the rotting logs and there are no more alive trees.
Nothing is wasted.
Celebrate the rain and teach community
Use rainy days as a reminder of how essential rain is to make the forest so green.
Explain how light is essential too and remind them that trees are not only competing for light but also working as a team sharing nutrients we cannot see and acting as a community for other forms of life.

To understand if your Forest School sessions are effective youâll want to observe the children over time.
Start by establishing a baseline of their skills and what their next steps might be.
You can then use this to plan for the subsequent sessions.
Things to consider:
Consider also how what you observe compares to what you see from this child in the classroom.
Youâll start to understand which children thrive in the outdoors.
Forest School is an important part of the tapestry of outdoor learning and itâs ability to teach future generations about our most precious resource, the earth, is vital and needed.

If you’re an educator you’ve most likely had to get to grips with digital learning, probably with about a week to do so when everyone went into lockdown.
Now that you’ve had a go this is our guide to help you tune up your skills in the digital learning space.
Digital learning is any type of learning that is enabled or facilitated through technology.
It is typically accessed via a computer or mobile phone and encompasses lectures, websites, apps, ebooks and ejournals, blogs, podcasts, videos, online communities and forums.
Learning has always made use of the latest technology of the time; once this was the postal service when that was a new thing, then TV and radio, and now online.
All digital learning is underpinned by the ideas of democratic education and social justice because it is available to everyone.
The technology itself has to feel invisible; itâs the medium for learning and it relies on good learning design, but weâll get to how to do that later.
As the pandemic started there was a rush to get everything online.
In that rush, a two-hour in-person workshop was simply translated into a two-hour online workshop.
But now educators are structuring the learning into smaller chunks to help the students to learn at their own pace.
They can go back and re-read tricky topics or accelerate through topics as they choose.
Dr Lynne Wyness, who designs distance learning courses at Plymouth Marjon University outlines more advantages of digital learning in a blended teaching model which combines face-to-face and online: âBy putting some of the learning content online, you free up time for face-to-face teaching so you can go deeper into the questions.
It allows time for mastery.
But it isnât simply a replication of face-to-face learning, youâve got to adapt the teaching.
When you combine the best of digital and in-person learning, then youâve got something really powerful.â
Here are six elements of digital learning to consider:
What technology is available?
How reliable is it?
What do the students think about it?
What are some of the benefits and challenges of it?
What access issues do your students face?
Are there sufficient internet speeds?
Itâs worth remembering that technological issues are one of the cited reasons for drop-out rates being higher in digital learning than in traditional education.
Some organisations use a Learning Management System (LMS) such as Blackboard, WebCT, Moodle, or Canvas to deliver their online learning.
Itâs important to have spaces for educators to come together to share best practice and learning designs, and to troubleshoot and get help when things go wrong.
Karl M.
Kapp, a leader in the field of online learning, outlines these five characteristics of online learning technologies and software:
Did you know that up to 20% of internet users have a disability that could affect their digital learning experience on your website?
This could be hearing, motor or visual difficulties or learning disabilities.
Thankfully, there is a lot of simple stuff that you can do to make your lessons accessible, and by doing so youâll improve the ease-of-use for everyone.
Be clear and concise.
Write in simple language, then rewrite so that you say the same thing but shorter for clarity.
Always avoid jargon.
Avoid special characters and custom fonts.
Swirling fonts can be hard to read and assistive tools read special formatting very differently, if at all.
Just donât do it.
Donât put text over an image; text is harder to read if youâve got a busy background.
Never rely on colour-coding to convey meaning, some people canât see the colour or see it differently from what youâre expecting them to see.
Always provide alt text.
Alt text is used to describe images to people who canât see them so always add it when you use an image.
Provide adequate colour contrasts.
If there is text in your image you need a high contrast between the two colours.
You may need to tweak your brand colours for online - use a colour contrast checker like WebAim .
Always include video captions or a transcript.
Sounds like a lot of work?
It doesnât have to be â Adobe Premiere and YouTube both offer automatic captioning or go to Rev.com for a transcript written by a real human.
Start from the learnerâs perspective.
The basics of webpage design are relevant here because the structure and visual aspects of online learning are key to ease-of-use.
Stick to the same font, the same headings and use a regular amount of white space to break up the page and allow it to âbreatheâ.
Stick to the same terminology, explain that terminology if you need to, and be consistent in terms of navigation.
Always include an intro and an outline of the learning outcomes for the lesson.
Your learners shouldnât feel like they have to learn how to use the platform, aim for intuitive with just the right amount of signposting and support messaging to keep them on track.
Design to avoid âcognitive overloadâ; this is when the educator gives too much information or too many tasks to the learner simultaneously, leaving the learner unable to process this information.
Ask for student feedback to help you evaluate how well your instructional design is working.
Online learning shouldnât be simply telling students stuff.
The effective online educator is there to curate resources, present reflective questions, hold tutorials, and design collaborative activities.
Once youâve selected a good range of content, how do you set that out?
Letâs look to the principles for online learning set out by Clark & Mayer for some answersâ¦
Itâs important that educators acquire a level of video skills.
Back to Dr Lynne Wyness: âVideos have become increasingly more popular â think YouTube, Facebook Live, Instagram TV.
Learners expect to be able to see their teachers.
If youâre in any doubt, go for video and record your lectures in short chunks and in an informal manner, that works best according to the evidence.
"In terms of your own professional development, consider what skills you need to develop?
I would include presentation skills to the camera, basic video recording and editing, podcasting, sound, light and location considerations, as well as script writing.
Go for the highest quality equipment you can get your hands on to cut down on any extraneous processing your learners will have to do.
And if youâre self-filming on a phone get a microphone and a stand as that will help you get a professional finishâ.
One of the roles of the educator has always been to provide resources.
In some ways, it's even more important in the online learning environment because there is so much information out there.
Supply reading lists, links to sources specific to a session, suggested book chapters and textbooks.
When learning is solely online itâs essential to make sure all books recommended are available as e-books, as access to physical books may be impossible for distant learners.
Think about the ways in which you can support learners to understand what is expected of them in their reading - for example, frame questions that help them focus on main points and perspectives, ask them to summarise key parts of the text, give them a rough idea of how long to spend on reading materials, and let them know itâs OK to scan a text for the meaningful points.
Draw on web-based resources, including YouTube videos, podcasts and blogs, and help students develop critical noses for reliable and credible web sources.
And donât forget, once youâve added all your web-based resources, managing these web-based resources also requires regular auditing to ensure resources remain relevant and links are still live.
Designing quality teaching and learning online is no different to designing quality face-to-face teaching - itâs not to do with the technology per se but to do with choosing the best evidence-informed pedagogical approach for your context, appropriate to the purpose of learning and the learner profiles.
So, careful design and planning are key, as they always have been.
Use both individual and group approaches, the latter includes methods such as discussion forums, collaborative projects, tasks with live group feedback sessions or breakout rooms.
One of the challenges facing online learning is that the lack of social presence and interaction can hamper studentsâ experiences of learning.
To overcome this always consider social interaction in your instructional design.
There is research that shows when an online sense of community is actively fostered students report feeling closer to their peers and teacher than they do in face-to-face contexts and that they feel like they learnt more, while educators have reported that written answers tend to be more thoughtful and considered, and that they feel they understand their learnersâ abilities.
Design for community and youâre on your way to designing for success.
How do you know if learning has happened?
Good assessment online is the same as good assessment offline, in both contexts youâre thinking about the same factors or principles of assessment .
One challenge is that online learning presents an environment or context in which it is relatively easy for a learner to copy and paste material other than their own and without citing their source.
One of the solutions to this growing problem is to design authentic assessments.
These are assessments that require the learner to bring something of themselves to the assignment, be it reflections, ideas, applications to practice, or perspectives.
It can also mean that assessments are no longer simply essays but other types of assessment such as presentations, reflective journals, annotated bibliographies, reports, and the creation of resources.
Itâs far trickier to get someone else to do those for you.
The move to digital learning challenges people - educators and learners alike.
Covid accelerated the rise of digital learning and it made us embrace digital learning faster than most of us imagined possible.
As a result, weâve built resilience into the education system and made learning more accessible to all.
Good digital learning is still just good learning and many educators are seeing that and developing engaging new approaches to their learning and teaching practice .
If youâre interested in delving into how to design digital learning in a lot more depth then check out our MA Professional Education Practice .
Would you have imagined say 10 years ago that someone could study their degree over a mobile phone?
Are you interested to see how artificial intelligence and gamification are going to influence digital learning?
The changes so far are really just the start, this is going to be one exciting journey!

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/how-to-get-into-teaching/how-to-become-an-early-years-teacher:
Early Years Teacher Status is a degree level qualification and there are various paths you can take to get there, but ultimately you need a degree which awards Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS).
Degree level qualifications for Early Years typically enrich your knowledge of child development, child psychology and explore the social and political factors shaping childhood today.
This sound underpinning of your practice improves the quality of education you provide to the children.
Jayne Garcia, lecturer in Early Childhood Education at Plymouth Marjon University explains that there is an increasing demand for Early Years Teachers: âThe Early Years workforce is evolving, and it has been since funding was introduced for places for young children.
To receive funding a setting has to have a given number of qualified staff and so weâve seen the sector move from being largely unqualified to being qualified.
For example, settings can have a 1:8 ratio of level 3 practitioners to children.
If they have an Early Years Teacher actively working with those children the ratio changes to 1:13.
There are many benefits for settings that employ Early Years Teacher, it helps keep the wage bill manageable whilst at the same time ensuring high-quality childcareâ.
To be an Early Years Teacher youâll need to achieve Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS), which enables you to specialise in working with children up to five years old.
To achieve EYTS you must meet the Early Years Teachersâ Standards , which are government guidelines for the best professional practice in Early Years.
They cover setting positive expectations, promoting progress, knowledge of early learning, planning and assessment, safeguarding and commitment to the needs of children.
The entry requirements for a degree which awards Early Years Teacher Status are at least a level 3 qualification, such as A-levels, BTEc or NVQ.
To train as an Early Years Teacher you’ll also need GCSE at grade 4 or grade C in English, Maths and Science.
If you already have an undergraduate degree, your best route to Early Years Teacher Status is Early Years Initial Teacher Training .
This is a one-year postgraduate course and is fully funded by the government meaning they pay all the fees.
Up to £7K is available to support your training.
This comes either as a bursary paid to you if you are not working, or it is paid to your employer if you are already working in the Early Years sector.
It covers their costs associated with your training, enabling them to release you to study and keep you on so you can earn while you learn.
It’s worth noting that the government reviews this funding annually so this could change in the future.
If you don’t yet have a degree, then you need to do an undergraduate degree.
Some practitioners get their Early Years degree straight out of school, but most don’t.
Many go straight into a setting after school, get their level 3 qualification and later opt for a degree because they love what they do and want to develop further in their role.
Others aspire to leadership in Early Years , for example becoming a deputy manager, manager or SENCO and they need a degree to progress.
To become an Early Years Teacher, you can do an undergraduate degree that awards Early Years Teacher Status, but it isn’t included as standard, so you need to check.
If you do an Early Years or Early Childhood Studies undergraduate degree without EYTS, you can follow it up with a one-year fully funded postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training.
An undergraduate degree typically takes three years.
An Early Years foundation degree typically takes two years, and you can opt to top it up to a full honours degree with a third year of study if you wish.
You need the full honours degree if you wish to progress to postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training.
Considerations for choosing an undergraduate Early Years degree:
Some undergraduate degrees, such as BA (Hons) Early Childhood Studies come with the Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner Competencies (ECGPCs).
The competencies were developed by the Early Childhood Studies Degree Network (ECSDN) to equip the graduate workforce with higher-level professional skills and focus across a broad range of practice from health to education.
Note though that they do not confer Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS).
The Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner Competencies broaden a graduate’s learning to make them more rounded practitioners.
The Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner Competencies are:
The competencies were introduced to remove confusion amongst settings as to how different Early Childhood degrees align to practice requirements, and to ensure that graduates have the experience and skills that the sector needs.
Dr Helen Simmons, Vice Chair of the ECSDN tells us more:
"The competencies were developed in 2018 by the Early Childhood Studies Degrees Network (ECSDN) in consultation with students, higher education institutions, and employers, with an aim of ‘strengthening a graduate-led Early Childhood workforce that is responsive to workforce needs and improves outcomes for children’ (ECSDN, 2018).
"Students who achieve the Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner Competencies meet the nine competencies through assessed observations of practice, practice-based tasks, and academic assessment.
The competencies recognise and promote both the holistic and contextual nature of childhood and the multi-professional routes that our students and graduates engage with.
These developments enhance reflective practice, graduate employability and/or progression onto postgraduate study including Early Years Teacher (0-5), Teacher (3-11), Social Work, or health professions."
The Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner Competencies, not only serve to strengthen the practice of students and their critical application of theory to practice, but also make an important contribution towards a graduate led workforce for children and families.
It is recognised that quality in Early Years is closely associated with the qualification of the workforce, and the key to high quality is upskilling the workforce.
Most people go into Early Years for love not money, and a degree unlocks leadership roles so you can make a real difference to children.
Back to Jayne Garcia, to outline the value of Early Years education: âItâs long been recognised, since the landmark Effective Provision of Pre-School Education (EPPE) Project , that money spent on early years education pays back.
For every Â£1 invested in quality early care and education, taxpayers save up to Â£13 in future costs.
This happens because the physical and social skills, as well as the maths and reading skills gained in Early Years education, positively influence educational outcomes.
But not just that, quality Early Years education leads to better health and reduces the likelihood of offending down the line.
And the better qualified the practitioners, the better the outcomes for those children at school.
That holds true right through from when they start school to their GCSEs.
The long-term outcome is better for children when their Early Years provision is with a highly qualified workforce.â
Gemma Tanner, Nursery Manager, explains how becoming an Early Years Teacher has made a difference in her practice:
"The best things about my job are working with children, their parents and a variety of other people.
Itâs great when you can get them the help they need and make a difference.
"I did an undergraduate degree in Early Years and then wanted to extend my knowledge and my understanding even further.
I picked a postgraduate diploma, one that included Early Years Teacher Status.
It really improved my knowledge and challenged my practice in a good way.
"It was challenging whilst I was training, especially working as a nursery manager alongside it.
Working full-time meant I needed good time management, but it was enjoyable.
I met new people and weâre still in touch now, sending each other information, itâs really good for networking.
"I was on the course when Covid-19 hit, which added another layer of challenge.
It was good because when we had Covid in our setting a couple of times I could talk to other people who were in the same situation.
It was good to have those people around me, we helped each other through it.
"Training as an Early Years teacher has given me more knowledge and more ideas around child development and supporting parents.
It enabled me to look at what we do and refine it, challenge what we do and change things if we need to.
We have changed the way we run certain things at the nursery for the better because of it.
For example, weâve changed the way we do assessments and that benefits the children by enabling practitioners to spend more time with them."
In the Nordic countries, where affordable high-quality childcare is the norm, 60% of early years practitioners are educated to degree standard.
This is 13% in the UK.
The UK government has an aspiration for an Early Years teacher in every setting but has not yet set out a plan to get us there.
Moreover, graduate leadership in Early Years is associated with narrowing the gap between the most and least disadvantaged children.
The Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY) link this to the diverse ways in which graduate practitioners involve children, simulate interactions with and between children and use diverse scaffolding strategies such as guiding, modelling, and questioning.
They have advanced skills for effective communication with children.
So how do you get accepted on an Early Years course at a university?
Jayne says: âIâm looking for passion for working with children and making their lives better.
Some candidates are already working in Early Years and are looking for the broader knowledge to progress their careers.
Others are career changers, often theyâve had children themselves and it opens their eyes to a career theyâd never thought about before.
Iâm very interested in what drives you.â
Many courses donât interview candidates, so a strong personal statement is essential.
Youâll also need a reference that confirms your suitability to work with children and a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check for safeguarding purposes.
Your personal statement should provide evidence of:
Itâs a great idea to contact the course leader for an informal chat about curriculum of the course - find out how much you are expected to study, how youâll be supported, to generally check that the course is right for you.
Also, this is an opportunity to make a good impression before they see your application.
Early Years Teacher Status is different from Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) which is needed to teach a nursery or reception class in a maintained school i.e.
a state school overseen by the local authority.
Both qualify you to teach young children, but the one you choose sets you on a very different career path.
The main differences are:
If youâre interested in finding out more about training to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (as opposed to Early Years Teacher Status) check out courses like BEd (Hons) Primary Education with Early Years or PGCE Primary .
Early Years Teachers arenât generally paid as much as school teachers.
Most Early Years Teachers are in it for the love of it, but they also get more options to be self-employed.
These range from being a solo freelancer to running their own larger Early Years setting.
Early Years Teachers provide the foundations for the rest of a childâs education.
Itâs a joy to teach (if a bit messy) and every day you get to see children's faces light up because you've helped them to learn.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/professional-development-for-teachers/what-is-forest-school:
Forest School is a child-centred learning process, providing learner inspired, hands-on experiences in the natural environment.
It’s creative and can increase a child’s confidence as they problem-solve and learn to manage risks.
Forest School encourages children to explore the natural environment and learn in it.
How is it done?
What does it take to become a trained leader?
Here weâll introduce you to the concept of Forest School, explore the common questions, and give you solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing Forest School practitioners today.
"If done well, every individual will take away something different from Forest School.
It will enable them to have agency to build relationships.
To commune with human and non-human, to have agency to find that connection from within.
Forest School is about connection, agency and communion."
Jon Cree, Director of the Forest School Association UK
First letâs look at the key characteristics of Forest School:
Check out the full list of principles on the Forest School Association website.
Forest School comes from Scandinavia.
It was developed from the philosophy of friluftsliv (pronounced free-loofts-liv).
This translates to âopen air livingâ.
Concepts such as wild swimming, green prescriptions for mental health and cycling to work have been embedded in Scandinavian culture for a long time.
They live and breathe open air living.
The philosophy of âfriluftslivâ goes deep; it offers a spiritual view, one that is connected to the earth.
There is no restriction on the use of the term Forest School and so some of what is badged as Forest School in the UK isnât truly Forest School, at least not in the Scandinavian sense.
Dr Mark Leather, Associate Professor of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning at Plymouth Marjon University explains: âWhile Forest School makes a very positive contribution to outdoor education, the commodification of it in the UK has created problems.
Sometimes it is done brilliantly but sometimes not, and there is a tendency to make claims for the benefits that overreach the available evidence.â
Whilst being different to the formal education system, Forest School can be used to deliver the curriculum and itâs not an add-on.
Dr Mark Leather continues: âI trained as a secondary school science teacher and I still teach science, I just do so outdoors.
You know, I just happen to be talking about the laws of motion when sitting in a canoe, or the thermal properties of energy transfer when we're sitting around a fire cooking.
You can take many things and teach them in a Forest School setting.
"So how do we bring the outdoors into the education systems that are in place?
In primary schools we're seeing a lot more outdoor education, exploring numeracy, literacy and science by utilising authentic outdoor experiences.
But in some ways, the secondary school curriculum looks very much like a school curriculum of yesteryear.
How do we change that?
The idea of going off on adventures is very much within the British DNA, and that the outdoors is somehow good for you.â
Due to the popularity of Forest School in the UK and further afield, accreditation is now recognised as important to embed the core principles of Forest School in its leaders.
There are three levels of accreditation each varying in price.
Forest School has to be run by at least one level 3 Forest School leader together with one other adult (they can be trained in Forest School or not).
If youâre a qualified teacher then you have a level 6 or 7 qualification so you don't need a level 3 qualification too.
But you need to be able to manage the risks.
Check out this article from the Forest School Association outlining the questions you need to ask your training provider to ensure they are reputable.
You can also search their online data base for registered and endorsed Forest School training providers .
Or to study Forest School at university level study check out our BA (Hons) Outdoor Adventure Education or BA (Hons) Primary Education .
An important part of any Forest School is the longevity and consistency of its group dynamics.
The identity of the group is just as important as the identity of the individuals.
The group includes adults as well as children.
Itâs not ideal when the group is disturbed, and the participants change.
As soon as you lose a member, the feeling and atmosphere of the group can change.
Mark Sackville-Ford in the book âCritical Issues In Forest Schoolâ suggests: âWhere a child leaves a school, rather replace this âspaceâ with another child I suggest that you leave the space as vacant.
Otherwise, you will reset the project and therefore the potential gains from the project can be diminishedâ.
This might seem counter-intuitive because of the desire to provide Forest School to as many children as possible, but the importance of group dynamics in this kind of social education shouldnât be underestimated.
Encouraging and managing risk-taking is also important if you want to provide consistency and create an environment where children feel free to explore.
Here are six managed risk activities that children may encounter at Forest School:
Within all these activities there is a degree of risk.
The three questions you need to ask yourself are: What are the risks?
What are the benefits?
How can we make it safer?
To ensure you are providing in-depth learning, you are adhering to child protection laws, and that you are facilitating a safe session, itâs important you donât work alone.
You must work with at least one other adult.
They can be Forest School trained or not, for example, they could be a competent adult such as a parent, teacher, or volunteer who hasnât received Forest School training but will be on hand and able to respond to emergencies.
Small groups with a high staff ratio are needed to ensure quality learning, at least 1 adult to at most 5 children is something to aim for with young children.
The process of reflective observation is crucial in Forest School, both for the leaders and the learners.
Observations happen over many sessions, and change can happen slowly for the learners.
Allow the process to unfold and grow; like any other process in the natural world, it needs time and care.
Yes, they do.
Practices like Forest School have long recognised the importance of play.
It is essential for the healthy development of a childâs brain.
It enables problem-solving, builds confidence and resilience and contributes to a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and emotional developments.
This is often the aspect of Forest School that can come into conflict with traditional views on teaching.
Children spend much of their lives being transported from one activity or pursuit to another; school, clubs, classes, trips.
Itâs important that they develop the social and emotional skills to negotiate their own actions.
Play is the place this happens; the more uninterrupted by adults the better.
Practices like Forest School facilitate childrenâs play, they donât teach it.
This process requires trust.
This leads us to the question: Do you believe in the power, creativity and agency of children?
Childrenâs agency, which is their ability to act independently and make choices, is a human right.
As The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states: âEvery child has the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.â (Article 31).
Without agency, we are not encouraging resilient future generations.
Given the opportunity, children can and will learn to develop mature responses to challenging situations.
When children are uninterrupted in their play, they learn to negotiate boundaries.
Forest School facilitators are there to support the childâs exploration, but their main job is to create the framework the child freely builds upon.
Itâs said that 9 out of 10 Brits will have talked about the weather in the last six hours.
This is thought to be because some features of UK geography make for changeable and unpredictable weather.
Dr Mark Leather provokes practical questions for Forest School facilitators: âThere is a mantra in Forest School which goes âthere is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothesâ.
I agree with that if it challenges the British stereotype that you canât go out if thereâs a bit of rain.
Let you tell you though, there is such a thing as bad weather.
âI ask the question to my students: âWhy are you here?â What are we trying to achieve?â.
We are not trying to make people unhappy or scared, so go youâve got to be equipped for all weathers.â One of the strengths of Forest School is that it is embedded in core principles that make it distinct and different from other forms of outdoors learning.
Its ability to have a long-term and sustained impact on children and young people makes it an effective approach.
However, being critical of the way Forest School is done will also empower leaders to create better Forest School experiences.
We are not trying to make people unhappy or scared, so go youâve got to be equipped for all weathers.â
One of the strengths of Forest School is that it is embedded in core principles that make it distinct and different from other forms of outdoors learning.
Tree climbing is rarely allowed for children during school hours.
The risk of falling could be severe.
However, tree climbing is one of the most rewarding and engaging experiences in the natural world.
Some children will feel empowered if they are given agency to do something that is usually forbidden.
To manage the risks associated with tree climbing make sure you:
The outdoors is ever-changing so reassess the tree everyone you go back to climb it.
Are the branches intact?
Is it dying?
Is there fungus or rot?
Is it too wet and slippery for climbing today?
"Climbing trees and falling out of them is all part of growing up and having small injuries helps children learn about risks.
We take the view that itâs a good thing to try to equip children and young people and help them make informed decisions about the risks that they take.â
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)
Forest School may come into conflict with the aims and objectives of any given school.
The fact that there are no set objectives and outcomes at Forest School is an alternative to much classroom learning.
Letâs explore the main challenges:
Pressure to make Forest School accountable for how it is directly impacting the child.
Schools are under pressure to hit targets and achieve high ratings and that trickles down from the top.
Being aware that this is an issue is important in creating a cohesive community and culture between the Forest School setting and the wider school or educational setting.
The expectation that this learning will be documented and evidenced.
Some aspects of learning are incredibly hard to quantify.
For instance, itâs hard to evidence the progression of a childâs emotional literacy or feelings of being connected to a wider world.
Be ready and able to articulate how the group dynamics and the outdoors make an effective environment for this social and emotional development.
Expectations that childrenâs learning should be linked to the curriculum.
There are numerous ways to teach Maths, Science, English and many other aspects of the curriculum through outdoor learning.
The practitioner must try to strike a balance between the expectation that Forest School needs to incorporate the national curriculum and the very philosophy of âfriluftslivâ that underpins authentic Forest School experiences.
Clash of approaches between practitioners concerned with safety versus agency of the child.
Other Forest School practitioners may not be fully committed to the âfriluftslivâ philosophy of Forest School.
For some, risk-taking may not be fully embraced or understood.
Finding a mutual and non-judgmental approach between team members is key and making time to discuss your different approaches will lead to deeper understanding.
Forest School becoming a brand and it becoming diluted.
As Forest School becomes more desirable and popular it risks being used tokenistically to promote schools.
Be savvy and research your training providers and settings.
The challenges are worth it.
As children connect physically, practically and emotionally to the natural world, unexpected and delightful changes can occur.
Previously âquietâ children have been shown to improve their confidence in communication, speaking out about their boundaries and feelings.
Similarly, children who were âun-cooperativeâ in the classroom setting have been shown to learn the value of sharing and working as a team.
Every child should have the right to experience the quiet of the forest, the satisfaction of finishing a practical project, the sturdiness of branches as they hold their weight off the ground, the smell of autumn leaves turning into next yearâs soil, the crackle of the fire.
Some children may go on to develop a life-long relationship with the outdoors, influence their parentâs relationship to the outdoors, develop practical skills and potentially go on to have careers in conservation.
But regardless of the effects Forest School has on the world, the child is and should continue to be at the centre.

Leadership in the Early Years is about working in partnership with parents, staff from other agencies and your own team.
Early Years leaders champion an open dialogue that positively influences outcomes for children, developing knowledge and mentoring their team to improve practice.
4 minute read
A lot of people tend to fall into leadership roles in Early Years, often without any training.
Very often promising practitioners get promoted into leadership roles and are faced with new challenges.
How do you balance lots of opinions when managing a team?
How do you manage people who were recently your peers?
How do you develop and evaluate policy for your setting?
How do you develop your team?
Early Years settings are learning communities that thrive when everyone is learning and adapting, and we should all aim to be constantly learning and adapting as leaders too.
Leadership in the Early Years should emphasise listening and communicating, and the team should be encouraged to express opinions to inform decision-making.
Itâs not about saying âIâm in charge so weâre doing it this wayâ but about having a two-way dialogue and listening to your team and your managers.
You need to know what is happening day-to-day in your setting and have an eye on the ever-evolving policy setting.
In practice leadership in the Early Years means doing anything and everything.
Youâre in close contact with parents and other professionals, youâre shaping policy for your setting and youâre there to mentor and support your team.
Youâll still sometimes change a nappy as you have to get stuck in to lead by example.
Leadership in the Early Years is listening to staff, listening to children and families recognising the uniqueness of every child that you're working with.
In terms of policy, leaders may be responsible for budget, health and safety, child development, healthy eating management, leadership, quality, safeguarding, setting the curriculum and child welfare.
As a leader in Early Years youâll also be involved in preparing your setting for inspection by Ofsted, for more info see their Early Years Inspection Handbook .
One day you could be considering the structure of your setting, for example, whether to run mixed age group rooms for 2-5-year-olds or age specific rooms of 2 year olds only, weighing up the relative advantages of mixing older and younger children versus providing only age specific activities and resources.
Another day youâll be preparing very specific policies, for example determining when sun protection is required at your setting, what shading should be available and who should or should not have sun cream applied.
No two days are the same.
People get into Early Years due to a love of working with children.
But to be an effective leader you also need to develop a vision for your setting and deliver a high standard of provision for children.
You need to look beyond the norms of your setting and question why are we doing it that way?
You need to develop an enquiring criticality as well as an understanding of what best practice looks like.
To reach the higher levels of leadership in Early Years youâll generally need a qualification at level six or above or you might opt to become an Early Years Teacher .
It is proven that a highly trained and highly qualified Early Years workforce is good for children, right through from their first year at school to how well they do in their GCSEs.
The Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY) reported: âThe first five years of a childâs life have a long-term impact on his or her future health, wellbeing, and educational attainment.
High quality childcare supports a childâs full development, including creativity, curiosity and self-confidence, which is essential not just for school but later life.
And only high quality childcare has been found to improve childrenâs cognitive and social development outcomes and narrow the gaps between the most and least disadvantaged children.â
You donât have to be the Manager or a Room Leader to start leading.
If you want to be a leader in an Early Years then youâve probably got lots of opportunities to lead.
Ask to take responsibility for something or lead an informal session to share and develop good practice amongst your colleagues.
Small steps like these give you a better understanding of why you do things the way you do.
And by explaining your approach to your colleagues you'll build your confidence (and theirs) in what youâre doing.
When a team member qualifies at level 2 or level 3 there is still a huge amount to learn.
So to improve maintain and improve their skills itâs key that Early Years leaders enable sound mentoring practice .
To mentor is to develop independence, not dependence.
It is future-focused because it aims to upskill the mentee.
Itâs collaborative, requiring commitment and mutual trust between mentor and mentee.
The mentor is ideally a colleague who is not the line manager of the mentee, though many line managers do mentor their direct reports, either formally or informally so donât rule that out.
Mentoring should be confidential, with nothing shared unless there are any concerns about the safety of others.
It also needs defined goals, an agreed frequency of meetings and an end date.
The focus is always on the outcomes for children.
Hannah Holdgate, who leads Early Years teacher training at Plymouth Marjon University, explains why many Early Years leaders are well equipped to start mentoring their teams: âEvery child you work with is going to be different so we need to constantly be changing and thinking about what works best for these children, at this moment in time.
What are their individual unique needs?
We focus on the overriding principle of the unique child, and the importance of having strong relationships and positive relationships.
Actually, when you think about mentoring Early Years team members, a lot of the techniques you already know from supporting young children can be helpful.
Youâre encouraging people to think for themselves, and to problem solve, and thatâs what we do when we're mentoring adults effectively.â
The observe, assess, plan (OAP) cycle can help you to understand what you're seeing.
Observation (O) means watching the children, listening to them and noting what we see and hear.
Assessment (A) is analysing our observations and deciding what they tell us about the childâs progress, and understanding the childâs needs as expressed by the parents.
Plan to support (P) is being intentional about the next steps in the childâs development and learning.
Mentoring is about developing listening skills, communication skills and being able to reflect on your practice.
It also means being willing to learn and to grow from your mistakes.
There are lots of models around mentoring but Holdgate advocates developmental mentoring models, which involve everyone learning from each other.
The alternate being sponsorship models where the mentor is considered more knowledgeable and directs the (usually younger) junior practitioner.
She explains: “Just because I have more experiences than someone else, or they have more experience than me, it doesn't mean we can't learn from each other.
It’s a co-existing relationship, after all you’re both trying to provide the best possible care for the children you're working with.
The developmental mentoring model focuses both mentor and mentee on the unique child and the best possible outcomes for them.
They listen to one another and understand that no-one has dealt with exactly this situation before because every child is unique.”
Effective mentoring means getting people to think for themselves, to keep trying and to reflect on their practice.
Let’s take the example of a mentee encountering a child who bites.
An early years practitioner needs to know that there are heaps of reasons why a child might bite and should think and reflect on what might be happening.
The mentor can help by asking questions like:
In this way, the mentee learns to question the situation.
Is the child who bites feeling frustrated or trapped?
Is it to do with teething or sensory processing?
Are they copying another child?
The mentor can guide the mentee to be aware of antecedent behaviour, that’s the behaviour that precedes the biting, and ask them what they’ll do if they observe the child doing it again.
We are richest when we're diverse and different, and value lies in getting people to question things for themselves.
If we all think the same then that won't get the best outcomes for the children in our care.

You may have a lot of questions about getting into teaching, but there are so many articles with the same old answers.
Don’t worry, we’ve got real answers from real teachers who trained right here at Plymouth Marjon University.
Before we get the lowdown, letâs meet teachers Chloe and Johnson.
Chloe Carrubba is an English teacher in a secondary school: âWhat I enjoy about teaching is that you are always bettering yourself, being reflective and improving.
I love that because it means every day Iâm striving to do better.
My favourite aspect of the job is just being in the room with young people.
Theyâre funny, theyâre clever, theyâre bright, theyâre hopeful.
Teaching through a pandemic was challenging, but one of the most rewarding things Iâve ever done.â
Johnson Wenner is an upper key stage 2 leader in a primary school, a Year 6 class teacher and PE coordinator.
He says: âOne of the key things that sold teaching to me was all that support that you get in the build-up process.
I don't specialise in one specific area.
I've got multiple things I want to teach and can teach content in a creative way.
I'm quite diverse and adaptable.
I get to react on the spot and decide that âIâm going to do this insteadâ.
Being able to stand out in front of the class and bring what theyâre learning alive really helps students to take it in, and that inspires me.â
Even if youâre teaching the same subject and the same class, every day is different.
Each pupil brings their own ideas and so there is always something new to discuss.
Chloe explains how learning can be collaborative and shaped by the response of the pupils in any one class: âIâll be reading with students, watching them connect with new texts and authors, and applying their perception of the modern-day world to Shakespeare.
I think it's incredible how they make those links and make it relevant to today.â
Pupils bring new perspectives every day, they open your eyes to new possibilities.
Back to Chloe to tell us more: âWhat I enjoy about teaching is that youâre always bettering yourself and going through a process of being reflective and improving.
There's no end and I personally love that because it means every day I'm striving to do better.
It keeps me young whilst giving me a few grey hairs!
There's never a day where I do something and I think it worked by fluke because youâre always kind of analysing and constantly trying to do better.â
Even while your school guidelines and the national curriculum set out what you must teach, you have freedom in the ways you teach.
For example, take maths - you can choose to write our sums, or get practical by counting objects or building towers, or go outdoors to look for shapes, or have one child recap the lesson with another child so that learning is reinforced for both.
You also need to get creative in the moment as Johnson explains: âSometimes you have to say 'I haven't got time to do this', or you need to adapt things or multitask.
Just take every day as it comes.
Sometimes the plan doesn't work so you must learn to deviate from it.
Understand the context and try and get everything ready before.
But if things are becoming too much itâs okay to go off the plan and adapt to the way the children are working.
For example, maybe you run out of time to mark work so you could give some verbal feedback instead, which is sometimes more meaningful to the children anyway.
Go with the best way for the children to learn at the time.
Always recognise that things can be adapted, you don't have to stick to the plan, sometimes you need to be flexible to get the best outcomes for the childrenâ.
Chloe adds that one key skill for all teachers is being able to connect: âTeaching is a lot of skills coming together, but the main one is being able to connect with young people, so make sure that you have that connection and are willing to develop it further before you go into teaching.
That's the one thing that can't be taught.
If youâre thinking about going into teaching then give it a try first, for example I was a professional singer and I had the opportunity to lead singing workshops with groups of children.
That enabled me to teach and see whether or not it was something I enjoyedâ.
At first, like when you start with anything new, there will be things that feel hard.
Johnson remembers this from his early experience as a trainee: âOne of the things I struggled with at first was the workload management, for example organising and getting plans together.
But challenge isnât necessarily a bad thing and as a new teacher you do get extra time in the day outside of the classroom to catch up on lesson plans.
And if you stay in the same year group then you've got that planning ready for years to come, you just adapt itâ.
As a trainee suddenly being emersed in teaching can be a huge change and Johnson found youâve got to be intentional about striking a good balance: âI had my university work, but I was also being offered more opportunities in schools that I was desperate to take.
The challenge for me was find that balance in terms of professional practice and keeping on top of my university workâ.
Many teachers and trainee teachers agree that seeing the childrenâs progression is the most rewarding part of teaching.
Johnson explains: âThe children are wonderful.
Iâve always had the mindset that a child is probably looking forward to the day with you, that's why I went into teaching - to help other peopleâ.
Many teachers say they sign up for the job to make a real difference.
As Johnson explains, because you care you sometimes can't help but think about the children in your downtime: âSometimes you do struggle with the pastoral side of things when you know that difficult stuff going on in the child's life.
You do go home sometimes thinking about that.
You can never really leave those things at the door, but I see that as a positive, because I go home and relax and then I can better see how I can do it differently tomorrowâ.
There is joy in helping a child to succeed.
It can come from seemingly small things, but with each small thing you see the child grow in confidence.
For example, when one of Johnson's pupil's overcame a physical challenge in PE.
He tells it like this: âChildren are so capable and sometimes they surprise you.
I had a recent instance with a child who has hypermobility issues, they often wonât give things a go in PE because they worry that it is going to really hurt.
We had gymnastics and I said to the children 'Let's see if you can hold a balance for 30 seconds'.
I set it up as a choice and the child with hypermobility chose to try it and held the balance for the full 30 seconds.
Those moments inspire you and then you go home with a smile on your face.â
Chloe echoes that sense of motivation to do your best by your pupils: âI think sometimes teaching can be seen as an easy route.
And I tell you itâs not, it's a hard route but incredibly rewarding.
I wish I could go back and tell myself that this was what I'd always meant to do, was always meant to do.
I wish I could go back and tell that to little trainee me.
You get those moments when you know you're really making a difference.
I want to make a difference for young people, and I know that in this job I do that every day and that's amazing.â
As a teacher you teach so much more than simply the academic subjects; teachers are great role models for their students, and they shape their future with the passion they bring into the lessons.
Teaching offers half terms and longer holidays than most jobs but is still renowned for long hours.
Most schools understand the importance of a good work/life balance for teachers and flex when they can.
It is accepted that teachers sometimes do need more time out of class to catch up on other jobs, such as marking and planning.
Johnson says: âIt's not 8.30 to 3.30, it's a bit more than that, but with the Ofsted framework that's coming in teachers work life balance is improving significantly.
I see that myself.
Sometimes we get more time out of class for planning, with teachers to cover us so that the time is there.
You do get some time out for family things too.â
Good teams share workloads collaboratively and efficiently to reduce it for everyone, for example creating and sharing a lesson plan or ensuring no-one is doubling up on paperwork.
In addition, working in a team allows teachers to bounce ideas off each other and adapt the ways they do things.
There is more support available for new teachers than ever before thanks to the new Early Career Framework which guarantees further training and mentoring for two years after qualifying.
There are always opportunities to try new things and tune lessons and methods.
There is no right or wrong way to do your teaching job (if you stick to school guidelines and the curriculum!).
If you are doing something well there is always a way to reflect and improve it, and there are clear career paths so you can see where you might want to go in future.
Feel tempted to teach?
If so, then you could see our teacher training courses , find out how to write your teacher training personal statement or check out the teacher training survival guide for the inside track from trainee teachers.

You may have heard about green spaces being good for your mental health.
Recently, the conversation around spending time in nature and it being good for you, has exploded.
People are now talking about ‘blue mind’, the science of how spending time near water can improve your health and wellbeing.
Whatâs so special about water?
Well, put simply: we are water.
We came from water, we are made of water and we live on a water planet.
Ok, itâs starting to sound a bit sci fi.
Let's explain.
We spend the first nine months in the womb literally surrounded by water.
Our bodies are 60-70% water, which is why we can float in water, and our planet is 70% covered by water.
Oh, and we come from the sea.
No, not as mer-people: we evolved and all that.
But more importantly, we are inspired by water.
We love walking by it, swimming in it, sailing on it, fishing in it.
We base our towns and cities around it, we write about it, take pictures of it, surf it, drink it, wash with it.
Water restores and relaxes us, captures our imagination, and sparks our most romantic moments.
Now stop reading this article and try to imagine your favourite cities and natural spaces without water.
We bet they donât cut the mustard anymore?
We all have mental health that we need to nurture and look after.
Since March 2020, the phrase âzoom fatigueâ has entered the popular lexicon.
Many of us can relate to the feeling.
It describes that drained feeling from too much work online, too much social media, too much information.
Thankfully, the effects of stress and the effects of being calm are being studied.
In fact, thanks to neuroscience (the study of the nervous system and the brain) we have learnt a lot about the brain in recent years.
Neuroscience puts us at a great moment in human history when we can try to understand what makes us feel good, and surprisingly some of the answers can be quite simple.
Thatâs right, weâre back to talking about water.
If youâre able to leave the classroom and venture into the school grounds or further afield, then water can be a great way to not only teach children about nature, but also to bring the benefits of Blue Mind to them.
Here are some tips:
Find water.
Weâre not all lucky enough to live by the sea, fortunately though, we donât need to if we want to get the benefits of water.
Hunting down any patch of water no matter how small can be of huge educational and emotional benefit to children.
Canals, rivers, ponds and even fountains are all perfect locations.
Learn about the natural world.
Sounds simple, but itâs a lifelong journey.
Here in the UK, we have a fantastic variety of water-loving species of animals and plants.
Equipping your students with the skills to identify them, whether thatâs through ID books or apps such as Seek will empower them and build their connection to blue spaces.
How do you feel?
Even the most built-up and urban environment can have fantastic sources of water and wildlife.
Encourage a moment of quiet time.
As the children to pay attention to the sounds, smells, sights and ultimately, they'll connect to their feelings when in blue spaces.
This might be hard at first, but by making this a regular question it will become easier for them with time.
Give back.
Another way to deepen your classes connection to nature is to give back, itâs empowering and important for motivation.
One of the simplest things you can do is a litter pick.
We are hardwired to have a positive response to being near water.
For example, the Health in Coastal Communities report found that while coastal communities do face health challenges, they are "generally intrinsically healthier".
Those living closer to the coast report better health on average than their inland counterparts (after controlling for socio-economic and demographic influences).
Further studies have found you donât need to live by the sea to get the benefits, even just visiting it reduces stress.
In fact, some research shows that simply looking at aquariums can calm patients who are about to undergo medical surgery, lowering their heart rate and blood pressure and increasing positive mood.
Even just looking at the colour blue can chill us out.
âReally?â you ask.
Lower your eyebrows and let's talk hormones now.
Cortisol is the primary stress hormone.
It can be provoked by the continual use of technology and phones.
Oxytocin is associated with love, empathy, and trust.
We get oxytocin when we are experiencing that awe at the natural world.
We are evolved for a changing outdoor environment.
Water is constantly changing.
Itâs waterâs ability to capture our attention that seems to be one of the reasons why it calms us down.
The whole experience of walking along the beach for example enables you to see changes in light, changes in movement and your gaze softens on the gentle repetitions of the waves.
It is this feeling of tranquillity or awe, which helps people suffering with anxiety and depression shift the focus away from their own issues and on to the external environment.
We all need to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves, and what more tangible thing to feel connected to than the ocean.
So, whatâs actually happening when youâre by the coast?
It's not just about gazing at the ocean, there are other important factors too.
People tend to engage in more physical activity when by the coast such as surfing, flying a kite, walking the dog, playing on the beach, swimming, rock pooling, the list goes on.
Also, people are likely to have positive social interactions by the sea.
All these things promote good physical and mental health.
Using Blue Mind to talk about the health of our oceans is an important aspect of educating children on the importance of water and how it connects and sustains us all.
There are some great resources out there that help to not only educate, but also empower children.
Weâre really proud to count Cal Major as one of our honorary graduates and we canât help but be inspired by her when we think about Blue Mind.
Here is her story as she told it to our studentsâ¦
âItâs 4am.
Iâm in the middle of the sea in Scotland approaching one of the most dangerous headlands in the British Isles.
Iâve been on the water for 5 hours already, on my stand-up paddleboard, which is basically a glorified surfboard.
I have a very narrow window of time to get around this headland, but all I have to navigate with to get there is a GPS watch and a lighthouse on the point flashing every 30 seconds.
Apart from that, itâs pitch black.
The body of water Iâm in also happens to be a military firing range.
"Why am I here?
Iâm attempting to stand-up paddleboard the entire length of the UK.
Itâs never been done before.
(Note: It has been done now because Cal did it!).
"Rewind 2 years, and I was just setting to paddle the entire Cornish coast to Croyde.
I had moved to Plymouth in 2014, and took up SUP.
I very quickly rekindled a deep love and respect for the ocean.
But I was finding plastic on every beach I went to, after every surf, every SUP.
I had to do something about it.
So my mission around the Cornish coast was to talk to people about plastic, and bring some positive solutions to this enormous issue.
"I know a lot of us will care deeply about our environment, and will have been quite affected by the issues it currently faces - climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the collapse of ecosystems, plastic pollution.
It can feel incredibly overwhelming looking into the eyes of these issues and wondering how on earth one person can do something to make a difference.
"One of my favourite quotes is from Jane Goodall, it goes: âI like to envision the whole world as a jigsaw puzzle...
If you look at the whole picture, it is overwhelming and terrifying, but if you work on your little part of the jigsaw and know that people all over the world are working on their little bits, that's what will give you hope.â
"Thereâs another reason to protect our planet and our natural world.
It is crucial for our wellbeing.
Spending hours at a time on the ocean helped me to realise how much noise there is in our society, and how crucial it is for us to find time and peace in nature.
"Always make sure to take time out for yourself, and if you havenât tried it yet, time out in nature is an incredible way of rebalancing the scales.â
Stress is implicated in many modern health care diseases.
Remember cortisol?
That scary sounding hormone we learnt about earlier.
Well, it turns out lots of cortisol leads to inflammation.
This is why stress is not only bad for our mental health, but also our physical health too.
There is global interest in the idea of âgreen prescriptionsâ these are social prescriptions for people suffering from mental health problems whereby they can access more nature and green spaces.
BlueHealth, an organisation studying the effects of blue spaces in cities, are exploring the effects of water on our mental health and they are promoting the idea of âblue prescriptionsâ too.
Itâs not just the ocean that makes us feel good because canals, rivers, lakes and even fountains are important in our connection to water and our happy selves.
Spending a minimum of two hours a week in blue spaces is recommended.
Any more is a bonus.
But of course, itâs not always that simple.
Living closer to blue spaces is more important for people on a lower household income, because they may have fewer resources to access these spaces further away.
Others are less mobile and so are extremely limited in their access to blue spaces.
Researchers have been trying to bring the magic of the sea, into care homes using Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and 360Â° interactive recordings of the sea.
âBlue mind and green mind are great.
They are about relationships.
If we have a relationship with the seal that we see, or the moss, or the seaweed, or the crab, or we have a relationship with the smell of the sea, or the smell of the river in autumn as it comes through peatiness or the colours of the leaves or the birdsong, then we feel good.
"I could go to the same outdoor location every single day and it would be different, because every single day youâd see the fine nuances.
if I can introduce people to that then we can start to talk about the environmental crises facing our world.â
Dr Mark Leather, Associate Professor of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning at Plymouth Marjon University
You might not need convincing of the awesome power and tranquillity of the sea.
However, understanding its effects is powerful if you care about mental health, the environment, and the future health of our cities.
Plymouth Sound is now the UKâs first National Marine Park .
The aim is to protect wildlife, promote businesses and provide more people with access to the sea.
The National Marine Park demonstrates that our seas are just as important as our land.
The aim is to get far more people in, on, under and by the sea.
We live in a time of mental health crisis.
For societies to move forward, individuals must feel happy and connected to themselves.
That journey can start by the water, it can start small and it can start today.

So, you’ve been offered an interview for teacher training.
It’s very exciting news and it’s natural to feel nervous too.
But no fear, we’ve put together a list of teacher training interview questions to help you prepare and get you one step closer to your dream of becoming a teacher.
Weâll start with some general tips and then go on to explore some teacher training interview questions.
Youâll hopefully find that the interview process is a supportive one â the interviewers are trying to find out whether this is going to work for you.
The interviewers are typically university tutors and teachers from placement schools.
They are not trying to catch you out.
Generally, there are no right or wrong answers.
The interviewers want to see who you are, what you are passionate about and how you present yourself.
Sally Eales, Senior Lecturer in Primary Education at Plymouth Marjon University, explains what her team look for: "What we are looking for is potential.
We always stress at the beginning of the interview that we are not looking for the finished article, otherwise, you wouldn't need to come on the course.
Weâre looking for your personality to come through, we want to see a passion for the profession and that desire to make a positive impact on childrenâs lives.â
Before we explore teacher training interview questions, letâs take a quick look at first impressions.
First, make sure that you are on time, or early, and that you are dressed professionally i.e.
simply dress like a teacher.
Think about how you behave from the moment you walk into the building.
Your behaviour towards everybody will be noticed so be sure to act professionally and respectfully when talking to everyone including other candidates, current trainees and any of the staff team you interact with.
Youâre on interview the whole time you are there.
You might like to check out more tips on how to ace your teaching training interview .
You are not expected to have in-depth knowledge of teaching at the interview â you will learn that on the course.
But you do need to show that you have the potential to become a teacher.
You want to be confident, but not arrogant.
Your overriding aim is to show that you have the right characteristics to go into teaching, that your potential is there.
Consider both the positives and negatives of teaching before going to an interview.
You want to come across as positive but also it is important that you do not appear to be naive.
Be enthusiastic, show off your passions and be polite to everybody you meet.
Showing you have the right characteristics to be a teacher is the most important thing.
The exact questions will vary between teacher training providers, but broadly speaking, teacher training interview questions typically span the following topics:
Read up on the national curriculum and if applicable the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework online.
You can develop your understanding of current issues in education by speaking to current teachers or by reading the TES , BBC Education or Guardian Education websites.
Weâll now explore in detail three questions youâll likely be asked at any teacher training interview.
Weâre all different so there isnât a model answer, but you can go into this understanding exactly what the interviewers are looking for.
Youâll almost certainly be asked this one.
This is personal and specific to you â so make sure to give an honest answer.
Explain how you got to this point.
Talk about the experiences that led you to choose this career path, why you enjoy working with children, what makes you passionate and how you hope you can support the children who will be in your care.
Top tip!
Watch your language, or more precisely, take care over your spoken English.
If your language is very sloppy, that might raise a question mark over your ability to teach.
Youâll be expected to model well-spoken language in the classroom, indeed the Teachers' Standards (which all teachers must stick to) include the correct use of standard English and high standards of articulacy.
Questions like this are designed to get you thinking, not just about the characteristics of a good teacher, but about also your qualities and how they match up.
Perhaps you can think of an inspirational teacher you remember from when you were at school, what made them so great?
Or maybe you can remember a teacher who struggled to get the classes attention â again think about what qualities they lacked?
After that, you can discuss your own qualities.
Talk about how you will communicate and how you will support and care for the children.
There are two parts to this question.
If you are asked a question with multiple parts, it may be useful to repeat the question back to the interviewer or ask them to repeat it.
This will help you form an answer in your head and clearly define the three separate points to consider.
It is important to remember that questions like this are not asked to trip you up.
The interviewer is not going to say, âYou are not confident at teaching science and therefore, you canât become a teacher.â They are trying to assess your self-awareness and ability to judge yourself fairly.
The question is about seeing if you are taking responsibility for your own subject knowledge development.
Itâs crucial because teachers must always keep up with their subject knowledge.
They are looking to see that you have a realistic view of your own subject knowledge, so talk about your relative strengths and weaknesses.
They want to see that you can identify your abilities and be reflective about where you are at.
Talk about your strengths and give examples to support your case.
The subject that you're least confident in, talk about what you might do to improve that.
If you say you are fine with everything then this may indicate that youâve not adequately considered this.
While you were reading about the questions, did any ideas pop into your mind about what you might say?
If so, make a note of those ideas right now and you can add to them over time.
Try saying your answers out loud, it's one thing to have a mental answer prepared and another to vocalise it in a clear and convincing way.
Say your answer a few times until you get smoother.
Next, ask a family member or friend to put the questions to you and then answer them.
Practice makes perfect and all that.
Work on it until your answers are clear and concise, this way you demonstrate that youâve got the communication skills youâll need in the classroom.
Youâll be asked questions about core aspects of the teacherâs role, things like classroom management, managing behaviour, safeguarding, inclusive learning and supporting children with special educational needs.
The interviewers will want to see that you understand all the different influences on the child, including the teacher, what is happening in the classroom and wider aspects of the childâs life.
Youâre not expected to be an expert, simply to outline what you understand so far and if possible, give some examples which youâve seen in schools or other child and youth orientated organisations.
Your interviewers want to see your commitment to the course and to teaching.
They may ask you why you choose this course and this particular route into teaching.
If you are interviewing for School Direct then they are also looking for commitment to the training school.
You can express this by talking about what youâre most looking forward to studying.
Are you excited to go on placement?
Are you looking forward to learning more about supporting children with special needs?
Are you excited to study the theories behind different teaching approaches?
Whatever it is that you are most interested in, this is your chance to talk about it!
Donât be afraid to ask questions.
You want to make sure this is the right course for you.
Do you have practical questions about how youâll travel to placement?
Do you want to make sure that you have a personal development tutor?
Do you need to balance study with caring for your family?
If so, you may want to find out how the training provider can support you.
Speak openly about the challenges you might face on the course, for example it may be that you are returning to student life for the first time since leaving school, you may want to find out how the university will support you academically.
Ask away, remember the interview is a two-way process.
By the end of the interview process, you may find that all your questions have already been answered.
Donât feel that you must ask something.
But if you do have questions, take this chance to ask the experts!
Also, if current trainees are around then this is an opportunity for an informal chat to find out even more about the course.
Weâll end by going back to Sally for some last words of encouragement: âWeâre looking for transferable skills that youâll bring into teaching.
These include things like communication, leadership, planning, problem-solving and relationship building.
Remember that teacher training interviews are designed to explore your potential to teach.
It could be there whether youâre 17, or youâve already worked in schools, or youâre coming into teaching as a career change.
Good teachers can come from all walks of life, and itâs a richer learning experience for the children when they do.â
Good luck, and if youâre interested in teacher training you might like to check out our teacher training courses .

No two people's needs are the same.
An understanding of the different models of disability, and of how people experience disability and special educational needs, will prepare you to support every child with the care and support they deserve.
8 minute read
Understanding different models of disability can open up your own thinking about special educational needs and disability.
They help you to understand the complexity of peopleâs experience and open up more meaningful conversations on disability.
And insight into the discrimination that your students may encounter helps you to become a self-reflective practitioner.
But before we dive into the models, remember that they are just tools for thinking about a topic.
They are simplistic and canât wrap in all the nuances of real life experience.
Dr Jonathan Harvey, Senior Lecturer in Special Educational Needs and Disability at Plymouth Marjon University, puts it like this: âThere is no simple answer, but the one bit of advice I would always give is to come into this knowing everyone's an individual and to treat them on that basis.
No two people's needs are the same so it's a lot more complex than saying âthis is how you teach an autistic pupilâ or âthis how you teach someone who has ADHDâ.
If you have the ways of thinking and the tools, you can apply them to different situations and understand each individual's needs a lot betterâ.
The social model of disability is a way of viewing the world that can empower disabled individuals.
It makes a distinction between an individual's impairment and their disability.
It emphasises the barriers in society that disable people with impairments, not the impairment or difference itself.
Barriers can be both physical things, like buildings or information not being accessible, or they can be caused by peopleâs attitudes to difference and assumptions about what disabled people can and canât do.
The social model of disability recognises that attitudes and negative stereotypes can reinforce discrimination and misunderstanding around disabled people.
For example, these attitudes might include feeling pity for disabled people, thinking disabled people canât live and work independently, thinking disabled people canât have children or assuming that disabled people are courageous and citing them as inspiration for facing up to adversity.
The social model helps us recognise and remove these barriers, promoting equality, independence, and control for disabled people.
The social model of disability was designed by and for disabled people and reframed disability as a civil rights and equality issue.
It has been important in driving social and political change.
But not everyone agrees with it, for example some feel it is overly simplistic or that having been around for 30 years it needs re-invigorating to reflect changes in society.
It is argued that with these societal changes, a more sophisticated view of disability has developed.
For example, feminist disability studies reimagine what it means to be disabled, and the discussion has expanded around trans, gay and people from minority ethnic backgrounds who are also disabled and a growing dialogue around identity is emerging.
Increasingly there is a challenge to the notion that disability is a deficiency, but more of that later.
Back to Dr Jonathan Harvey to explain further: âThe social model of disability transfers focus away from the individual person to environmental things like easy access doors, hearing loops or lifts.
There are many ways we can make environments accessible for all people.
As a result classrooms have changed massively over time to become more inclusive, they are now accessible to more children.
We need to couple these accessible environments with an increasing focus on understanding individual talents.
For example, say youâve got a dyslexic child who struggles with spelling, then easy access to a computer with spell check rapidly transforms their experience of spelling.
It becomes less of a struggle and that is good for their overall confidence.
Our job is to spot that child and help them play to their strengths, and technology can be a big enabler hereâ.
In contrast to the social model, the medical model of disability emphasises that people are disabled by their impairments.
It focuses on what is âwrongâ with the person and looks to medical care to fix the person or provide special services from them.
Many people believe this is disempowering and leads to a lack of control for disabled people.
Letâs look at some examples to demonstrate the difference between the two models:
It's important to understand where the stigma around disability is coming from.
It has to do with self-identification; this is especially important in schools.
As children grow and develop, they learn to identify themselves.
Part of that process of determining what you are is to identify what you are not.
As an educator working with disabled children, it's crucial that you understand how they identify themselves.
By learning about their view of themselves, youâll better understand their actions.
For example, a child with autism may be stigmatised by the rest of their class.
Understanding the social effects of disability and challenging the stigma around it is vital for you to listen and seek to understand disability identity and culture.
How do you do this?
Not all disabilities are visible.
Some disabilities do not present themselves in a physical form.
Unfortunately, people often judge another person based on what they can see; this is equally disempowering for people who appear unable but are capable and those who appear able but are not.
Invisible disabilities, according to the Invisible Disability Association , include symptoms such as debilitating pain, fatigue, dizziness, cognitive dysfunctions, brain injuries, learning differences and mental health disorders, as well as hearing and vision impairments.
It's important to know that not all disabilities are visible.
Assuming a person isn't disabled just because they don't appear to be can reinforce prejudice; it's essential to listen and treat everyone as an individual.
There is advice and support out there to help us to better understand invisible disabilities:
We're starting to understand that some so-called disabilities are arguably better thought of as an unusual pattern of strengths and weaknesses, and that with the right support people can thrive.
ADHD/ADD âI found out I had ADHD/ADD in my third year at university, whilst I was in the middle of trying to write my dissertation.
I had always had trouble paying attention.
Most of my school reports through both primary and secondary feature words to the effect of: âGood pupil, but gets distracted easily, and distracts others.â "If I had a quid for every time I lost my train of thought, Iâd be absolutely minted.
Thereâs this thing called Hyperfocus, which sits at the other end of the scale of attention deficit.
Just like losing attention or becoming distracted is a common symptom of ADHD/ADD, Hyperfocus means I focus in on something so much that I tune everything else out.
"People have had whole conversations with me, and Iâll be zoned in (or out, depending on which way you see it) so much that I donât hear a word.
My other half throws cushions at me, that tends to work.
So, time management and attention span can sometimes be extremely challenging for me.
But once I get into a rhythm and focus, I can get loads done in a short timeframe.
Perks.
Sometimes, I feel like Iâve got superpowers.
"Itâs safe to say that none of this had come as a shock to me or anyone in my family.
Iâd always known I didnât learn the same way as everyone else but couldnât quite put my finger on how or why.
I wonder how differently my life in education might have been if Iâd found out earlier.
"I actually consider myself to be really lucky.
The Disability Inclusion & Advice Service (DIAS) at Marjon were brilliant in helping me, and giving me the right support.
So, with all my new-found ways of working, I finished my dissertation, handed in all of my other work, got more work experience.
I graduated with a first-class honourâs degree in Journalism, and Iâm about to start work as a Reporter.
Iâve learned a lot about myself during my time here.â Alex, Journalism graduate

"You might think of dyslexia as being all about problems with reading and writing.
For sure those are challenging for most people with dyslexia, but thatâs far from being all there is to it.
Dyslexia is about how you decode and process any information including written words, spoken words and even the ideas in your own head.
It is often framed as a disability, even the word itself tells us this, with dys meaning poor and lexis meaning language.
But Iâm dyslexic and I donât think itâs a disadvantage.
In fact, sometimes it can be quite the opposite.
"Dyslexia is an alternate wiring of the brain.
It is a different way of thinking that comes with challenges but also certain strengths.
"It generally takes the dyslexic mind a while longer to process new information.
This applies to any type of information, it is as true for conversations as it is for textbooks.
"The best thing for me about being dyslexic is the eureka moments.
Dyslexic minds are good at making interconnections.
It might take my brain a while to get from A to B, but thatâs fine.
I know that for me learning isnât linear, that there will be a eureka moment.
I suddenly get from A to B.
Only I donât stop at B because Iâm already at C and maybe I even see D on the horizon; D is an outlier but I see a connection.
It is exhilarating to think like that, ideas popping into your head, it feels like everything lights up.
And this interconnected thinking makes you good at problem-solving too because you can always find another angle from which to look at things.
"Dyslexic individuals are good at making big picture connections.
If Iâm working on a big question then Iâll easily engage with it.
I can relax into it because I know that Iâll get creative and connect some thoughts up, sooner or later.
But sometimes my brain feels too jumpy.
I get distracted by my own thoughts when I really want to listen to other people.
"Slow processing speed means that it can be hard in the moment to process what youâre thinking, let alone to communicate it effectively to someone else.
Add to that an unreliable short-term memory and it can look to others like you arenât trying your best sometimes, even though you are.
It feels frustrating.
But then dyslexic individuals often develop good interpersonal skills to compensate for their weaknesses.
They understand what it is like for things not to come easily, and develop empathy, patience and resilience.
In this way dyslexia affects not only how you think, but who you are.â
Laura, Marketing Manager
There are many opportunities to work with children with disabilities and special educational needs in schools.
You don't need a degree to work with people with disabilities and special educational needs; however, they will open doors for you and equip you with a toolbox of skills that you can apply to many different situations and settings.
For example, BA (Hons) Special Educational Needs & Disability Studies dives deep into the issues explored in this article as well, ensuring you gain real-world experience through work placements.
While PGCE Primary Education with Special Educational Needs and Disability qualifies you as a primary school teacher and enables you to specialise in supporting students with additional learning requirements.
A SENDCO (sometimes also known as a SENCO) is responsible for supporting pupils with special educational needs and disability (SEND).
They are aware of the policy, liaise with the headteacher and other colleagues, secure funding, design and deliver interventions for students, and may well have classroom teaching responsibilities.
It's an exciting role that advocates for pupils with SEND and makes a difference to individuals and the nature of the school environment.
You need to be a qualified teacher to work as SENDCO.
In England, Wales and Northern Island, you will need an additional qualification called National Award for Special Educational Needs Coordination that typically can be obtained alongside working your job.
You will be required to get this within three years of taking your first SENDCO role.
Another qualification you may need is the Early Years SENCO award , which is customised towards the needs of Early Years settings.
It's possible to work as an Assistant SENDCO without being a qualified teacher.
"I wouldn't have become an Assistant SENDCO without completing my degree.
It's given me a much better understanding of special educational needs and disabilities.
I've understood the fundamental principles and ethics behind working with people with SEND and the policies and politics of education.
"After getting an Assistant SENDCO job, I and the lead SENDCO successfully applied for Â£5000 funding to improve the school's facilities for young people with autism.
"As an Assistant SENDCO every day is different, I might be supporting students getting to their lessons if they are feeling too anxious, liaising with parents and teachers, putting in referrals to targeted services, running the 'time out space' for students who are struggling to regulate, or I might be putting in sensory breaks for students - it's a really varied and rewarding role.
Seeing students achieve things that they are proud of is the best part of my job.
"I involve the students with their decisions surrounding their targets.
I think that's essential.
It's not just the parents and the teachers deciding these targets; the students need to have ownership to know what they are working towards."
Chantelle McCarthy, Assistant SENDCO at Eggbuckland Community College
Happily, the conversation around disability, whether it's visible or not, is changing.
Many charities and organisations shift people's views, raise awareness, and seek to end the stigma.
Working with people with disabilities and special educational needs is recognised as a rewarding, varied and meaningful career path.
It is also a growing one.
3.7% of pupils now have an Education, Care and Health (EHC) plan, which sets out the childâs need and the extra help they should receive.
This figure, reported by the Department for Education, is up from 3.3% in 2020, continuing a trend of increases since 2017.
Getting a grounding in the field of special educational needs and disability, through reading, training and real experience, is vital to being able to listen and respond to the needs of disabled people.
The more insight and tools you have, the better equipped you will be to provide real support to your students.
Plymouth Marjon University offers the following courses about special educational needs and disability (SEND):

Many schools advertise teaching jobs for September as soon as Christmas, so you’ll apply for your first teaching job long before you qualify.
To help you feel ready for this, check out these tips from senior teachers and teacher recruiters about how to successfully apply for your first teaching job.
Job searching can be hard work, but there are lots of different ways you can find your dream job in teaching.
There are a variety of places that you can find job advertisements online including Indeed , Teaching Vacancies on Gov.uk , Reed Education , and TES , and local authority websites (for our students here is a link to Plymouth Schools Vacancies ).
School websites and social media may also be a good place to look.
If you know a specific school that you would like to work at this can be a quick way of finding out what positions are currently available.
Often school Facebook or Twitter pages will share adverts, so check on there.
LinkedIn , as well as being a great tool for creating a professional profile, can be a helpful place to find job vacancies.
The platform also allows you to network with other professionals within teaching and make useful links.
It is also important to network whilst on placement.
You may be able to hear about a job through a past colleague or even from the school you have worked at â so make sure to build contacts and make a great impression.
When searching for a job in teaching it can be tempting to apply for every available position within your desired location.
But it is important to not only consider what you can offer prospective employers but what they can offer you.
When starting out in your teaching career, really consider what type of school you want to work in.
It may be helpful to make a list of what criteria you are looking for.
Do you want to work in a small school?
Would you like to work somewhere with a good reputation for supporting sports within the community?
Is it important to you that there is possible career progression?
It may take some time to decide what really is a priority for you when searching for your first teaching job.
Get in touch.
Call the setting you are thinking of applying to work for.
Their response may give you a great indication as to whether it is the place for you.
This is also a great way to make a lasting first impression while gaining an understanding of the school and its principles, expectations and challenges.
It will help to do some research about the school before making this phone call and have questions prepared.
Once you have found a job you want to apply for it is important to know where to start.
Read carefully what your employer wants .
If they ask for a personal statement write one, do not link to a cover letter.
If they have an application form fill that out, do not send in a CV.
A personal statement should be no longer than two sides of A4 .
You want to keep it interesting and engaging.
Make the readers job easy, present yourself in a clear and confident manner.
Really consider what makes you different from other candidates and how this would fit into the school setting you are applying for.
Before you start writing, make sure you know enough about the school to personalise your application .
Never submit a âone size fits allâ personal statement.
Make sure it looks clear and is easy to read .
Avoid handwritten statements and create a smart template that encourages employers to read on.
Messy, unprofessional or difficult to read statements will not be read in full by a time-restricted panel.
There will be two parts to the job advertisement.
The job description and the person specification.
The job description will be relatively general, while the person specification will be a lot more specific.
It will state what the employer is looking for and who their ideal candidate would be.
This is the part of the advert that you need to spend time looking at.
When choosing a candidate, a school panel will mark each applicant against a scoring system.
The applicants with the highest scores will be invited to an interview.
Scores will be based on how much of the person specification criteria are met.
So, it is important that you show how you match what they are looking for when writing your statement.
When writing your statement, it is a good idea to include specific examples of your past experiences.
Back up what you say with evidence.
If they are looking for someone willing to show initiative and explore new ideas, think about a time on work placement when you suggested a new way of looking at a problem - it doesnât have to be anything ground-breaking.
Your opening paragraph needs to demonstrate your skills and passions as a teacher.
Think about the relationships you have built while on placement and the progress you have seen in pupils.
This will be the first thing employers read so donât give a generic introduction that gives little information on what you can bring to a school.
Your first sentence could specifically reference the job and school.
Do not be afraid to tell them where you want your career to go in your application.
Perhaps you want to lead in pastoral care or progress to become a headteacher.
When you share your ambitions with potential employers they gain a greater awareness of who you are and what you have to offer.
You will want your personal statement to be just that â personal.
So, make sure you include information about your ethos, passions and interests and how they will help you when working in the specific school you are looking to apply for.
What are you passionate about?
Why are you different to the other candidates?
How will you fit into the existing school dynamic?
You may also want to write a little bit about your outside interests, but not too much.
You want to indicate that you are a rounded person, and you are not just all about work.
This may allow you to offer extracurricular activities within the school based on these interests.
You want to make our application stand out.
You can link again to how your interests make you a good fit for the school.
Link in the information that you know about setting and personalise it to the specific job.
It is also important that the final paragraph (and more specifically, the final sentence) perfectly sums up why you are the best candidate for the job.
Be confident but not arrogant.
For example, you might start the paragraph by saying what you will bring to the role.
You might choose to close off your statement by saying that you look forward to the interview.
Be specific about what you may wish to discuss at the interview as well.
Again, reference the school specifically in your closing paragraph.
Make sure you read over what you have written and look out for any typos or mistakes.
It would also be helpful to get someone else to read over it.
When you look at something too much you can easily miss something â a fresh pair of eyes may be able to point out something you did not spot.
If you have a gap in your CV e.g.
due to travelling, health reasons or family commitments do address it in your application â either in a specified section or in the chronology.
Keep it simple.
For example, you may write: âCareer break due to health reasonsâ.
In cases like this, it would be especially helpful to get in touch with the school and be open and honest about your experiences.
Make sure that you have checked that the references you have provided will be happy to provide one.
Let them know that you will be using them and check that they are happy with this.
Before sending your application, it is a good idea to print it off.
Check that the format looks okay and make sure that there are not any errors or formatting glitches, such as a random line on a page.
Make sure you send it to the correct department or person.
This might sound obvious but is a common mistake.
Some schools will ask that it is sent directly to the Headteacher, or Chair of Governors whilst others may have an HR representative.
It can be easy to forget when uploading to social media, who may be able to see what you are sharing.
If you have low privacy settings, images, videos and even statusâ you post may appear on Google.
This allows employers to quickly get a first impression of you who are â good or bad.
Unfortunately, many job seekers are caught out by this, often forgetting about content they posted as a teenager on Facebook or YouTube.
Look at what an employer can find out about you.
Check what settings you have on social media and the kind of images and information you share publicly.
Google your name and see what comes up.
Is there anything inappropriate on there?
Would you want students or staff to be able to see what comes up?
If something unprofessional does come up, trace it back to where it was published and see if it can be removed.
If it is a photograph you shared then delete it yourself.
Social media can also work as a positive when searching for your first teaching job.
You could add a link to your LinkedIn profile on your application â this will help employers see who you really are in a professional manner.
This allows you to build a positive online presence in contrast to a negative one.
Finally, make sure that you have a professional email address that you can provide.
You do not want to be sharing an email address that includes a funny, gimmicky or inappropriate name.
Every aspect of your application is telling an employer who you are â so make sure to be professional.
And relax...
Now that the application has been sent, try not to focus too much on whether you will get an interview.
If you are unsuccessful, it may be worth asking for feedback from the school â politely and professionally.
If you are successful, then now is the time to prepare for your first teaching interview.

School leadership is tough.
It can feel lonely and sometimes pressurised.
But it doesn’t have to be like that.
It’s possible for school leaders to come together into communities of practice that help everyone – leaders, teachers, pupils – to thrive.
It is, let us tell you more...
School leadership in many schools can make you feel like you are in it on your own, an individual leader in an individual role, which can make for a lonely and stressful experience.
It can get so that performativity, as in things like examinations, Ofsted inspections, Board or Local Authority expectations, and competition for pupil numbers or resources, create pressure and undermine the possibility of collaboration and exchange with other school leaders.
In many ways, our pupil assessment system is set up to create and re-create this underlying leadership narrative.
With a normal distribution curve for exam results, there is currently an inevitability that some pupils will not pass their exams.
Therefore, not all schools can be above average - not all school leaders can succeed.
While recognising this challenge for school leadership, along with the fact that individual effectiveness in leadership is crucial; there is scope to collaborate with other school leaders to bring about better outcomes for all.
For example you can work together to develop teacher excellence, provide opportunities for your team to flourish and see pupil outcomes rise.
Through the Covid pandemic, we have seen multiple spontaneously catalysed networks erupt through need â no one school has been an expert â all school leaders had experience to offer for the greater good.
â School leadership can feel isolating.
The responsibilities can weigh heavy.
School leaders quite often deflect the challenges of running a school from their staff.
Being part of a community of practice offers school leaders a space to share experiences, expertise and ideas with others who understand completely what the role requires for a school to operate effectively.
Tanya Ovenden-Hope, Professor of Education and Provost of Marjon University Cornwall
So, how can you take this community feeling for school leadership forward?
Leadership development is at its most effective when school leaders are able to journey together, shape one anotherâs thinking and refine practice through implementing the evidence together.
There are very few effective leaders who flourish in their roles without clear networks, relationships, and that sense that one is part of a bigger story through connectedness.
As leaders, we flourish together not alone.
Communities of practice are a great way of bringing leaders together.
In essence, as defined by Wenger, McDermott, & Snyder, 2002, they are: âGroups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis".
Communities of practice for school leadership have the potential to sustain and nourish you as a leader.
They are a community, a collection of individual school leaders, working together for a common purpose.
There is an emphasis on the social aspect of learning, with a focus on three important characteristics: 1.
Domain - this is the topic or theme to be addressed and advanced e.g.
a leadership question.
Community - the members are motivated by a mutual interest in the domain e.g.
school leadership.
Practice - the ideas, tools, expertise, knowledge, and shared resources that serve to move the field of inquiry forward e.g.
national professional qualification (NQP) resources on leadership.
Becoming part of a community of practice will support you in developing yourself and your school and so fuels school improvement, which is at the heart of school leadership.
The experiential knowledge that you have developed as a leader over time, from teacher, to middle leader, to senior leader is incredibly useful to your school and is likely to be just as useful to other leaders in developing their own schools.
Embedding a community of practice in your leadership development journey will enable you to develop new ideas and strategies; it can be transformational.
Andy Wolfe, Executive Director of Education, Church of England explains why: âCommunities of practice have great potential to sustain leaders, through building their sense of connection and shared journey.
They require clear ownership and clarity of thematic focus, expert facilitation, clear logistics and a longer-term commitment to one anotherâs development.
Members of such communities come asking not simply âwhat can I gain?â but crucially, âwhat can I give?'.
They blend instructional and transformational approaches to leadership development, through a sustainable methodology of learning and flourishing together.â
Belonging to a community of practice creates space to stop the bad stuff and get on with the good.
For example, they help you to engage with values dissonance, thatâs when you find your time going into things you do not highly value.
Other leaders can (supportively) challenge how you think about things, enabling you to see them in other, potentially better ways.
This challenging of your thinking potentially opens the way for new practices to emerge and for creativity to flourish.
As you know, thinking differently is often a good thing in leadership, but it can feel risky if you are doing it on your own.
By working together in your community of practice, the benefits of collaboration and innovation can flow.
Your need to be part of a community of practice, or to form one, will emerge from the potential in a current situation.
Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder (2002) set out five stages of communities of practice development and these are useful to know when considering how to put together communities of practice for school leadership:
Potential - The basic elements exist: a social network, an important topic (leadership), perceived value from developing the network (sharing expertise), and the sharing of knowledge (professional learning through peers).
Coalescing - Energy is generated to develop the community, build trust among its members (shared experience on the programme), and identify what knowledge should be shared.
Maturing â The focus, role, and boundaries are clarified and gaps in knowledge may become more apparent as it expands.
Stewardship - The focus is on action and maintaining momentum, sometimes by adding new members and/or by working to keep the community's practice on the cutting edge.
Transformation - Communities of practice depend on the commitment and passion of their members, so a point may arrive where a community's work is done.
It may rest and revive when a new issue emerges to stimulate participation, such as policy change requiring a collective response.
It may split into new communities or merge with others (such as a community of practice for school leaders within a MAT, Local Authority or region).
The National Professional Qualifications in Leadership (NPQL) can act as a foundation for all these stages.
These are Department of Education accredited qualifications for aspiring and serving Headteachers and Chief Executive Officers of multi-academy trusts.
They are designed to support professional development to help school leaders and teachers become more effective.
âBy embedding communities of practice in all of our Church of England NPQ programmes, participants are not simply gaining knowledge and completing the courses â rather they are being grounded, encouraged, supported and challenged by these sustainable communities, characterised by robust peer challenge and debate and with the potential to enhance wellbeing and resilience long after the completion of the programme itself.â
Andy Wolfe, Executive Director of Education, Church of England
As a school leader you would engage with your community of practice to improve your school leadership potential.
Together youâll develop your learning together through a range of activities that include:
Communities of practices are a useful mechanism within formal leadership programmes, such as the NPQs, to advance leadership development.
They can also be informal groupings of school leaders too.
Our flourishing as leaders need not be an individual pursuit, but should rather be a journey we take together, even when on a formal leadership development programme.
School leaders get stronger when they seek out and develop communities of practice, this ensures that your lived reality is one of flourishing with others, not standing alone.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/how-to-get-into-teaching/how-to-get-into-primary-teaching-without-a-degree:
If you don’t yet have a degree then there are various routes open to you to become a qualified primary teacher.
The best one for you depends on your personal circumstances as well as how certain you are that you want to teach.
To teach in maintained schools in the UK youâll need Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and a degree at 2:2.
Maintained schools are state schools overseen by the local authority, they are the majority of all schools.
There are lots of routes to earning a degree and QTS and we're about to explore them.
But first, what even is QTS?
Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is a professional qualification for teachers.
It is required to teach in state-run primary, secondary, and special schools.
You need QTS if you want to qualify for the qualified teacher pay scale, which in turn enables you to join the Teachersâ Pension Scheme.
QTS is required for most teacher roles and leadership opportunities within UK schools.
It is possible to teach in private schools, free schools and some academies without QTS, but not having it massively limits your career options.
There are a couple of pre-requisites to getting on to any undergraduate course that awards QTS.
You must have level 4 or grade C or above in GCSE Maths and English, and GCSE Science for primary teaching.
Broadly speaking there are two routes to QTS:
An undergraduate teacher training degree that awards QTS
Any undergraduate degree followed by a one-year teacher training degree that awards QTS
To get on to a course with QTS youâll also need school experience, which means youâve spent time observing and helping with lessons in a school, and a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.
An undergraduate degree with QTS is the quickest way to qualify as a teacher.
It takes three years of full-time study.
But this route isnât for everyone.
It may be that you canât afford to be a full-time student for three years, or maybe you donât meet the entry requirements.
But fear not, there are plenty of other routes into primary teaching.
The other route is to choose an undergraduate course without QTS then do a one-year postgraduate teacher training course that awards QTS.
That route usually equals four years of studying.
For completeness, weâll add that Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) is available to teachers in the Further Education and Post-Compulsory Education sectors (i.e.
teaching from age 14 up to adults).
It is recognised as equivalent to QTS and there is no need to hold both awards.
QTS is awarded with some but not all Bachelor of Education (BEd), Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) courses.
Always check with the provider as to whether or not QTS is included.
Degrees with QTS offer the fastest route to becoming a qualified teacher, typically taking three years.
Degrees with QTS combine study at university with placement blocks where youâll develop practical skills.
In university youâll explore approaches to things like assessment, child development, classroom management, learning, marking, planning, subject knowledge, and teaching.
Itâs on placement that you get to put what youâve learned into practice.
Youâll need to spend at least 120 days in at least two schools to earn QTS.
School placements are typically longer on QTS than non-QTS courses and youâll be required to teach and given full support to do so.
Youâll gradually build your confidence and expertise in leading a class too, learning about things like special educational needs and disabilities, behaviour management, identifying pupil progress, planning, child development and learning through play.
At the end of three years, youâll be ready and qualified to teach in a primary school.
If you are very confident that you want to teach, then a course with QTS is perfect for you.
Youâll develop deep knowledge of the skills and subject knowledge required to teach all the National Curriculum subjects and youâll have the chance to specialise in the subjects that most interest you.
Molly King, a graduate of BEd Primary Education with QTS , explains how placement learning works:
The great thing is that there are loads of non QTS courses to choose from.
You start with a three-year undergraduate degree and follow it with a one-year qualification to earn QTS such as Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) or School Direct .
Studying for an undergraduate degree doesnât have to mean spending three years full-time at university.
Some degrees are designed so that you can study while you work.
Chris Simpson, a Senior Lecturer in Education at Plymouth Marjon University, explains how this works: âSome degrees are designed for people who are working.
It enables you to remain in your work with children.
Youâll learn to connect the theoretical concepts that are taught in university, and the reading you do, to your day-to-day work.
For people with teaching assistant experience it can be like lighting the blue touch paper because they already know a lot of this stuff, but they don't know they know it, and they don't know why it works, and they don't yet know what language to use to explain what's happening.
Itâs exciting and it opens doors in their careers.
âYou earn while you learn.
For example on the FdA Learning and Teaching you attend university for 20 days per year and must work alongside this in a relevant role in education, whether paid or voluntary, for a minimum of 10 hours per week.
After two years you can graduate with a foundation degree and then top it up to an honours degree by joining the third year of an education degreeâ.
Itâs worth noting that while you can do any undergraduate course, doing an education course makes you a strong candidate when you come to apply for PGCE Primary or School Direct.
For a full-time university experience BA (Hons) Primary Education is a great option, but when it comes to non-QTS courses there are many options.
You can pick any branch of education that excites you and develop the specialist knowledge and skills that can help in in teaching or other careers.
For example, if you are drawn to working with very young children check out BA Early Childhood Studies, if youâre never happier than when out in the great outdoors then try BA (Hons) Outdoor Adventure Education , if youâre drawn to empowering disabled children see BA (Hons) Special Educational Needs and Disability Studies , or if sport is totally your thing try BA (Hons) Physical Education or BA Sports Coaching and Physical Education .
Miles Smith, course leader of BA (Hons) Primary Education, explains more: âMy students come from all walks of life.
Some donât have the standard entry requirements for teaching but have taught in some way.
They tend to come with convincing personal statements, real-world school experience, and recommendations from Headteachers.
By the end of the BA, they have the extra knowledge they need to get taken on as a trainee teacher and go on to become great teachers.
Other students want to keep their options open.
They are interested in child development and education as well as teaching and BA Primary Education is broad enough to cover all those things.â
After a non-QTS course you'll need a minimum of a 2:2 for your undergraduate degree to get on to a postgraduate teacher training course.
You donât have to study at the same university for your undergraduate and postgraduate courses, though you might choose to.
BA Primary Education graduate Shannon Angwin tells us about her experience:
To recap, you need Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) to become a fully qualified teacher and weâve looked at the main differences between undergraduate education courses with and without QTS.
So now for the million-dollar question: Which route into teaching is right for you?
Let's look at some things to consider...
QTS courses are typically full-time.
You can study for some non-QTS courses full-time or part-time which may offer more flexibility around family or work commitments.
If you take a non-QTS undergraduate degree, youâll need to follow it with a postgraduate teacher training course to earn your QTS.
This bit will be a full-time course and most trainees say itâs challenging but very rewarding.
On a related note, undergraduate courses with QTS courses tend to have more hours of lecturers, practicals and independent study.
Non-QTS courses can be a better fit if you have other time commitments.
Some non-QTS education courses are flexible enough for you to keep working in education if you already have a job.
You will find that different courses charge different course fees so cost out your various routes to QTS as this could save you thousands.
Check the provider websites for full details.
You are also eligible to apply for Student Finance to cover your tuition fees and living costs when you take any undergraduate degree, and again if you go on to PGCE and School Direct courses.
Rarely are government bursaries available for primary trainees, but there are more options for secondary trainees.
Bursaries change every year depending on the skills most needed at the time.
On degrees with QTS youâll always be required to teach on placements, whereas with non-QTS teaching on placements isnât essential.
You can opt whether to teach or not.
Also, non-QTS courses keep your options open, they are great not just for progressing to teacher training but also to other careers in education, or to Masterâs and then PhD level study.
Having no degree today doesnât stop you becoming a teacher in the future.
Loads of great teachers come to it that bit later in life, as a career change or after a career break.
That extra bit of life experience can really add to what you are able to do in the classroom.

New sentences found on https://marjon.ac.uk/professional-development-for-teachers/child-mental-health-theories:
In recent years there has been an unprecedented rise in the number of children and young people with mental health issues, accelerating further in the wake of Covid-19.
This result is a challenging situation for schools, but one in which teachers are in a prime position to make a difference.
Weâre going to outline some of the key theories that relate to mental health and apply them to school settings, to help teachers better understand the child mental health situations they see.
Weâll start with a quick look at what we mean when we talk about mental health.
Being mentally healthy means being productive, having fulfilling relationships, being able to adapt to change and cope with adversity.
Itâs not about being happy or sad, itâs about being able to cope with everyday life.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
It affects how we think, feel, and act.
It goes a long way to determining how we handle stress, interact with others, and make choices.
For some children, the stresses they face can sadly cause mental health issues such as anxiety, eating disorders, depression, or self-harm.
There is no clear reason why some children develop mental health issues while others donât but being exposed to traumatic experiences can make it more likely.
These experiences might include abuse, bullying, death of a loved one, family breaking up, long-term illness, moving home, poverty or violence in the home.
Mental health conditions and trauma act as a barrier to learning.
Teachers who understand even basic mental health theory and practice can help to support their students.
Indeed, some schools are now âtrauma-informed schoolsâ, which means they train teachers and other staff to recognise and respond to mental health conditions and trauma in children and young people.
It is not what a child does that matters, but why they do it.
Each child is an individual, so to support them, you need to get to know them.
Carina Robertson, who lectures in psychology at Plymouth Marjon University explains: âThe key thing to remember when focusing on a childâs mental health is that everything you do needs to be child-centred.
The child is behaving this way for a reason.
You want to look beyond what the child does and figure out why theyâre doing it.
Once you understand why they are behaving as they are, you can then approach the behaviour in a compassionate way and not exacerbate the childâs difficult feelings.â
In trying to establish why a child is behaving in a certain way, the smallest of things can be a signal.
For example, say a child arrives 10 minutes late and wearing the wrong socks; if this is unusual for them, speak to them gently, asking what has been going on this morning?
If they are stressed, then reminding them of the schoolâs attendance and uniform policies might make things feel worse for the child, especially if things are amiss for reasons outside of their control.
Always take a moment to understand why things are as they are.
You might like to find out more about how to support children with mental health conditions .
But now back to the theoryâ¦
Attachment theory explains how a child interacts with the adults looking after them.
It describes how the parent-child relationship emerges and influences the childâs subsequent development.
If a child has a healthy attachment this means the child is confident that the adults in their life will respond to their needs, for example when they are hungry, tired, or worried.
In turn, this gives the child confidence, a secure foundation from which to explore the world, and a good sense of self-esteem.
Healthy attachment helps the child grow up to be a happy and functioning adult, better able to manage their own feelings and better able to relate to others.
Conversely, if a child canât rely on their carers to look after them because they are inconsistent, insensitive, or unreliable, then that has damaging consequences for the adult that child will become.
For example, the child may become very anxious when they canât predict how the adults around them will act; or theyâll give up trying to get their basic needs met because they have too often been ignored.
Their development may be delayed in terms of learning, emotional regulation, and self-control.
Some of the things youâre already doing in your teaching practice, like providing a structured environment and keeping calm and consistent, are especially supportive of attachment disordered children.
You help them too by maintaining your professional boundaries - being their teacher, not their friend.
If you can develop a trusting relationship with the child, this will help them even when they move on from your class; as theyâll feel more confident about doing it again.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a motivational theory in psychology, it suggests that before individuals can meet their full potential, they need to satisfy a series of needs.
The needs lower down in the hierarchy must be met before they can satisfy the higher levels of need.
It reminds us that students are less able to perform to their full potential if their basic needs are not being met.
At the base of the hierarchy are physiological needs , these include fresh air, food, water, sleep, and warmth.
If the student has these needs met, then next are their safety needs , they need to feel safe and secure at home, in school and wherever else they go.
The third need is love and belonging â this is all about a sense of belonging to a group and building strong relationships.
Then comes esteem , this is the need to feel good about yourself which in school relates to things like whether they are respected by their classmates, and what feedback and praise they are getting from their teachers.
Maslow's fifth and final stage is self-actualization .
This is about realising their full potential, feeling self-fulfilled and pursuing personal growth, or as Maslow himself put it way back in 1943, they have âthe desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can beâ.
Breaking the hierarchy down into the five steps is a helpful way of thinking about whether all the childâs needs are being met in the classroom.
For example, starting out with physiological needs might include things like providing all students with access to water or to healthy snacks to maintain their concentration and energy.
It could also include providing a nap room or rest space for overtired students, or ensuring they have coats, sun cream, welly boots, or whatever they need for the climate.
In terms of safety, we might look at bullying, and for love and belonging, we can look at helping the child to build friendships, consider our relationship (student-teacher) or the ways in which we do group work.
Moving on to esteem, are we regularly giving them positive feedback?
Are their peers doing the same?
Does the child have an encouraging and realistic view of their own strengths?
And finally, in terms of self-actualisation, are you setting the expectation that students always perform at their best but without overly pressuring them so that this turns into stress.
Ask the child how itâs going and let their feedback guide you.
Back to Carina Robertson to introduce us to a concept known as âflipping the lidâ: âFlipping the lid helps us to visualise, at a very simple level, what happens in the brain when emotions explode.
Think of the calm brain as a clenched fist.
When emotions take over the fingers of the âhand brainâ flip up.
This represents the child being triggered and when this happens their central cortex, thatâs the bit which runs the higher brain functions, disconnects from the other parts of the brain.
The result is that the emotional parts of the brain (the amygdala) are left running the showâ.
For more info see this talk on the flipping the lid concept by its originator, Dr Dan Siegel.
Itâs not that emotional reactions are a bad thing, not at all.
Anxiety and fear are natural and necessary emotions.
They are experienced by everyone and are helpful in protecting us in the face of danger.
But they become unhelpful if they are triggered when there is no danger, for example by an internal thought or by the external situation.
For example, anxiety may be activated when a student is called to speak in class, told off by teachers, or in conflict with other children.
Carina explains why teachers can use humour to connect with an anxious child: âUsing humour to help a child to regulate their anxiety is one of the most powerful tools in a teacherâs repertoire.
Humour activates the brainâs dopamine reward system, and dopamine is known as the feelgood chemical because it does amazing things like reduce anxiety, fear, and sadness, and increase energy and self-esteemâ.
Think back to the example above about the child with the wrong socks.
The teacher could use humour to explore the situation in a sensitive way, saying something like: âI notice you've got odd socks on.
What's going on here?
Did you forget to put the lights on this morning?â.
Now in itself, the act of wearing the wrong socks doesnât matter.
But if you think something more serious is happening then using humour to explore the seemingly small things may give you new insights into what is going on in the childâs life.
PACE is a way of thinking and communicating that aims to make the child feel safe.
Put forward by Golding and Hughes in 2012, PACE stands for Playfulness, Acceptance, Empathy and Curiosity .
It was inspired by the ways parents connect with very young children.
PACE helps adults to slow down their reactions, tune into what the child or young person is experiencing in the moment and guide them through their heightened emotions and thoughts.
It also helps develop a sense of connectedness and understanding between the child and the adult.
You want to create a light and playful atmosphere and use a light tone of voice.
This could be through activities that involve both the child and the adult.
This is what playfulness might sound like: âGosh, look at the paints Joe, it looks like Nibbles (the class hamster) has been running around the table knocking them all over.
Are you OK?
You look really sad.
Why donât we see what we can do about it.â
Accept that whatever the child (or you) is feeling right now is OK.
Show you understand, say something like: âIâm sorry you think X, that must feel awful, no wonder you did Yâ.
You can still tell a student to stop bad behaviour, whilst showing an understanding of it.
This is what acceptance might sound like: âOh Joe, it feels annoying when things go wrong like your picture getting ripped everywhere, doesnât it?
I get so upset when my work gets spoiled.â
Ask lots of questions of them to know more about them.
What do you think that was about?â or âI wonder whatâ¦?
This way you can avoid jumping to inaccurate conclusions.
This is what curiosity might sound like: âHey Joe, your art is usually so amazing, what happened today?
Is there something distracting you from your work today, is your mum poorly again or are you feeling upset about something?â
Put yourself in the childâs shoes and try to feel what they must be feeling.
Being empathic is not about reassuring the child, simply being with them in the moment and helping them to carry their big emotions.
Show that you know this is difficult for them and they are not alone.
This is what empathy might sound like:âOh Joe, you got angry while you were painting.
You looked really annoyed, it doesnât feel good when weâre cross, sometimes you donât want to shout but it just comes out.
Letâs have a think together about what might be better for you to do".
All the theories discussed here have one thing in common; they encourage the adult to try to understand the childâs distress.
They arenât about saying âdonât worryâ or rushing into âfixingâ things.
It can be challenging as an adult to stay calm when a child is not, thatâs very human.
In those moments Carinaâs top tip is to: âTake a deep breath and remind yourself that what youâre seeing is the child's defence mechanism.
You might think itâs you, but itâs not.
Always go back to the why.
Why is the child behaving this way?
It may not be easy right now but know that you can help them and you can make a differenceâ.

Being able to demonstrate full engagement with your degree programme be that a placement, volunteering or studying for a semester abroad  helps you to evidence skills and experience that are in high demand from employers.
Our Student Ambassadors play a key role at events such as open days, applicant days, marketing events and higher education fairs as well as helping out with many office-based tasks.
It is a great way to learn new skills, meet new people and increase your confidence and youâll earn some money.
Is there a sport you love?
Do you want to try something new?
Our students say they benefit from fitness, coaching and great friendships when they join our sport clubs.
The following student sport clubs are currently available: Adventure Sports, American Flag,  Menâs Basketball, Dance, Menâs and Womenâs Football, Menâs and Womenâs Futsal, Menâs and Womenâs Hockey, Menâs and Womenâs Lacrosse, Netball, Menâs and Womenâs Rugby, Menâs Tennis, Menâs and Womenâs Volleyball, Swimming and Womenâs Waterpolo.

Joining a society enables you doing something that feels worthwhile, fulfilling and meaningful to you.
In a survey of 55 students who participated in clubs and societies 95% of students stated that they had developed new skills and 90% experienced personal growth (Preedy, 2017).
Students who participate in extra-curricular activity at university (sport, societies, volunteering) are more likely to gain graduate level employment.
These graduates are more likely to be happier, command higher salaries and be more positive about their prospects.
If we don't have the society you want then Marjon Student Union will help you to get it started.
Student Representatives are the voice of students at Plymouth Marjon University.
They are elected/volunteer at the start of the academic year to represent their course mates at Staff Student Liaison Committees (SSLCs) and the Student Experience Council (SEC).
They are therefore expected to attend SSLCs for their programmes, as well as attending SEC as often as possible.
Within SSLCs an issue relating to their course can be raised.
If this is unable to be resolved at an SSLC or needs further action, the Student Reps can raise it at SEC.
The role of the Student Rep is a highly rewarding one.
You will make a real difference to the student experience by discussing and influencing important decisions and changes at the University.
As well as being a great addition to your CV, acting as a Student Representative will stand you in good stead for your future career when you may have to participate in your employerâs meetings, or even organise and run your own meetings!
The student social media team are a fabulous bunch of creative and social-savvy students who create content to showcase the best of the University.
They can get involved with presenting, blogging, story-telling, reporting, image and/or video work across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.
Itâs paid work and a great start for those pursuing creative and digital careers.
Placement Learning is different from work experience; it is a planned period of learning, normally outside of the University and the learning outcomes are part of the student’s degree studies.
Credit is not awarded for undertaking work, but for the skills demonstrated as a result of the experience.
According to our Placements Co-ordinator: “Research shows that employers are more likely to employ graduates who have relevant placement experience.
It has also shown that students who undertake placements improve their academic performance, because students become more involved with the learning process and, therefore, better motivated”.
In a placement, you’re showing future employers that you’re capable of taking on professional responsibilities and that you’re serious about your future career.
Placements also help you to make valuable links within your industry: links which could lead to employment down the line.
For further information contact our Placement Team on Placements@marjon.ac.uk

Thank you for your interest in becoming a homestay provider for Marjon’s international short stay courses.
We recognise that the service our homestay families provide is an important factor in ensuring that our students feel welcome and safe.
Hello

Iâm David Lovell and I am the Project Lead for Naval Related Programmes at Plymouth Marjon University.
At Marjon we run a training programme for Naval Officers, specifically from Oman in the Middle East, designed to prepare young officers for further Naval training both within the UK, at BRNC Dartmouth and in Oman.
The programme consists of three main modules, namely English, personal fitness and maritime subjects.
An important element in this training is the cultural, social and environmental experience that the students enjoy whilst at Marjon.
The Omani Military are particularly keen that the students experience and witness the family life of a British household and to that end we have, for many years, partnered with local host families who accommodate and integrate these young men into their household for the duration of their time in Plymouth.
For many of these young people it is the first time they have been away from home and visited a different country.
Their average age is between 19-22 and all have a good understanding of spoken English.
What are we looking for?
: 
families to welcome guests into their homes to experience life in a UK household
to eat together, join in discussions, listen to each other 
to understand that safety and security are a priority
to include the guest in family life 
conversations, family outings, activities, the day to day things that families get up to
to have fun in a comfortable and welcoming environment
What are the benefits for those who might be interested in participating in homestay?:
the opportunity to learn about another culture
meet interesting and engaging people
to share stories and experiences
to expand their horizons
to help others new to the UK to acclimatise 
to allow others to experience life in a UK household
to build life-long friendships
to offer insights, viewpoints and knowledge on the local area, it's culture and community
gain satisfaction and a sense of pride from helping others and providing a welcoming, comfortable and inclusive environment
to earn additional income

If hosting a student in your home is something that might be of interest to you then  please get in touch with Maddy Hopson on Plymouth 01752 636711 or e-mail mhopson@marjon.ac.uk

Ever thought about becoming an officer for the Student Union?
Nominations will shortly be open for MSU Elections 2025.
Each year, the students at Marjon elect people to represent them and run the union on their behalf.
These people are usually known as sabbatical or part time officers and they fulfill a number of vital roles.
We want you to stand to be one!
Union officers are responsible for the work and direction of the students’ union.
As a team, they identify what students want and look at ways in which these needs can be met.
Executive officers will work on projects together; involve students in the projects and co-ordinate the delivery of the project.
Previous projects will have included running campaigns, arranging events, setting up a training programme, organising activities … the list is endless.
The key thing is that you do not have to work on your own.
Working within a team means that you can plan your time and the tasks that you take on, and you only need to take on what you feel that you can manage.
The benefits to you are immense.
You may also get to attend conferences and meetings with other students’ unions, who may be carrying out similar projects.
Crucially, you will be able to demonstrate in the future that you have initiated and implemented a manifesto (a public declaration of what you want to achieve), as well as showing that you are motivated and willing to take responsibility.
We want to make it as easy as possible for you to stand in our elections.
Gone are the days of "jobs for the boys" when people just got their friends voted in - these days we aim to get plenty of candidates standing so the electorate has a clear choice in who runs their union.
Think about it – and if you want to talk about it then please contact Mick Davies who can talk to you about the range of positions available.

Marjon Student Union is an organisation run for and by the student population of Plymouth Marjon University.
Student Unions are a unique chance for students to lead their own services and to help support and represent themselves throughout their educational careers.
Students are a key market for many brands, not least because they have an average annual spending power of £10 billion comprising mostly disposable income.
At university, students are also in the process of developing brand associations and many are making their own purchasing decisions for the first time, creating a key opportunity for businesses to capture the market.
Plymouth Marjon University has approximately 3,000 students in full and part-time courses and the Student Union is the hub and gateway to all aspects of student life.
We have over 1,000 registered students who have signed up for emails, and our Facebook user groups are interlinked to promote and advertise information to our students.
This puts us in the unique position of providing our clients with a direct and hassle-free media placement service, allowing them to reach this lucrative market.
To discuss marketing opportunities with the Marjon Student Union, contact Kevin Traynor at ktraynor@marjon.ac.uk.

They operate on a first come, first serve basis and are intended to be short (10-15 mins) appointments for students with a quick query.
Longer appointments can be arranged by email (details below).
Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSA) are grants that are available for UK students who have a disability, long-term health condition, mental health condition or a SpLD (e.g.
dyslexia).
DSA can help towards the extra costs you may have on your course and pay for additional support, such as Specialist Equipment, Specialist Mentoring or Study Skills, Travel and General costs (e.g.
printing and ink).
The type of support and how much you get depends on your individual needs - not your household income.
Undergraduate students can apply online, through their funding body (for most UK students this will be Student Finance England).
You will need to supply supporting documentation that confirms any diagnosis/es or symptoms.
E.g.
a letter from your GP or a copy of your diagnostic assessment report from an Educational Psychologist if you are dyslexic.
If you don’t already have appropriate documentation to support your DSA application, Student Finance England (SFE) have produced a medical evidence form (link below) that you can take to your GP or a relevant healthcare professional to complete.
All part-time and Postgraduate students need to apply for DSA each year of study by completing a DSA1 form (link below).
You will also need to supply supporting documentation.
The DSA process can take up to 12 weeks, so we strongly recommend applying as early as possible so that any support awarded can be put into place ahead of you starting your course.

We know that not everyone who accesses our service thinks of themselves as disabled, but we use the term because it is used in the Equality Act.
In the Equality Act, a disability means a physical or a mental health condition which has a substantial and long-term impact on your ability to do normal day-to-day activities.
We strongly encourage students to disclose any disabilities or medical conditions so that we can consider any reasonable adjustments that will support you during your time at university.
This might cover anything from extra time for exams to adjustable desks.
We would encourage you to disclose as early as possible but you can do this at anytime during your course.
If you have already disclosed, and have a newly diagnosed or an additional condition, please let us know, so that we can review and adjust your support as required.
Please be reassured that any data shared with us is treated as sensitive data under the Data Protection Act.

Marjon Counselling Service for students.
What you might like to know...
We recognise that at times in our life things can feel tough for whatever reasons there might be and sometimes we don’t know why we feel the way we do.
This can leave us feeling confused, alone and not sure what could happen next.
Perhaps the following might help you look at how we can help support you.
You will find our Counselling Centre in the east block of the Quad (grass area) between the Octagon and Barjon.
You are very welcome to pop in and have a look inside, even if you don’t want to see or talk to anybody, perhaps just knowing we are here will help.
We thought there might be lots of questions you want to ask and we hope that some of them might be answered here.
How will I know I need or want counselling?
We can offer you an initial appointment to discuss your thoughts and feelings to help you make decisions over your wellbeing.
Counselling may be suggested by your GP, a member of staff at Marjon, or your family and friends.
It is very much your choice to have counselling and to make that choice of when and if you feel you want to access support.
How do I find out about the counselling service?
You are very welcome to get in touch and make a self-referral through our Counselling email – counselling@marjon.ac.uk or ring us and leave a message – 01752 636850 .
We aim to answer your request within 5 working days and to offer you an initial appointment within 10 days.
We can arrange an initial appointment with you to tell you more about our service.
This is also an opportunity for you to find out more and to ask questions and for us to find out more about you and how you have been feeling.
Importantly, it can be a time for you to make the choice of whether counselling feels right for you.
Our initial appointments are usually for 30 minutes and will be with one of our friendly counsellors.
Can I get counselling right away?
We can be a busy service which sometimes creates a waiting list.
The length of the waiting time depends on the demand on our service, and the time of the year.
You may be put on our waiting list for counselling until a session becomes available for you.
Please know we have additional members of the Student Wellbeing and Support Team that can support you too.
We can talk more about your wellbeing during your initial appointment, but if you feel you are in crisis, we may encourage you to link with your GP, as well as look at other areas of support available for you.
What do you offer for counselling?
We offer short term counselling up to 7 sessions with one of our qualified counsellors.
We can offer counselling face to face, telephone or online sessions through TEAMs.
Your sessions will be offered weekly and last for up to 50 minutes.
We try to match a time to fit in with your timetable and your commitments.
Although we are unable to offer long term counselling, you can access our service throughout your time as a student here at Marjon.
This means you can come in and out of our service as and when you need it.
What if I don’t feel counselling is right for me?
Counselling is very much your choice, and there is no expectation for you to have all 7 sessions.
You may feel one or a few sessions are enough, or that counselling doesn’t feel right for you.
We would encourage you to discuss this with your counsellor.
What hours are you open?
We open Monday to Thursday, 9:30 – 5:00 every day except Fridays when we close at 3pm.
Things our counsellors hear that might make people doubt they should go to counselling… “I feel I’m a burden if I talk about my problems and how I’m feeling” “My problem is not as big as others” “Other people deserve more help than me” “I need to be able to deal with my problems and get on with them” “I feel embarrassed to say I need help” We wouldn’t want anyone to think their problem is too small, or that they aren’t entitled to ask for support.
We want everyone to have the opportunity to come and talk about what is going on for them.

Connecting you to funding
The Turing Scheme is the UK government’s programme to provide funding forâ¯international opportunities in education and training across the world.
Plymouth Marjon University has been successful in its application for Turing funding for 25-26 to help students broaden horizons though our international partnerships to enhance employability skills inspired by our core values, Independence, Humanity Curiosity and Ambition.
At Marjon we recognise the importance of the overall experience which equips students with an array of transferable skills that grows confidence to achieve, but we appreciate it’s not always possible for students to apply for such opportunities due to financial circumstances.
However, Turing funding also assists students that meet one or more of the listed disadvantaged criteria, as well as financial support with additional costs such as passport, visa, and health insurance, as required.
Each student circumstances can be different therefore monetory amounts vary accordingly.
However if any students fit into any of the criteria below, then there is additional funding available.
- Students with an annual household income of £25,000 or less - Students receiving Universal Credit or income related benefits - Care leavers and students who are care experienced - Students who have caring responsibilities - Estranged students - Refugees and asylum seekers
Marjon currently partners with Camp America, Challenger Sport, Hanoi University Science & Technology (HUST) and Australian College of Physical Education (ACPE), Catalyst, Berlin and St John University, NYC.

Students can apply for up to £250 for UK based opportunities and up to £400 for international opportunities.
The MEGA Bursary will only fund 60% of the total cost incurred to complete the activity; to a maximum of £250 (UK opportunities) and £400 (international opportunities).

Moving into a place of your own can be very exciting.
After all, there is nothing quite like getting the keys to your first house.
But taking the leap into private renting is a big deal.
Follow this advice and you will increase your odds of having a positive experience.
Plymouth has many student accommodation providers, so do some research on what's out there and ask other students about their experiences.
Choosing where to move is particularly important as the location of your new home will effect your whole life.
Also, depending on who you’re moving in with, what your requirements are, and how flexible you are willing to be, there might not be much choice.
Most student houses are rather basic, with very variable room sizes and minimal furnishings – so compromise and keeping an open mind is important.
That being said, always shop around and probably don't sign a contract for the first thing you see.
To ensure your property makes the grade look for the ANUK Accreditation for purpose built student accommodation or a HMO license for house shares.
Give yourself time to decide if you are going to share, and who with, before you start looking.
Private accommodation isn’t as flexible as student halls and you cannot up and leave if your living situation no longer suits you or you have a falling out with someone.
Also, unlike in University run halls, your landlord cannot and will not mediate personal disputes.
Try to move in with people you know you will get along with, ideally with similar routines and tolerance levels.
As a minimum:
Your room must be furnished as a bedroom/study.
It should include:
If possible rent a house with a lounge/communal area, it will improve your time in the property enormously.

Released: 04.12.24
Plymouth Marjon University is pleased to announce the appointment of Professor Debby Cotton, Dean of Research and Knowledge Exchange, to the pilot panel for Unit of Assessment 7 – Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences, in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) People, Culture and Environment (PCE) pilot.
This prestigious role marks an important step in the evolving process of shaping the future of research excellence assessment in the UK.
The REF is a vital part of the UK’s higher education landscape, used to assess the quality of research in UK universities.
It plays a key role in determining the allocation of around £2 billion annually in public research funding.
As the REF system evolves, the introduction of the PCE pilot is a groundbreaking initiative designed to expand the definition of research excellence by focusing on the role of people, culture, and the environment in fostering high-quality research across the UK.
The PCE pilot launched in 2024 and aims to develop new criteria for assessing research outputs and impacts, as well as the broader research environment including how universities support and foster diverse research communities.
The exercise will involve 40 higher education institutions, with submissions being assessed across a range of REF assessments.
Professor Cotton’s involvement, which focuses on Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences, highlights the growing recognition of environmental science’s importance in shaping both the future of research and sustainability.
The PCE pilot panel’s work will feed into the development of REF 2029, which is set to offer an enhanced understanding of what constitutes research excellence in the 21st century.
This will be crucial for the ongoing development of policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in research across the UK’s academic institutions.
Professor Debby Cotton brings a wealth of experience to the panel, with an extensive background in environmental science and sustainability research.
She is a leading interdisciplinary researcher and has published work on widening participation and inclusivity in research environments.
Her role in the REF’s Teaching Excellence Framework also brings a unique perspective on the relationship between research and teaching excellence, making her an invaluable addition to the PCE pilot panel.
“I am honoured to contribute to this important initiative,” said Professor Cotton “The REF pilot represents an exciting opportunity to shape how we recognise and support diverse types of research, researchers and institutions across the UK.
I am proud to be representing Marjon on this panel.” Professor Cotton’s appointment aligns with Plymouth Marjon University’s strategic priorities, which include promoting interdisciplinary research, enhancing sustainability, and building inclusive, dynamic research environments that contribute to the wellbeing of society and the planet.
Marjon’s commitment to shaping a sustainable future through research is reflected in Professor Cotton’s work and also in the University’s broader research agenda, which supports innovative, interdisciplinary projects that address pressing global challenges.
As part of the PCE pilot, the insights and feedback from this round of assessments will inform the development of REF 2029, ensuring that the UK’s research evaluation framework is not only robust but also forward-thinking and inclusive of diverse contributions to the research ecosystem.
The pilot is a vital part of the REF 2029 process, and the lessons learned will play an essential role in shaping the next phase of UK higher education research.
As universities like Plymouth Marjon continue to contribute to the global research landscape, the inclusion of diverse voices and the recognition of varied contributions will ensure that the REF reflects the full scope of research excellence.
Professor Cotton will work alongside colleagues from Birmingham, Cardiff, Durham, Surrey, Nottingham, Bristol, Sheffield and more.

Released: 07.05.24
In the landscape of higher education, evaluating the impact of various initiatives can be challenging, especially when dealing with smaller cohorts of students.
Plymouth Marjon University has been at the forefront of addressing this challenge through innovative evaluation methodologies.
One such initiative, the Student Colleague scheme, has been the focus of a ground-breaking project funded by the Centre for Transforming Access and Student Outcomes in Higher Education (TASO) What Works Centre.
The Student Colleague scheme, established in 2019 as part of Plymouth Marjon’s Access and Participation Plan (APP), is designed to provide students with valuable employment experiences while enhancing their employability skills, particularly among under-represented groups in Higher Education.
Recognising the need for robust evaluation methodologies to assess the scheme's outcomes, evaluators embarked on a journey to explore the effectiveness of Transformative Evaluation in this context.
Transformative Evaluation (TE) is a methodology rooted in the Most Significant Change (MSC) technique, harnessed by Professor Susan Cooper at Plymouth Marjon University in 2012.
Originally designed to evaluate youth work programmes, TE has since been adapted for various educational settings, showcasing its versatility.
The methodology involves a series of structured evaluation activities, including encouraging participants to reflect on the evaluation process itself, therefore providing opportunities to improve the methodology’s implementation based on the needs of the context within which it is used.
Elpida Achtaridou Head of Research and Knowledge Exchange and Professor Jennie Winter , Dean of Teaching and Learning at Plymouth Marjon conducted the evaluation.
Elpida commented: “This important project unlocks ‘small n’ methodologies that can be used across the sector.
It can support evaluators in making informed decisions when choosing and implementing different ‘small n’ evaluation methodologies leading to robust findings.
I’m proud that Plymouth Marjon University was part of this innovative work.” The University’s project aimed to evaluate the Student Colleague scheme using TE, focusing on the scheme's impact on student employability outcomes.
Unlike traditional large-scale methodologies, which often prioritise quantitative data like statistics, TE emphasises qualitative insights.
Such insights allow for a deeper understanding of the initiative's effectiveness from the recipients’ perspective through brief stories of impact written in their own words This approach proved invaluable in evaluating the Student Colleague scheme's impact on student participants, providing rich insights into their experiences and the programme's overall effectiveness.
Professor Jennie Winter added: “We champion research and evaluation projects, especially that which directly impact our society and affect real social change.
Marjon is a pioneer of exciting new and innovative methodologies, and I’m looking forward to seeing how our work can positively impact the sector.” The success of Marjon's project underscores the University's commitment to innovation and excellence in Higher Education research.
The project delivered three comprehensive reports and offered valuable insights into the implementation of TE in a Higher Education context.
The project's findings have garnered significant attention, leading to invitations to present at various institutions nationally and internationally.
Plymouth Marjon University’s involvement in the TASO pilot on 'small n' evaluations highlights the University's leadership in driving methodological advancements in Higher Education research.
Through TE, Marjon is paving the way for new and innovative evaluation practices across the sector.
In November 2023, the University opened the Marjon Doctoral College, a centre for research excellence and postgraduate research opportunities.
As part of the South West Doctoral College Partnership and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , the University offers bursaries for social science PhD students to produce research to impact social change.

I have over 20 years experience in academia, with lecturing and management/strategic positions held across both further and higher education.
I currently work across various programmes in the School of Sport, Business & Media, and specialise in modules related to coaching, the management and development of sport, work-based placements, and more specifically, talent identification.
I enjoy seeing academic topics from the classroom being delivered in real-life practice, and this has often seen me integrating a range of industry-focused projects and partnerships into relevant modules.
This enables students to benefit from the development of employer-related skills and meaningful integration into local and regional sporting networks.
I believe that such real outcomes from learning are crucial to enhancing knowledge and understanding of complex social and sporting topics.
I recently completed my PhD, which used a relational approach to better understand the interactions, relations, ties and network formation in academy football.
This work provided an important and novel contribution to the talent identification and development literature, predominantly through the relational sociological theorising of Nick Crossley.
I have used some of this work to influence further scholarly activity and impact policymakers through presentations at national/international conferences, publications in academic journals, and knowledge exchange/workshops/CPD via the Premier League and Association of Sporting Directors.
I also have previous employment experience as a Development Officer, Coach, Coach Educator and Mentor across various levels of football.

Held the role of programme leader for both the BA Hons International Event & Sport Management programme, and the FdA Football Coaching & Development programme between 2011 and 2015.
My interests primarily revolve around the use of relational sociology to better understand interactions, relations and ties in sporting environments, and the impact that this may have on the constitution and configuration of networks.
This permits me to study, in depth, issues around the dynamics and mechanisms of interaction, the enabling and constraining features of relationships, impression management, power and exchanges of goods and services.
In particular, I am interested in the nuances and complexities in identifying and developing talent in sport and the micro-political aspects and emotions in the everyday doing of sports coaching practice.
My recent work has involved working with colleagues across academia and industry to deliver talks and workshops to impact practice.
Specifically, this has included talks to Academy Managers as part of a Premier League training programme in association with Liverpool University, and to the Association of Sporting Directors.
This presentation highlighted the use of official and unofficial networks when contemporary policy is enacted in football academies.
I enjoyed eight years working as a sports development practitioner in various settings, which included Active Partnerships, National Governing Bodies of sport, professional football clubs and specific national initiatives (Active Sports).
I was also an FA Coach Educator/Tutor for 10 years, and continue to work as a qualified football and rugby coach.

The word SCION means ‘a young shoot or twig of a plant, especially one cut for grafting or rooting’, a metaphor which seemed well suited for our inter-disciplinary research and knowledge exchange group.
It includes a mix of experienced researchers, practitioners and early career researchers and PhD students.
Our work links to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), part of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defined in 2015.
The seventeen SDGs focus on ending poverty and reducing inequality, while improving health and education – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve natural resources.
These goals align closely with the subject specialities and institutional values of Plymouth Marjon University and underpin development of our research and knowledge exchange.
Unlike many sustainability groups, the creative arts form a strong part of the interdisciplinary core of the group.
We explore a wide range of issues - bringing together theories of communication, education, behaviour change and performance with the big sustainability issues including climate change, community development and social responsibility.
Underpinning the research and knowledge exchange activities of the group is a collaborative, creative, and playful approach to work which opens up imaginative possibilities for problem-solving.
We specialise in participatory, action-oriented research which aims to have direct influence on the university and external partners through joint projects.
The group will also support the core principles of enhancing research-informed curricula in higher education, providing a focal point for students’ interest in sustainability and climate challenges, and for wider developments towards the sustainable university ideal.
If you’re a community group that would like to work with academic researchers, or an academic interested in collaboration, dissemination and impact, get in touch with us: Email: DCotton@Marjon.ac.uk Twitter:  @MarjonSCION

SCION project team: Dr Steve Disney , Dr Ellie Chadwick and Professor Debby Cotton working with colleagues at HUST , Vietnam.
This project, funded by the British Council as part of its Viet Nam Season , aims to raise the profile of climate change in Viet Nam and the UK by developing an open access audio-visual resource for use in English teaching and learning based on a public exhibition that integrates photography, sound and language.
Commencing in February 2023, it will involve: Co-creating with staff and students in the two institutions a themed, immersive, audio-visual mixed-mode exhibition with projections, imaging and 360 surround-sound.
It will include an open photographic competition, with small prizes, on a sustainability theme.
Staff and students will co-create an audio-visual showcase of materials on climate change using photos, posters, graphics, and immersive technology including binaural sound design.
The exhibition will showcase around 50 of the photographs in a ‘walkway’ style, with sound effects to enhance the experience.
Creating an open access online legacy version of the exhibition with English Language Teaching (ELT) material guidance.
The aim is to store artefacts from the exhibition on a permanent open access platform along with guidance for use in the classroom.
The artefacts will also be used to deliver classes in local schools.
Students will be involved throughout the project and particularly in the delivery to other schools, where they may return to their own previous school.
This project promotes strong collaborations between the institutions and subject areas in diverse and creative pedagogies, developing best-practice recommendations by encouraging teachers to use visual prompts, stories and poems, while integrating visual and immersive audio in teaching.
There is a lack of creative and engaging materials on climate change themes in ELT, yet this field provides one of the strongest opportunities for embedding climate change in teaching due to the sheer numbers of people who are learning English.
We believe that the audio-visual materials set based on the proposed project would encourage people to explore not only the topic, but to personalise their experience and feelings about the topic, with the potential outcome that they may feel more invested in climate action.
Commencing in February 2023, it will involve:

In July 2022, workshop facilitators and participants congregated at Rame Project studios to spend 3 days & 2 nights examining novel approaches to actor training in rural Cornwall.
The collective enjoyed communal meals each day and music by the campfire in the evening.
An attempted non-hierarchical structure was put in place and facilitated by those in participation, with a strong focus on phenomenology and experiential encounter in the natural world.
This included a series of exercises, tasks, and workshops in the rural environment, designed to nurture creative expression in response to site, space, and place, supporting investigation into the theme of training in nature.
Outputs: Artistic responses to experience shared by the group were shared with the public at an open event on the final day of the residential, with creative process documented by local artist Siobhan Bauer who is creating an art film documentary, due to premier in April 2023.
The project is currently in its data analysis phase, with results to be published in due course.

This is an update on our latest research into the challenges faced by schools in coastal regions and how they have sought to overcome them.
The research team are Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope PFHEA, Professor of Education at Plymouth Marjon University and Dr Rowena Passy at the University of Plymouth.
Massive investment in London has led to its rise as an education superpower, succeeding despite high levels of deprivation.
Coastal schools, however (here defined within 5.5km of the coast of England) appear to face continuing challenges that impact on performance (Ovenden-Hope and Passy, 2015).
There were signs that in 2012 the Coalition government had begun to recognise the poverty in coastal regions: âMany seaside towns and villages have suffered decades of economic decline.
Many young people, for example, have moved away from coastal areas due to a lack of job opportunities.
We need to invest in coastal towns to help their economies grow and reduce unemployment and deprivationâ (Department for Communities and Local Government, 2012).
The schoolsâ performance watchdog Ofsted (Ofsted, 2013; see also Weale, 2014) identified a link between student performance and âdeprived coastal townsâ, with a realisation that these areas have âfelt little impact from national initiatives designed to drive up the standards for the poorest childrenâ (Ofsted, 2013).
Yet recent reports by the current government (DfE, 2016) have rejected claims that socio-economically deprived coastal regions face specific challenges in education because of their geography, economies and social contexts.
It is therefore reassuring that Ofstedâs Annual Report 2016 identified issues for schools in isolated and deprived areas: âThere is also considerable evidence that it is schools in isolated and deprived areas where educational standards are low that are losing out in the recruitment stakes for both leaders and teachersâ (Ofsted, 2016).
The way in which the current government has categorised and reported data on coastal schools makes these isolated schools (and isolation is not only about geography; it can include isolation from other schools, economic opportunities and wider social experiences) appear to have similar outcomes to other schools (Ovenden-Hope and Passy, 2016).
In government data coastal schools as established as a category and compared to the category âall other inland schoolsâ, which includes rural and urban schools.
When rural schools are taken out of the category âall other inland schoolsâ, the remaining schoolsâ data suggests a difference when compared to coastal schoolsâ data (DfE, 2016).
There are similarities in the issues reported on coastal and rural schools: âIn terms of intake and performance, coastal schools appear to face comparable challenges to other schools that are similarly isolated and deprivedâ (Centre Forum, 2016).
There were signs that in 2012 the Coalition government had begun to recognise the poverty in coastal regions:
âMany seaside towns and villages have suffered decades of economic decline.

âThere is also considerable evidence that it is schools in isolated and deprived areas where educational standards are low that are losing out in the recruitment stakes for both leaders and teachersâ (Ofsted, 2016).
There are similarities in the issues reported on coastal and rural schools:
âIn terms of intake and performance, coastal schools appear to face comparable challenges to other schools that are similarly isolated and deprivedâ (Centre Forum, 2016).
There is evidence in performance data that shows differences in attainment for coastal schools e.g.
at Key Stage 2.
Less disadvantaged, non-isolated schools that are outside coastal areas have 3 percentage points higher Level 5 attainment rates and 0.02 National Curriculum Levelsâ better progress than those in coastal areas (Centre Forum, 2016).
SchoolDash , which analyses education data, examined the performance of coastal schools for 2015 GCSE results showed that pupils in coastal schools were on average achieving 3% lower results than inland schools, based on the benchmark five A*-C GCSEs including English and maths.
The figures also show that coastal schools have a more deprived intake, with 3% more pupils eligible for free school meals - a figure similar to the achievement gap.
There are exceptions, however.
The SchoolDash data shows that places such as North Tyneside and Lancashire coastal schools outperform their inland counterparts, and there are some coastal areas which are conspicuously affluent.
But the national picture shows a trend of overall lower performance in coastal schools.
Thomson (2015) reported that there was a lower rate of relative progress from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 4 among Pupil Premium pupils attending coastal schools, predominantly white British pupils in disadvantaged areas.
As Ofsted Chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has articulated, problems for schools can stem from "isolation", and he acknowledged last year that as well as being physically isolated, too often coastal schools are cut off from the help they need (access to school to school support and professional development opportunities) and the pressure to do better (local competition).
âThese schools [coastal] are deprived of effective support when times are bad.
They are left unchallenged when they flirt with complacencyâ (Michael Wilshaw, cited in Weale, 2015).
Little has been done in the last couple of years to address the wider political issue of parity in education.
Schools outside London and some other cities have not received government support, resource or investment to challenge intergenerational underachievement.
Children from white British socio-economically deprived backgrounds do better in London and the cities than they do in coastal towns and deprived areas.
The State of the Nation Report 2017 even identified that: âIsolated rural and coastal towns and former industrial areas feature heavily as social mobility coldspots.
Young people growing up in these areas have less chance of achieving good educational outcomes and often end up trapped by a lack of access to further education and employment opportunities.â (Social Mobility Commission, 2017: 2) Until economic and educational resources are allocated according to school need, then the gap in performance and issues with teacher and leader recruitment will continue.
The cause of gaps in attainment in isolated communities is more complex than low income, as the data for the Isle of Wight shows (similar pupil premium numbers to the national average, yet specific coastal schools have significant underperformance).
Poor teacher and leadership recruitment to schools in these areas is a response to the full isolation of schools situation - economic, geographic, social and educational.
The State of the Nation Report 2017 even identified that:
âIsolated rural and coastal towns and former industrial areas feature heavily as social mobility coldspots.
Young people growing up in these areas have less chance of achieving good educational outcomes and often end up trapped by a lack of access to further education and employment opportunities.â (Social Mobility Commission, 2017: 2)
Until economic and educational resources are allocated according to school need, then the gap in performance and issues with teacher and leader recruitment will continue.
Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope and Dr Rowena Passy engaged with the coastal schools research through three related studies that explored how coastal schools (newly sponsored âfirst phaseâ academies) approached the task of changing school culture to effect school improvement: a seven year longitudinal study following one academy from the time of conversion in 2010 (The Class of 2010) a âpilotâ study of three first phase coastal academies Comparative analysis of six first phase academies located in seaside towns/cities in England It was a qualitative investigation in which we studied publicly-available data; examined school documentation; Interviewed principal/executive principal in each school and interviewed a sample of four teachers in each school.
The findings, when considered together, suggest that schools in socioeconomically deprived coastal communities have common characteristics.
School performance appeared affected by school isolation; Geographical, Socioeconomic and Educational.
These isolating factors appeared to have an impact on five critical issues: Student attainment Student expectations Staff expectations Teacher recruitment Teacher retention
Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope and Dr Rowena Passy engaged with the coastal schools research through three related studies that explored how coastal schools (newly sponsored âfirst phaseâ academies) approached the task of changing school culture to effect school improvement:
It was a qualitative investigation in which we studied publicly-available data; examined school documentation; Interviewed principal/executive principal in each school and interviewed a sample of four teachers in each school.
These isolating factors appeared to have an impact on five critical issues:
Socioeconomic isolation was reported by teachers and school leaders as consisting of: seasonal and/or minimum wage local employment few manufacturing and/or professional opportunities multi-generational low or unemployment Compounded by other factors: geographical isolation depleted and stalled economy low skills base in the community falling demand for property giving rise to cheap housing
Socioeconomic isolation was reported by teachers and school leaders as consisting of:
Compounded by other factors:
Student Attainment in the schools in the research was below expected standards and the schools selected for investigation were all national challenge schools prior to changing to academy status in 2010.
Student attainment in the six coastal academies in our research since 2010 demonstrated: Improvement following sponsored conversion (from national challenge circumstances) from 2010 to 2013 (5 GCSEâs inc E&M) All schools demonstrated a decline in student attainment from 2013, especially in E&M, by 2017.
All six schools except one experience the school principal that implemented the academy sponsorship leaving within three years.
Post 2013 saw rapid and radical changes in education policy relating to school performance measures, curriculum and school responsibilities.
Both of these factors were considered as reasons affecting the trajectories in school performance recorded by the DfE.
Student attainment in the six coastal academies in our research since 2010 demonstrated:
Student and staff expectations and aspirations were low in all six schools in 2010: â I mean I've thought about it with the seaside thing â¦ Itâs the redundancies in the 80s and early 90s where a huge amount of males were made redundant â¦ Now we're teaching â¦ probably the second generation of kids that have gone through a whole life [without seeing their parents employed] â¦ I think that's got a lot to do with it.
They just, they don't see, they don't connect school with employment â¦ I would say on the whole, the vast majority of the boys just don't see a future, [a connection] between what they're doing in this place and what's going to be happening in 18 monthsâ time .â (Senior leader).
Many staff expected low parental engagement, poor student behaviour and low aspirations.
Establishing a culture where staff and student expectations were raised was a huge challenge.
Parentâs poor experiences of education (and typically the school their children were attending), along with poor local employment opportunities and conditions appeared to create a lack of parental engagement with the schools.
Student and staff expectations and aspirations were low in all six schools in 2010:

Teacher recruitment and retention was a key challenge in the coastal schools studied.
Recruitment: Limited employment prospects for partners of teachers, school leaders Those (typically young and NQTs) not in relationships wanted a wide range of social opportunities not available Retention: Lack of âchurnâ in long serving teachers (low house prices disabling opportunities to move to more expensive/affluent areas; low school to school professional mobility due to absence of closely located schools) Higher attrition of early career teachers (low social, cultural opportunities They said: âOur location â¦ is rural and coastal, so you've got a limited pool of people to pull fromâ (School Leader).
âWe're actually finding that now it's not only the STEM subjects, but it's the other subjects across the board that we're finding difficulty in recruiting.
â¦ I need, desperately need a Learning Director for English because my current one is going to be retiring at the end of the year; I've advertised twice now and I've got not a single biteâ (School Leader).

They said:
âOur location â¦ is rural and coastal, so you've got a limited pool of people to pull fromâ (School Leader).
Educational isolation was characterised by: No/or limited access to a local university (in all but one case) Struggling or âcoastingâ schools in same locality, with reduced access to high performing schools âThere is no outstanding secondary school, whereas if you went to a metropolitan area we would see the outstanding secondary schools.
They've been loaded, they've had designations such as National Support Schools, the National Leaders of Education and they, in many instances, are the local hubs in school improvementâ.
(School Leader) Absence of school improvement initiatives Inward-looking nature of school improvement âSome of the initiatives which I've been used to in city areas weren't immediately apparent here.
And so the really strong, sharply-focused school improvement initiatives which were spawned out of first National Strategies and then the City Challenges, they were conspicuous in their absenceâ (School Leader) âWhat you donât get is a lot of refresh.
So in big cities and conurbations, you get movement in and out â¦ [Here, schools] tend to look inwards for their solutions and for school improvement.
I think thatâs a massive riskâ (School Leader) The DfE (2016: 52) stated that âthere does not appear to be much difference between coastal and inland schoolsâ (p.
52), but disaggregated DfE (2016) data shows: Fewer teachers move to other schools from coastal and rural schools compared with inland urban schools Fewer new entrants to coastal and rural than all inland schools Fewer NQTs in coastal and rural than all inland schools This is supported by Social Mobility Commission data reported in the State of the Nation Report 2017: 39: âThe most deprived coastal rural areas have one and half times the proportion of unqualified teachers that the least deprived inland rural areas haveâ¦Schools in densely populated urban areas benefit from support from nearby âoutstandingâ schools but schools in rural and coastal areas are isolated and unable to tap into partnership infrastructure for supportâ.

The DfE (2016: 52) stated that âthere does not appear to be much difference between coastal and inland schoolsâ (p.
52), but disaggregated DfE (2016) data shows:
This is supported by Social Mobility Commission data reported in the State of the Nation Report 2017: 39:
âThe most deprived coastal rural areas have one and half times the proportion of unqualified teachers that the least deprived inland rural areas haveâ¦Schools in densely populated urban areas benefit from support from nearby âoutstandingâ schools but schools in rural and coastal areas are isolated and unable to tap into partnership infrastructure for supportâ.
The Class of 2010: A seven year study of a coastal academy in England â In common with other coastal schools, this academy is located in an area of high socio-economic deprivation, with multi-generational low and/or unemployment, and local parents/carers who had often had poor experiences of education.
There are very high levels of students recorded as pupil premium/ever 6 free school meals, demonstrating persistent disadvantage as the common denominator for students in the school.
The socio-economic position of the community in which this coastal school is located clearly has an impact on senior leaders, teachers, students and parents .â (Ovenden-Hope and Passy, 2017: 29) From 2010 - 2017, Tanya Ovenden-Hope and Rowena Passy followed the journey of a coastal school that was in the âfirst waveâ of schools required (due to ânational challengeâ circumstances of underperformance) to convert to academy status with the support of sponsors.
The challenges faced by the school due to its coastal and socio-economical disadvantaged location and its new independent status, together with the wide-reaching ambitions of the academy leaders, offered a unique opportunity to document and explore the changes, challenges and successes for students, staff and the school.
How would the new academy develop?
What challenges would the new leaders face?
How would changes be received and experienced by staff and students?
Would the curriculum support and engage students?
Would being an academy improve school performance?
Academy leaders and sponsors agreed to a seven-year longitudinal study that would include exploring the secondary educational experience of the Year 7 cohort, the Class of 2010, the first students to enter the new academy.
The aims of the study were to: explore the senior leadership aims and priorities, and how these might change and develop over time.
investigate teachersâ perceptions of teaching, learning and assessment within the academy.
monitor the academic progress of the student cohort that entered the academy as Year 7 in 2010 understand the educational journey of a sample of 15 Year 7 students.
Each year we visited the academy and interviewed the principal and/or a senior leader, four different teachers of the Class of 2010 and the Class of 2010 students.
We also studied the academyâs publicly-available data, examined academy documents and collected the anonymised student cohort data on levels of progress and attainment.
We anticipated that the Class of 2010 project would yield detailed understanding of the development of the academy as a new institution, of the progress and outcomes for this cohort of students, and of staff and student views on the impact of the education offered by the academy.
We were interested in the additional challenges schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage appeared to face and in particular those in coastal regions (see Ovenden-Hope and Passy, 2015 report on coastal academies ).
Annual reporting of this information to the academy would help to raise the profile of the student and teacher voice, offer the opportunity to report on different strategies and developments, with findings offering the potential to be used to shape internal decisions.
In addition, we intended that national and international dissemination of the findings could help to influence thinking on the challenges for other coastal schools and consequential strategic, operational or policy decisions.
Something we did not anticipate, however, was that fundamental changes within the academy would coincide with far-reaching and rapid changes within English secondary education.
Two different government administrations and a series of policy directives placed new pressures on the school at a time in which leaders were already implementing extensive changes aimed at the primary measure of school accountability â student performance in formal examinations.
This makes the study particularly valuable as a means of illustrating policy impacts at a challenging time in English education.

'Educational Isolation: a challenge for schools in England' aims to provide an understanding of this complexity through a considered definition of ‘educational isolation’ and to support schools in accessing resources for school improvement through recommendations for policy makers, funding agencies/organisations and stakeholders.
This fluidity makes definition difficult, and the one presented in the report is purposefully broad to encompass the many combinations of challenges of location and consequential limited access to specific resources.
The reports are authored by Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope of Plymouth Marjon University and Dr Rowena Passy of The University of Plymouth.

Professor Tanya Ovenden-Hope and Dr Rowena Passy share interim findings from Year 1 and Year 2 of a three year qualitive research project (2019 – 2022) in this report.
The project offers a case study of a new large multi-academy trust that created a Hub model to mitigate the effects of educational isolation on it schools.
This is the final report by Professor Ovenden-Hope and Dr.
Rowena Passy that offers insights into the efficacy of a Hub model, introduced by a new multi-academy trust (MAT), for supporting 20 educationally isolated schools in accessing resources.
The three year research project explored the experiences of the Hub model from all of the MAT’s school leaders’ perspectives and that of the trusts’ executive leadership.
The key finding is that locality matters.
Bringing school leaders together in local Hubs of schools to established trusted and supportive relationships works for enhanced collaboration and the sharing of resources.
Interestingly, school leaders felt less isolated when working in local of Hub with other school leaders that understood their leadership challenges.
They were able to express more openly their needs for support and to offer support in return.
This benefitted the MAT, with school leaders developing confidence to share resources that had worked at the local Hub level  with the MAT level where appropriate.
Schools are complex and educationally isolated schools experience the additional complexity of place-based challenges.
After three years the Hub model was embedding within the MAT and emerging issues in the context for the constitution of Hubs, and the clarity and capacity in the role of the Hub lead, were identified.
This said, the Hub model mitigated some of the thorny outcomes of the place-based challenges for educationally isolated schools and is a promising model for more equitable school access to resources.
Listen to the Locality Matters Report podcast
The study’s key message is that governance innovation must balance efficiency gains with preservation of local voice and community connection .
The research demonstrates that while hub models can address systemic challenges like governor recruitment and administrative burden, successful implementation requires substantial investment in communication strategies, stakeholder engagement mechanisms, and ongoing professional development.
The study's core insight is that the future of local governance within MATs depends not on the specific structural model adopted, but on the quality of relationships, clarity of roles, and effectiveness of communication systems that underpin governance practice .
In essence, the HAB model show promise but requires sustained work to maintain democratic accountability and community engagement alongside operational efficiency.
What Works Well The HAB model demonstrates several clear operational benefits : Reduces administrative burden on headteachers through streamlined processes Improves strategic focus for trustees by consolidating reporting from multiple schools Enables better collaboration between schools within geographical clusters Addresses recruitment challenges by requiring fewer but more skilled governors Promotes consistency in governance practices across the Trust What Doesn't Work (Yet) However, the research reveals implementation challenges : Community Disconnect Parents that responded to the survey feel "distanced from the governance of the school" and describe the model as "remote, disconnected and self-serving" Role Confusion Nearly half of HAB members lack clarity about their role after 19 months Half of senior leaders believe HABs don't effectively engage with stakeholders Accountability Gaps HABs struggle to provide effective challenge and support to individual schools The advisory nature of HAB recommendations limits their authority to effect real change Emma Knights OBE, Former Chief Executive of the National Governance Association: “Talk about cluster or hub level governance instead of a local tier has surfaced again in the sector in the last two years, driven by the difficulty of volunteer recruitment.
I would encourage all those considering such a change to read this report”.
Emma Balchin, CEO of the National Governance Association for Schools and Trusts: “This important research by Plymouth Marjon University arrives at a critical juncture for multi-academy trust governance”.
What Works Well
The HAB model demonstrates several clear operational benefits :
What Doesn't Work (Yet)
However, the research reveals implementation challenges :
Community Disconnect
Role Confusion
Accountability Gaps

This web based resource was produced as part of a European project funded by Erasmus+ Key Action 2 in the field of ‘Strategic Partnerships for Youth’, and the title of the key action was ‘Cooperation for innovation and the exchange of good practices’.
The project was entitled ‘Developing and Communicating the Impact of Youth Work in Europe’, and the reference number was 2015-3-UK01-KA205-022861.
The project, led by Associate Professor Jon Ord , took place between 2016 and 2018 and aimed to independently identify the impact of open access youth work in each of the following five European countries – the UK (England), Finland, Estonia, Italy and France.
A participatory evaluation methodology entitled ‘Transformative Evaluation’ was used to generate young people’s own accounts of the impact of youth work on their lives.
One of the outputs of the project was to provide free access to on-line training resources to enable the use of Transformative Evaluation more widely.
The materials below were created by Dr Susan Cooper, and have been translated to support access.
We hope that you will find these useful.
Please do share your experience with us if you use these resources as feedback is a valuable source for further development of the methodology.

Our student-led knowledge exchange project (SLKE) explores the impact of student involvement in health and wellbeing clinics.
The project (SLKE) builds on Marjonâs success in promoting knowledge exchange through student involvement in health and wellbeing clinics .
As UK health policy moves increasingly toward a preventative model focusing on health behaviour modification such as increased physical activity, dietary change, and patient self-care, these types of clinics are becoming central to the work of healthcare professionals.
Marjon has been running activities, which promote health and well-being in the workplace and in complex multi-morbid communities for many years.
We are recognised as offering an exemplary service for the local community, working alongside local partners, as well as providing opportunities for enhancing student development and employability.
This project will use a transformative evaluation to help us understand and further enhance the opportunities of student involvement in these clinics.
It will investigate the ways and extent to which these initiatives contribute to student learning, in addition to the positive impacts on partners and patients.
Equally, it will assess the barriers and potential for wider utilisation of student-led knowledge exchange activities in higher education.
This project aims to explore the conditions, which allow a SLKE culture to flourish in undergraduate teaching and learning, and to develop a model for wider use.
It aims to enhance student reflection and learning through transformative evaluation, to explore the drivers and barriers for SLKE from the perspective of students, academics and partners, and to promote scaling up of SLKE activities across the institution, region and nationally.

The Marjon Health and Wellbeing model delivers person-centred support to encourage healthy lifestyles for all.
Self management and education are at the core of our approach.
It is simple, evidence based and easily scaled so that it can be adapted to suit a range of conditions and diseases.
For over 10 years we have run non-medical physical activity based programmes with Sentinel Health Care to help people manage their back pain.
This involves encouraging those with back pain to start being more active, as well as wellbeing advice on sleep and nutrition, and education on how pain works in the body.
Students are involved with helping guide patients through various activities such as Nordic walking, using the gym and pool, as well as general strengthening, core exercises, and stretching.
âThe behaviour techniques used in Marjonâs approach have motivated and empowered individuals to maintain adherence to exercise and healthy lifestyles within their own circumstances, beyond the duration of the service.
In doing so our service reduces both primary and secondary care referrals reducing cost and strain on front line services.
This fills a gap within current NHS rehabilitation provision.â Sentinel Health Care
â Four hundred officers have attended since 2018.
We have also trained 32 police personal trainers to deliver and apply Marjon approach to health and wellbeing for our workforce.
In addition onlibe infographics and posters were shared allowing officers from all over Devon and Cornwall and Dorset to access the expert fitness, dietary, sleep, & wellbeing advice.
The collaboration with Marjon University has produced some startling results allowing our senior management team to better understand what specific wellness support is required for each team.
Some of the key findings included 86% of frontline officers were experiencing MSK pain in work; 52% had never had a health check prior to the visit; 93% said the visit improved how supported they feel by the organization .â Devon and Cornwall Police
Moving more and getting active during or after cancer treatment can help prevent or manage some of the side effects.

â Marjon have enabled the creation of a service which is unique within Devon and Cornwall NHS provision, for patients diagnosed with cancer.
Patients participating in Marjonâs programmes are in a better physical and mental condition than those who have not engaged, patients have reported that their ability to cope with treatment, including recovery from surgery, is improved .
Patient benefits are wide ranging and include improved quality of life, social interaction as well as reduced negative effects of treatment and anxiety levels .â The Mustard Tree Macmillan Cancer Centre
Our Cancer Prehab project improves conditioning prior to surgery, producing better results in surgery and helping patients recover more quickly.
This work is part of a wider project with Plymouth NHS Trust utilising interval training and support to improve cancer patient fitness and subsequent outcomes of surgery.
Our partnership with Livewell Southwest started in January 2017 with our pilot group helping people with leg ulcers improve their leg health and circulation through seated exercise and nutrition advice.
This has since become a full service and spread to six venues across South West Devon.
The long-term conditions project is a new initiative started in June 2019.
Again working with Livewell Southwest we deliver a six week programme to help local people who have been recently diagnosed with a long term condition so that they learn how to manage their health more effectively.
â Informed by Marjonâs Research, we developed a new integrated care community service for the management of leg ulcers (our lower limb service).
Marjon helped us move the service into a community, non-medical setting and provide the patients with group lifestyle and wellbeing classes that focused on person-centred care.
This environment has been especially liberating for our elderly patients who, despite having healed, did not want to leave the service given the high levels of enjoyment.
Our routine assessments on the impact of the service, conducted by nurses, indicated 80% accelerated healing rates in people.
For the last three years our wellbeing classes have supported over a thousand people each year and people have reported high levels of satisfaction in measures of quality of life and functional capacity.
â Livewell Southwest
Marjon Health and Wellbeing and Ernesettle Health Centre are collaborating on a groundbreaking project which could prompt a fundamental rethink in how healthcare is delivered.
Ernesettle Medical Centre has received a grant from the Health Foundation to support the project, which centres on the provision of group sessions, with both a GP and a Health Coach, for patients suffering with persistent pain.
The project will investigate whether shared medical appointments, that bring together medical and non-medical aspects of pain management, in tandem with group discussions, can give patients using opioid medication to manage chronic pain more control over their condition.
We are also running a GP referral exercise programme in a gym on-site at the medical centre at Ernesettle.
"The current medical model of primary care typically only provides GPs ten minutes to dedicate to their patients.
Our Shared Medical Appointments model, based on Marjonâs research approach, supported an inclusive 2-hour session that enabled continuity for care for patients beyond their condition .
Marjonâs expertise enabled us to design relevant and appropriate outcome measures which showed a reduction in one-to-one GP appointments, reduced use of other healthcare services such as out-of-hours GP service, reduction in medication queries, reduced use of pain medication and enhanced satisfaction for those receiving and delivering care .â Evalesco Consulting.
Due to start in 2019, we will be providing a falls prevention programme for NHS Devon in rural areas surrounding Plymouth with our staff qualified as postural stability instructors.
â The reach and impact of the Marjon Health and Wellbeing approach has extended to all of our depots in Devon and Cornwall with increased morale, reduced sickness absence and improved productivity of our staff.
It has gained interest from National Directors and has potential to be adopted by the Environment Agency Nationwide .
The attendance at the programme provides a mini community where the staff now are encouraged to reflect on their behaviours, experiment with some content they are prescribed, and share their progress and experiences with staff and peers alike.
It is by nature a person centred, holistic approach that can also flex to each participants needs .â The Environment Agency

I am a member of the Expert Advisory Panel for the Healthy Child Programme 0-18, e-learning for healthcare resource, and co-editor of the Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN) module.
The SLCN sessions, which have been endorsed by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, are designed for health visitors, family practitioners, nurses and the child health team and promote knowledge and understanding of typical SLC development as well as SLC disorders.
They also describe likely clinical management pathways associated with a wide range of conditions including Down Syndrome, Autism, Hearing Impairment and Cleft Palate.
The resource is free to all NHS employees via e-learning for healthcare www.e-lfh.org.uk .
I have been an External Examiner for the BSc in Speech and Language Therapy, University College Cork, 2018-2022; PG Dip/MSc in Cleft Palate Studies, Speech Difficulties and Speech and Cleft, University of Sheffield, 2012-2016; BSc in Speech and Language Therapy, University of East Anglia, 2011-15 and the BSc in Speech and Language Therapy, De Montfort University, 2006-09.
Having been raised on Dr Seuss (of 'foxes in socks' fame) I am a strong believer in the importance and value of sound play for early speech and literacy development.
I was therefore very excited when asked to author the Early Soundplay series for Clickety Books Ltd.
This set which now comprises fifteen ‘sound-loaded’ stories can be shared with any child aged 2;0 – 5;0 yrs or used as part of therapy programme to support children with speech and language difficulties.
The first three books: Chatty Bat , Jake’s Cakes and Clip Clop’s Picnic received a Practical Preschool Gold Award in 2014 and the second set: Erica’s Chicks , Trish the Fish and Flo the Flamingo , a Practical Preschool Silver Award in 2015.
As well as sound play, I love cycling and in fact have composed most of the Early Soundplay stories whilst riding along the cliffs where I live.
I also love gardening and reading in the sun.

I am a lecturer on the BSc (Hons) Psychotherapy and Counselling degree at Plymouth Marjon University, as well as a BACP Accredited Counsellor/Psychotherapist.
The majority of my clinical experience is in supporting students within Higher Education; as a Counsellor/Psychotherapist, a Specialist Mental Health Mentor, or in other Student Support and Welfare roles.
Other than Higher Education settings, I have worked for several mental health charities and services across South Yorkshire.
I have also volunteered as an external ethics reviewer for universities.
These different, but often related experiences have helped inform my research interests.
PhD in Psychology, Sheffield Hallam University MSc in Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP Accredited), University of Derby PG Certificate in Counselling Skills, University of Derby BSc (Hons) in Psychology, University of Sheffield
I primarily teach on the Psychotherapy and Counselling degrees, with an interest in Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy, Psychology, Anti-Discriminatory practice and Dissertations/Research Methods (Quantitative and Qualitative).
I am also the Placement Coordinator for Psychotherapy and Counselling.
My experience working with students inspired my PhD; invetsigating perfectionism and well-being in UK ndergraduates.
Using a large data-set, I explored relationships between students' multi-dimensional perfectionism, anxiety, worry, resilience, well-being and social media use.
I also developed, implemented and evaluated a dual-factor intervention for perfectionist students, combining Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and Positive Psychology.
My research interests include: Factors that impact students' mental health and wellbeing, e.g., transition to university, social media use, academic attainment and wider socio-political and contextual factors Higher Education professional and student support services; impacts, challenges and solutions for delivery Multi-dimensional perfectionism, well-being, procrastination and self compassion.
Counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions Cognitive, Behavioural and Positive Psychology approaches I have also worked as a research assistant for projects such as GrowPlus (positive psychology interventions for university students) and a project funded by Royal College of Nursing; a mixed-methods investigation exploring mental health nursing provisions for children and young people.

Other than enjoying teaching and research, I'm also a keen rock climber, a caffeine-obsessive, a travel-enthusiast, and a frequent-music-festival-goer; rarely am I seen without music or the radio on!

Research interests My key interests are around sustainability, education and behaviour change, primarily in the following areas: Sustainability and Pedagogy in Higher Education - I am interested in teachers' and students' beliefs about and understandings of sustainability, and how sustainability is taught and learnt.
My current research is exploring students' energy literacy.
Promoting sustainable behaviours - areas of work include exploring energy-saving behaviour, nature connection and behaviour change, and communication about climate change and sustainability.
Widening Participation and Inclusivity in Higher Education - I have been involved in several projects investigating the experiences of non-traditional students in HE, including work on the gender and ethnicity attainment gap, an evaluation of the National Scholarship Programme and research with care leavers in HE.
Internationalisation - various areas of interest including internationalisation of the curriculum (internationalisation at home), as well as international comparative research related to sustainability (including Europe, Brazil and China).
I also have a keen interest in the use of innovative research methodologies, including the use of the 'think aloud method', and using student-led video diaries in research.
I have expertise in ChatGPT and higher education (including academic integrity and pedagogic considerations).

Following this, my PhD had a construction grammar focus, and also looked at the historical development of some so-called "semi-modals".
This has informed my interests in usage-based approaches to Second Language Acquisition, and my research interests now focus on learners of English.
I am currently researching the interaction between phonology and morphology in Vietnamese leaners.
I am also leading a photographic exhibition and ELT materials development project with our partners in the School of Foreign Languages at the University of Science & Technology in Hanoi, Vietnam, which is funded by the British Council.
