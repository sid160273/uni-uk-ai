Four students take on the ultimate breakfast challenge while learning all about the financial support that's available to them during their studies at Bedfordshire!.
“My top money tips would be to consider having a part-time job whilst at university and to budget for things such as food shopping, eating out, rent and travel.
For food shopping, make a list and stick to it as this avoids browse buying.
Shopping around for essentials, such as food and clothing, can save you a bit of money as you can often find certain products cheaper in different shops.
“If possible, try to make savings using student discount apps such as unidays and reward cards such as a Tesco Clubcard or Nectar card.
These can be a great way to save money on food shopping and to get points.
“Having a maintenance loan and bursaries has helped me to stay on top of my personal finance.
I know not all students will have access to these though so I’d recommend looking at how much money you spent during your first semester and then working out how you need to alter your budget for the following semester.
”.
“My advice for managing money at university would be to look at how you can split up your student finance loan over a semester to make sure you’re not overspending in the first half of the semester.
I have also found bulk cooking and food shopping in cheaper supermarkets to be great ways to save money.
I’d also say see if you can apply for the cost of living hardship fund if you’re struggling.
Your university student support team should be able to guide you through the process.
“My advice on how to be money smart is limiting the amount of food shopping needed by sharing the essentials with my flat mates and living in student accommodation, which covers bills.
As I was working before coming to university, I was able to save some money, and with the additional help of the student maintenance loan, it really helped me manage my finances.
“My top tips for managing money as a university student are to budget and prep for meals as often as you can.
As the Student Union’s 2022/23 Co-Vice President for Campus Engagement & Equality at the University of Bedfordshire, I was involved in setting up a Community Pantry, which is a place where our students can come and receive free groceries and other products, like sanitary items and toiletries.
